The model was based on experiential training, where both trainees and supervisors could build skills as they reflect on their process as learners and teachers.\nResidents' ratings at the end of rotation indicated extremely high satisfaction with the course.\nWe advocate that an experiential interdisciplinary course serving as an introduction to family assessment and systemic/reflective principles are valuable skills that have lasting value to general psychiatry residents."}, {"Title": "Romanian adolescents: literature review and psychiatric presentation of romanian adolescents adopted in romania and in Canada.", "Abstract": "This article presents an overview of literature on the psychiatric sequelae of institutionalization from an attachment perspective in children adopted from Romanian Orphanages.\nWe compare the psychiatric presentations of Romanian Canadian adoptees to same age Romanian adoptees within Romania.\n10 Canadian and 24 Romanian cases were combined to form a composite of a number of adolescents presenting to the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Division in Cluj Napoca, Romania and in Kingston, Canada.\nEarly institutionalization in conditions of neglect and deprivation has a major impact on subsequent biopsychosocial development of children whether they are adopted in Canada or in Romania."}, {"Title": "A transient-chaotic autoassociative network (TCAN) based on Lee oscillators.", "Abstract": "In the past few decades, neural networks have been extensively adopted in various applications ranging from simple synaptic memory coding to sophisticated pattern recognition problems such as scene analysis. Moreover, current studies on neuroscience and physiology have reported that in a typical scene segmentation problem our major senses of perception (e.g., vision, olfaction, etc.) are highly involved in temporal (or what we call \"transient\") nonlinear neural dynamics and oscillations. This paper is an extension of the author's previous work on the dynamic neural model (EGDLM) of memory processing and on composite neural oscillators for scene segmentation. Moreover, it is inspired by the work of Aihara et al. and Wang on chaotic neural oscillators in pattern association. In this paper, the author proposes a new transient chaotic neural oscillator, namely the \"Lee oscillator,\" to provide temporal neural coding and an information processing scheme. To illustrate its capability for memory association, a chaotic autoassociative network, namely the Transient-Chaotic Auto-associative Network (TCAN) was constructed based on the Lee oscillator. Different from classical autoassociators such as the celebrated Hopfield network, which provides a \"time-independent\" pattern association, the TCAN provides a remarkable progressive memory association scheme [what we call \"progressive memory recalling\" (PMR)] during the transient chaotic memory association. This is exactly consistent with the latest research in psychiatry and perception psychology on dynamic memory recalling schemes."}, {"Title": "A study of skin disorders in patients with primary psychiatric conditions.", "Abstract": "The skin occupies a powerful position as an organ of communication and plays an important role in socialization throughout life.

One of such instruments is SCAN, an instrument which uses computer algorithm to make a diagnosis. It is meant to be used for semi-structured interview by qualified psychiatrists or clinical psychologists. This and a few other research instruments have been translated and used in clinical and community settings for psychiatric research in Ethiopia over the last few years. In this study computer assisted SCAN Diagnoses and clinical diagnoses made by trainee psychiatrists in Butajira, a rural setting in Ethiopia, were compared Seven hundred twenty nine persons were diagnosed to have schizophrenia and bipolar disorder using both methods. The agreement between the clinical and SCAN derived diagnosis was shown to be 100% for schizophrenia (Kappa = 1.0). However, the agreement between the two methods of diagnosis was shown to be lower when it comes to subtypes of schizophrenia. The agreement for the diagnoses of bipolar disorder was 95.3%, kappa = 0.9, P < 0.0001 and for depression it was 93.0%, kappa = 0.8, p < 0.0001.

It draws on transcripts of interviews recorded in the course of carrying out research into schizophrenia in this group. The article examines three different interview spaces within the longhouse--public, family, and private--in order to explore the interplay between ethnographic context and interview conversation. The public setting is notable for the number of relatives who join in and transform the communication from dyadic to collective interlocution; the role of repetition in recruiting them into the conversation is explored. Indirect contrast is the private space, which allows for a level of confidentiality commensurate with Western psychiatric research practice. Intermediate between the two is the family space. The communicative forms that correspond to these settings influence the way symptoms of schizophrenia are experienced and expressed in the Iban.

In this paper we briefly contrast the different meanings of the word in psychiatry and philosophy. We then consider the work of the philosophers Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, as examples of what Hubert Dreyfus calls ontological phenomenology, in contrast to an epistemological approach. We present a brief outline of Merleau-Ponty's theory of embodiment, and contrast this with the dominant, epistemological (or Cartesian) view of experience. Through the example of a woman who experienced bereavement hallucinations, we try to show how this approach can open up a hermeneutic approach to the experience of hearing voices. An understanding of embodiment can help to counter reductionism, whether biological or social, and dualism (body/mind and mind/society). It is only when we consider the totality of human experience that we can understand its meaning. This has two main benefits. First, it legitimates the claims made by those who hear voices that their experiences are intrinsically meaningful. Second, it can provide a framework for those who work with voice hearers and who are interested in understanding these experiences. In this sense, phenomenology can become a valuable clinical tool."}, {"Title": "Retrospective study of suicide cases admitted in Nepal Medical College Teaching Hospital.", "Abstract": "A retrospective study of suicide cases admitted to Emergency Department and latter admitted to Department of Medicine and followed by Department of Psychiatry, Nepal Medical College Teaching Hospital.

Using National Comorbidity Survey data from those 609 respondents who had lifetime histories of panic attacks or PD, we tested this prediction. Neither respiratory symptom (smothering; dyspnea) strongly differentiated between respondents with PD and those with only panic attacks. Respiratory symptom endorsement was unrelated to PD when the number of other symptoms endorsed was controlled; furthermore, respiratory symptoms had slight effect sizes and were not included in a multivariate context. In contrast, fear of dying had the largest effect size, an association with PD that persisted after control for other symptom endorsement, and a continuing importance in multivariate analyses. Strikingly, panic attack respondents who reported having had only one panic attack were as likely as PD respondents to report respiratory symptoms during panic. These findings, although based on retrospective self-report and thus subject to recall bias, are inconsistent with the hypothesis that respiratory symptoms during panic have diagnostic significance."}, {"Title": "Trauma and traumatized populations in Israel: the Israel Journal of Psychiatry and Related Sciences, 1963-2002.", "Abstract": "In Europe and the U.S., awareness of interpersonal traumatization has disappeared and reappeared, seemingly connected to socio-historical conditions.

In this country we have only partially emerged from an epidemic of violence that was really an epidemic of youth violence. Thus it is hardly surprising that psychiatrists are being asked more and more frequently whether psychiatric medications might help to diminish the toll from this behavioral plague. Medications are useful and appropriate for only a small minority of the people who commit serious violence. Even when they are indicated, they can never be the sole treatment modality, but should be supplemented by psychological and social therapies. When the violence is a byproduct or symptom of an underlying mental illness, treating that illness is generally the most effective method of preventing future violence on a long-term basis. However, most violence is not committed by those who are mentally ill, and most of the mentally ill never commit a serious act of violence. That is why many attempts have been made to discover whether there are drugs that diminish the symptom, violence, even when there is no underlying mental illness for which drugs would normally be prescribed. In fact there are several, and their indications and use are reviewed here. Different principles govern the acute short-term emergency treatment of a violent crisis and the long-term treatment of those who are chronically and repetitively violent, and these differences are also summarized here."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatric symptoms in general medical hospital units--assessment of the need for psychiatric consultation-liaison in Hungary].", "Abstract": "Psychiatric symptoms and disorders are a serious problem area, absorbing high health service provision capacities. Extensive research work is done internationally relating to the morbidity of psychiatric disorders in general medical departments, but no Hungarian data have been available so far. In the present study, general psychiatric symptoms were detected in Hungarian general hospitals, with special regard to mood disorders.\nA self-assessment-based questionnaire survey was performed, covering 2,444 patients treated in general medical departments. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory. The use of anti-depressants was also checked.\nOn the basis of the questionnaire screening, 46.6% of patients showed a pathological score. Depressive symptoms were found primarily in the departments of chronic diseases. The use of antidepressants showed a very low frequency, in spite of the high prevalence of depressive symptoms. The use of anxiolytics was relatively high in depressive states.\nThe high frequency of mood disorders is not surprising in somatic medicine, but it is mainly found among chronic patients. However, their adequate pharmacotherapy is insufficient. On the basis of these data, the improvement of the consultation-liaison psychiatry is needed."}, {"Title": "Computer-assisted phenotype characterization for genetic research in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric disorders differ from other complex phenotypes in their lack of objectively assessable biological markers that contribute to the establishment of a research diagnosis for genetic studies. To nevertheless allow for the delineation of genetically meaningful diagnostic entities for psychiatric genetic research, comprehensive phenotype characterization procedures are required. It is widely agreed that these should include the standardized assessment of life-time clinical symptomatology, sociodemographic, and environmental factors. Data should be based on several sources, i.e. diagnostic interviews with probands and their relatives as well as a thorough review of medical records, and final assignment of diagnosis should follow robust algorithms (i.e. best-estimate procedures, consensus diagnosis). Here, we outline a practical implementation of such a phenotype characterization strategy, including patient recruitment, study enrolment procedures, comprehensive diagnostic assessment, and data management. We argue that successful psychiatric phenotype characterization requires flexible tools. For this purpose, we have developed a computer-assisted phenotype characterization inventory, built around the backbone of a relational database. It allows for the straightforward assessment of symptoms, automated error checks and diagnostic assignment, easily manageable data storage and handling, and flexible data transfer between various research centers even across language barriers, while at the same time keeping up with the highest standards for the protection of sensitive patient data."}, {"Title": "Did I make the grade? Ethical issues in psychosocial screening of children for adoptive placement.", "Abstract": "This article suggests that psychological evaluations as a \"screen for normalcy\" with a view to adoption are a breach of the child's right to psychological integrity and privacy under international human rights law. A foreseeable outcome of such psychological screens, especially for the older foster child who has experienced multiple placements, is an unreliable mental health diagnosis. Normal, albeit maladaptive, potentially modifiable coping strategies arising in the context of family disruption come after the psychological screen to be labeled as an indicator of mental disorder. This, in turn, may inappropriately interfere with the child's adoption prospects. It is suggested that psychological screens for normalcy of preadoptive children represent a misuse both of psychology and psychiatry for they are motivated more by the needs and interests of social institutions involved in the adoption process rather than those of the child."}, {"Title": "The silence of Socrates.", "Abstract": "This paper emphasizes the humanistic and phenomenologic approach to the mind (soul, self) and contrasts it to the \"era of the brain\" that is so idealized by psychiatry today. It describes the debate between those who expect science to explain everything sooner or later and those who believe there are certain essential aspects of the world, such as the qualia of consciousness, that cannot be reduced to material factors. Plato's dialogue Timaeus is taken as the historically first example of this debate. The connection between it and what has been labeled \"neuroism\" in contemporary psychiatry is established and the relevance of this debate to the practice of psychoanalysis and dynamic psychiatry is discussed.

We examined all 13 etiology models of comorbidity described by Neale and Kendler (American Journal of Genetics, 57, 935-953, 1995) for depression and each of four levels of smoking to shed light on the role that differing definitions might have played in generating the conflicting findings. Data came from 979 young adults aged 26-35 years who participated in an epidemiological cohort study in southeastern Michigan. Respondent and family history data on parental smoking and depression were analyzed using the biometric modeling method for family data, which Rhee and colleagues (Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines, 44, 612-636, 2003; Behavior Genetics, 34, 251-265, 2004) have shown to be valid more frequently than traditional prevalence analyses. Results of the biometric model fitting suggested that for ever smoking, the comorbidity with depression may be related to chance or a high liability threshold for smoking only. In contrast, a correlated liabilities model fit the data best for the comorbidity of depression with daily, heavy, and nicotine-dependent smoking. The familial correlations accounted for 73%-95% of the total variance shared between depression and these levels of smoking. These results differ from analyses of these data using a traditional prevalence approach, which found no evidence of shared familial liability. The conflicting findings of the studies that have examined the relationship between smoking and depression may be attributable to differences in definition of the disorders and the methods used to analyze them."}, {"Title": "[Application of actigraphy in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Altered motor activity is a frequently observed symptom in many psychiatric disorders.

The average age of the examined patients was 20 years. All patients had secondary education. In my work the ACL Gough and Heilbrun Adjectival Test was used which was completed by the examined women three times following the instruction: \"I am\", \"my mother is\", \"my father is\". As a result the actual images of the patients as well as of their mothers and fathers were obtained. The esteem rates were calculated by comparing the number of positive adjectives to the number of negative adjectives used by the patients to evaluate individual persons. The interdependencies between esteem rates and the characteristics of the actual images of these persons were determined based on the r-Pearson correlation.\nThe results obtained indicated the existence of crucial statistic dependencies between the variables analysed and constituted the basis for the formulation of the following conclusions: 1. Patients are characterised by a low self-esteem and a low acceptance level of their parents. They accept their fathers in the smallest degree, compared to that their self-esteem is higher and the acceptance of their mothers is the highest. 2. Self-esteem is related in a significant way to the characteristics of self image such as: sense of responsibility, autonomy, ability to accomplish life objectives and establishing close relationships with other people. 3. The acceptance of their mothers is related to the characteristics typical of them such as: protectiveness, ability to establish and maintain positive interpersonal relationships, empathy and understanding the motives of their own behaviour and those of other people. 4.

From its establishment to March 2004, the WT performed surveys and analyses of the current situation of preliminary reports by psychiatric experts (preliminary reports) and of psychiatric practice in correctional facilities. Based on the results, the WT has presented proposals including guidelines for preliminary reports. In January 2002, the WT conducted an awareness survey on the status quo of testimony by psychiatric experts and forensic psychiatry, targeting the members of the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology, and obtained 666 replies. The survey revealed various critical opinions such as skepticism over the current punishment imposed on criminal patients with mental disorders. In February 2002, the WT obtained data on preliminary reports (2,042 cases) compiled prior to prosecution in FY2000 from the Japanese Ministry of Justice. Reviewing the details and differences between the evaluation by psychiatrists and the decision by public prosecutors, the WT pointed out the ambiguity of criteria used for the evaluation of competency of weak-minded persons and the criteria for criminal punishment. Around the same time, the WT was also asked by a news agency to analyze the preliminary reports of 50 district public prosecutor offices. The results revealed marked regional differences in the operation of the preliminary evaluation system for competency. In January 2003, the WT collected 146 preliminary reports from around the country for comparison and review, and again found conspicuous individual and regional discrepancies in the format and content. Based on these results, the WT conducted a hearing of 41 expert opinions on preliminary reports, and in January 2004, proposed guidelines outlining a format model of preliminary reports, and a training and authorizing system for forensic psychiatrists, to standardize preliminary reports and enhance their reliability. In February 2004, the WT conducted a questionnaire survey on the current situation of psychiatry in correctional facilities, targeting doctors with experience working under these circumstances. Fifty-one replies were obtained. Most of the respondents approved of the current system.

This study aimed to examine whether career intention, especially in the shortage specialties, changes between undergraduate level and graduation. The 234 participants were Senior House Officers and Pre-Registration House Officers, who had provided information about their career intentions in their fourth year of medical school. Participants completed a postal questionnaire about their current career intentions. 38.9% of medical students rising to 63.3% of doctors definitely intended to pursue a particular specialty. While the numbers of people who definitely wanted to pursue general practice and psychiatry increased, in line with nearly all other specialties, the overall attractiveness of these shortage specialties fell.

Improvements in attitudes following undergraduate psychiatric attachment decayed over time but remained higher than pre-attachment levels. Attitudes of doctors who definitely intended to pursue psychiatry, however, increased at each stage. Attitudes of doctors were predicted by post-attachment attitudes, which in turn were predicted by encouragement from consultants and influences of specialist registrars during the attachment at medical school. There were no differences between a problem-based and a traditional psychiatry curriculum in attitude change. The findings suggest that encouragement during medical school from more senior doctors increases the numbers wanting to pursue psychiatry and may increase the number who subsequently pursue psychiatry as a career."}, {"Title": "Principles for development of multi-disciplinary, mental health learning modules for undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing education.", "Abstract": "People experiencing mental health problems have greater contact with health and welfare professionals in generalist settings than with specialist mental health services. Yet the capacity for generalist professionals to respond effectively to mental health problems is often compromised by inadequate mental health training. The Discipline of Psychiatry at the University of Newcastle developed a series of CD-Rom mental health learning modules for professionals working in non-mental health settings. The paper describes the principles that guided the development of a series and how those principles were applied.\nThe following development principles were adopted. The series should: (i) have a multi-disciplinary application; (ii) be adaptable for presentation in multiple educational domains; (iii) be accessible for rural and remote practitioners; (iv) combine structured solutions-focused lessons (directed learning) with elements of problem-based learning; (v) include working problems that are authentic and relevant; and (vi) describe normal, abnormal and cross-cultural manifestations of problems.\nThe model guided the development of a short course series on professional engagement with people who have personality problems. The learning modules provide generic, multi-disciplinary training for a range of practitioners, including nurses, primary care physicians, social workers, psychologists and magistrates. The modules have been adapted for use in undergraduate medical education, postgraduate programs (in population health, nursing, psychology and drug and alcohol studies) and continuing education.\nIn contrast to traditional diagnostic-focussed psychiatry training, the model directly addresses the mental health training needs of health and welfare professionals using a multi-disciplinary, problem-based approach."}, {"Title": "Optimized neuropsychological procedures at different stages of dementia diagnostics.", "Abstract": "To establish a staged procedure in dementia diagnostics and to propose specific, abbreviated test batteries suitable for the three diagnostic stages: Primary medical care, neuro-psychiatry, and memory clinic.\nA total of 159 participants underwent comprehensive clinical, neurological, neuropsychological, and MRI examinations.

Many antidepressant drugs are available with different pharmacological profiles from different classes: tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxydase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). However, there are some limitations with these drugs because there is a long delay before relief for symptoms, some patients with major depression are resistant to treatment, there is a risk to induce manic symptoms in patients with bipolar disorders and these drugs have no effect on the psychotic symptoms frequently associated to major depression. The leading hypothesis for the search of more efficient new antidepressants has been the amine deficit hypothesis: noradrenaline and/or serotonin deficit and more recently dopamine deficit. Moreover, a dopamine deficit has been also hypothesized as the central mechanism explaining the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. These symptoms are the consequence of a deficit of normal behaviours and include affective flattening, alogia, apathy, avolition and social withdrawal. There is thus a great overlap between symptoms of depression and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotics, in contrast with conventional neuroleptics, have been shown to decrease negative symptoms, most probably through the release of dopamine in prefrontal cortex, thus improving psychomotor activity, motivation, pleasure, appetite, etc. The dopamine deficit in cortical prefrontal areas was thus an unifying hypothesis to explain both some symptoms of depression and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Studies in animal confirm this view and show that the association of an atypical antipsychotic drug and an SSRI (olanzapine plus fluoxetine) increases synergistically the release of dopamine in prefrontal areas. Moreover, most of the atypical antipsychotics have a large action spectrum, beyond the only dopamine receptors: their effects on the serotonin receptors--particularly the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors--suggest that their association to SSRI could be a promising treatment for depression. Indeed, SSRI act mainly by increasing the serotonin level in the synapse, thus leading to a non specific activation of all pre- and post-synaptic serotonin receptors. Among them, 5-HT2A/2C receptors have been involved in some of the unwanted effects of SSRI: agitation, anxiety, insomnia, sexual disorders, etc. The inhibition of these receptors could be thus beneficial for patients treated with SSRI. Amisulpride is an unique atypical antipsychotic that selectively blocks dopamine receptors presynaptically in the frontal cortex, possibly enhancing dopaminergic transmission. The antidepressant effect of amisulpride was shown in dysthymia in many clinical studies versus placebo, tricyclic antidepressants, SSRI or others. However, a shorter delay for symptom relief was not demonstrated for amisulpride as compared to comparative antidepressants. Other atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine), which act on a large variety of receptors, have shown antidepressant effects--mainly in association with SSRI--in different psychiatric diseases: treatment-resistant major depression, major depression with psychotic symptoms and depression of bipolar disorders, with no increase of manic symptoms in this latter case. Moreover, the delay for symptom relief was greatly shortened. More comparative double-blind studies are required to confirm and to precise the antidepressant effects of atypical antipsychotics. Nevertheless, these studies suggest that atypical anti-psychotics could be of great value in depressive conditions reputed for their resistance to treatment with usual antidepressants. Particularly, new strategies emerge that combine atypical antipsychotics and antidepressants for greater efficacy and more rapid relief of depression symptoms."}, {"Title": "Evidence-based ethics for neurology and psychiatry research.", "Abstract": "American bioethics, historically arising out of theology and philosophy, has been dominated by the method of normative analysis.

We focus on the relationship between these instruments and the concept of competence, represented in the following elements: context in which an instrument is developed, disclosure of information, standards to assess decision-making capacity, the scale or threshold model, and validity and reliability.\nThe developmental context influences how information is provided and standards defined. Although it is not clear how decision-making capacity relates to competency judgments, most instruments provide good reliability.\nComparison of the different instruments opens directions for future research. Although instruments can never replace a physician's judgment, they may provide a clear starting point for a discussion on competence. In daily practice assessments, attention should be given to information disclosure, the influence of our own normative values in evaluating standards of decision-making capacity, and the relation between decision-making capacity and competence."}, {"Title": "Management of violent behaviour in acutely relapsed schizophrenics.", "Abstract": "The management of aggressive behaviour has always been a critical issue in psychiatry. Finding measures that can be used to accurately predict the likelihood of assaultative behaviour and thus ensure timeous appropriate pharmacological management remains a dilemma. The study objective was to investigate the naturalistic, pharmacological management of inpatient aggressive behaviour in a group of 50 schizophrenic subjects with a view to determine: (1) whether a presenting history of recent violence lead to altered pharmacological management and (2) whether the NOSIE could be regarded as a useful assessment tool with regards to inpatient behaviour management. No significant difference could be demonstrated between the 2 subsets of subjects (history of violence vs none) with respect to total doses of medication administered. No statistical correlation could be found between the total NOSIE score and the dose of psychotropic medication used. The relationship between a subset of NOSIE-items and the total dose of medication was more complex and a clear linear relationship could be demonstrated for a total score of 0 to 5. In this particular ward setting a presenting history of recent violent behaviour did not influence the administration of medication and neither could the clinical judgement employed by the nursing staff to manage inpatient behaviour be captured by the NOSIE. However, a five-item subset of the NOSIE with questions relating to aggression and irritability warrants further scrutiny in this regard."}, {"Title": "Managing suicides via videoconferencing in a remote northern community in Canada.", "Abstract": "Telehealth in remote communities has been reported to be cost-effective for emergency medicine and possibly for psychiatry.\nThe cost of sending a patient out of a remote community for suicide assessment was compared with the cost of maintenance and on-line charges of videoconference.

Coming from a background in community and public psychiatry, I have always considered civil commitment to be the most important forensic mental health statute, as the commitment process in any state greatly influences the lives of many severely mentally ill individuals. Over the course of the past 35 years, many changes have occurred in civil commitment law, resulting in the gradual de-emphasis of the importance of these statutes. The ability of clinicians to use these statutes effectively has diminished. Herein, I review some of the areas of conceptual and practical problems related to the use of these statutes and, in effect, make a plea for a re-examination of the importance of civil commitment and for an attempt to fix some of the problems that have led to the loss of effective and rational civil commitment laws."}, {"Title": "Focus on levomepromazine.", "Abstract": "This is a review of the uses of levomepromazine in psychiatry, based upon MEDLINE, PSYCLIT and EMBASE literature searches.

The results showed that neither the allelic distribution nor the major haplotype distribution (except for a rare haplotype) of five SNPs in patients was significantly different from that in controls. A further family-based association study (229 family trios) of G861C allele suggested that HTR1B was not a susceptible gene with schizophrenia in our sample.

Clinical symptoms were evaluated using the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS) before and after 8 weeks of treatment with 300-600 mg/day of chlorpromazine. Our results show that genotyping -141C Ins/Del may help to predict the efficacy of chlorpromazine treatment (P=0.01) due to the fact that patients with no Del allele showed greater improvement than those with Del allele on the overall BPRS (P=0.03), and that, therefore, the potential for therapy in patients with schizophrenia is related to the -141C Ins/Del polymorphism in the DRD2 gene.

A pilot study evaluated whether or not PCPs needed such a consultation service, whether or not it assisted them in providing care, and their overall satisfaction with the service. PCPs were informed on how to request a consultation. Data were collected from patients (demographics), PCPs (satisfaction with preexisting consultation availability and quality, PACT Net consultation reason, preferred mode of contact, duration, and, satisfaction), and specialists (ease, quality of request, and satisfaction). Satisfaction was measured prospectively using a 7-point Likert scale. Data were collected on 30 consultations, 28 by telephone and 2 by e-mail; other data were by combined methods. The average duration of consultation was 47 minutes, and 24 responses occurred within one business day. The top three services requested for consultation were psychiatry (e.g., management of behavioral disturbance), medical genetics (diagnosis), and gastroenterology (miscellaneous). PCPs rated baseline satisfaction with: (1) pre-existing local services at 3.37, (2) timeliness of the PACT Net consultation at 5.45, (3) quality of the communication at 6.3, and (4) overall quality and utility of the consultation at 6.2.

In the following article, I provide some additional first-hand information about controversies in which David Healy was involved. I then situate these controversies within the context of the increasing commercialization of medical research. I discuss how the controversies highlight the failure of existing regulatory regimes in curbing inappropriate industry influence over research.

A historical account of therapeutic inoculation of malaria parasites in Italian psychiatric clinics].", "Abstract": "For more than thirty years, from the early Twenties to the late Fifties, the inoculation of malaria parasites was the therapeutic treatment preferred by Western psychiatrists and neurologists for several clinical forms of tertiary syphilis, especially general paresis. During those decades, tens of thousands of people, mainly paretics but also schizophrenic patients, were intentionally infected with the human malaria parasites. In this paper we present the result of a bibliographic survey of the practice of malariatherapy in Italy. We analyzed the seven main Italian neurology and psychiatry journal from 1920 to the 1960. Moreover, we collected malariological bibliography concerning malariatherapy, and all the books on malariatherapy and chapter on this topic contained in any neurology and psychiatry textbooks published in Italy during the same period. We found 91 papers in the psychiatry journals. Most of these papers were concentrated between 1926 and the end of the Thirties; the main subject consisted of clinical-statistical information, but several papers concerned serological or anatomical alteration associated to the evolution of the disease and the therapy, and the mechanisms of action. Most articles discussed the criteria for defining recovery from general paresis obtained through malariatherapy. This historical and bibliographic review shows that malariatheapy was immediately accepted among Italian psychiatrists because of the strong relationship with Austrian and German psychiatric culture. The spread of the treatment was concentrated in the North and Center of Italy, and was administrated mainly in public psychiatric hospitals and university neurological clinics. Malariatherapy is a very interesting and fascinating subject the history of the interdisciplinary aspects related to the use of malariatherapy in psychiatry and malariology makes.

Therefore, the need arises for mental health services research to assess this process cross-nationally in a standardised and systematic way. Such research approaches should seek to maximise the generalisability of results from high-quality (e.g. randomised controlled) single- or multi-site trials assessing specific models of day hospital care.\nUsing a self-developed structured questionnaire, the European Day Hospital Evaluation (EDEN) study group carried out national surveys of the characteristics of day hospitals for general psychiatric patients in Germany, England, Poland, the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic, during the period 2001--2002.\nResponse rates varied from 52 to 91 %. Findings show that day hospitals have no consistent profile of structural and procedural features. Similarities across countries focus on three main issues: on average, consideration of concepts oriented toward providing acute treatment are equivalent; disorders associated with disabled functioning in everyday life, high risk of somatic complications, and need for behaviour control are excluded to a comparable degree; and some core therapeutic activities are consistent with the main approaches of social psychiatry. Identified according to self-rated conceptions and extended with data from individual hospital's statistics on the clientele in 2000, three clusters of limited selectivity subdivide the services. One category focuses mainly on rehabilitative tasks; two categories are oriented toward providing acute treatment as an alternative to inpatient care, but combine this either with rehabilitative tasks or with equal additional functions of shortening inpatient treatment and providing psychotherapy. The distribution of services across these three clusters varies significantly in the five European countries.\nFuture day hospital studies should always clarify the type of services being assessed. To fully consider the impact of their results, the current national and international health policy environment of these services should be taken into account.

On the one hand it has to be admitted that the operationalisation of competence in terms of value-free categories, e.g. rational decision abilities, guarantees objectivity to a great extent; but on the other hand it bears severe problems. Firstly, the cognitive focus is in itself a normative convention in the process of anthropological value-attribution. Secondly, it misses the complexity of the decision process in real life. It is therefore suggested that values, emotions and other biographic and context specific aspects should be considered when interpreting the cognitive standards according to the MacArthur model. To fill the gap between cognitive and non-cognitive approaches the phenomenological theory of personal constructs is briefly introduced. In conclusion some main demands for further research to develop a multi-step model of competence assessment are outlined."}, {"Title": "The concept of alternative strategies and its relevance to psychiatry and clinical psychology.", "Abstract": "The intent of this article is to introduce the evolutionary concept of alternative strategies into the fields of psychiatry and clinical psychology. In behavioral ecology, the term alternative strategies refers to the presence of two or more discrete behavioral variants among adults of one sex and one population when those variants serve the same functional end. Often discrete behavioral variants are associated with specific morphological, physiological, and life-history characters. The concept of alternative strategies has been applied to human behavior to explain the origin of some behavioral syndromes that are currently classified as mental disorders or emotional dysfunctions. Antisocial personality could represent a high-risk strategy of social defection associated with resource acquisition and reproduction. Insecure attachment could represent an evolved psychological mechanism that used the quality of parental care received during childhood as a cue for optimizing adult reproductive strategies. Since a major contribution of evolutionary theory is the insight that individual differences are core biological features of any animal species, including Homo sapiens, the application of the concept of alternative strategies to psychiatry and clinical psychology can be a powerful antidote to the growing tendency to medicalize human diversity."}, {"Title": "[Physiological approach to peripheral neuropathy. Conventional nerve conduction studies and magnetic motor root stimulation].", "Abstract": "In this communication, I first show some points we should mind in the conventional peripheral nerve conduction studies and later present clinical usefulness of motor root stimulation for peripheral neuropathy. CONVENTIONAL NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES (NCS): The most important point revealed by the conventional NCSs is whether neuropathy is due to axonal degeneration or demyelinating process. Precise clinical examination with this neurophysiological information leads us to a diagnosis and treatment. Poor clinical examination makes these findings useless. Long standing axonal degeneration sometimes induces secondary demyelination at the most distal part of involved nerves. On the other hand, severe segmental demyelination often provokes secondary axonal degeneration at distal parts to the site of demyelination. These secondary changes show the same abnormal neurophysiological findings as those of the primary involvement. We should be careful of this possibility when interpreting the results of NCS. NCS of sensory nerves is not good at revealing demyelinating process. Mild temporal dispersion of potentials often reduces an amplitude of SNAP or loss of responses, which usually suggests axonal degeneration, because of short duration of sensory nerve potentials. MOTOR ROOT STIMULATION IN PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY: Magnetic stimulation with a coil placed over the spine activates motor roots and evokes EMG responses from upper and lower limb muscles. The site of activation with this method was determined to be where the motor roots exit from the spinal canal (intervertebral foramina) (J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 52 (9): 1025-1032, 1989) because induced currents are very dense at such a foramen made by electric resistant bones. In several kinds of peripheral neuropathy, this method has been used to detect a lesion at a proximal part of the peripheral nerves which can not be detected by the conventional NCSs. I present a few cases in whom motor root stimulation had a clinical merit. In a patient with neuralgic amyotrophy, motor root stimulation disclosed a conduction block between the cervical intervertebral foramen and brachial plexus which was not detected by conventional NCSs. Motor root stimulation clearly revealed demyelination in a patient with CIDP in whom sural nerve biopsy findings suggested axonal degeneration, that must be secondary to demyelination. In a patient with tomacular neuropathy, magnetic stimulation revealed conduction delay in the spinal nerve within the spinal canal (Clin Neurol (Jap), 28: 447-452, 1988). Based on the above results, combination of NCSs and magnetic motor root stimulation must brush up the neurophysiological approach to peripheral neuropathy."}, {"Title": "Behavioral health care of isolated military personnel by videoconference.", "Abstract": "The changing role of the military presents a unique challenge for military behavioral health organizations in dealing with the geographic isolation of personnel. Telemedical solutions should help to meet this challenge. In the behavioral health arena, there are many uses for videoconferencing and other communications technology in maintaining continuity when patients or clinicians travel or deploy; assisting isolated behavioral health-care providers and general practitioners; evaluating and treating isolated military personnel; and addressing family issues. Family interventions by videoconference and other communications technology may be particularly useful in treating military personnel and in promoting morale of the fighting force. Although much remains to be researched and proven empirically, anecdotal experience supports the utility of using communications technology to enhance behavioral health interventions. This article describes the clinical videoconference experience within the Department of Psychiatry at Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC), during a Multinational force deployment to the Sinai, and during training at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, Louisiana.

The analysis shows that HEINROTH took up this post because of financial needs. Hence there arose a conflict between this job at the city's orphanage and madhouse and HEINROTH's real ambition of becoming a professor of psychiatry at Leipzig University. THis continued for the whole of his time there. HEINROTH undertook an extremely responsible role and worked energetically at St George's from 1814 until 1834; almost the entire medical care of the 600 inmate lay in his hands. HEINROTH cannot be held responsible for the failure to reform the mental health care system, though urgently needed. On the contrary, he made every effort to ease his patients' mental anguish and life at St George's. However, it must be pointed out that HEINROTH entrusted to his assistants a great part of his duties. HEINROTH did not always fulfil his duties at the local prison to the agreed extent. Increased tensions between him and authorities led to mutual recriminations which ultimately resulted in HEINROTH's dismissal at Christmas 1833.

A 200 year old tradition].", "Abstract": "The University of Leipzig boasts a long tradition in the field of psychiatry. In 1811 Johann Christian August Heinroth was appointed as the first professor of mental health (\"psychic therapy\") in Europe. He conceived mental illness as based on a person's own guilt, as the consequence of turning away from God and living a life untrue to Christian ethics. After Heinroth retired in 1843 the Leipzig chair remained vacant until 1878 brain researcher Paul Flechsig succeeded him as professor of psychiatry, although not significantly contributing to the progress of this subject. His first assistant was Emil Kraepelin. Flechsig's successors, Oswald Bumke and Paul Schroder, included psychological as well as sociogenetic topics in their research. The latter did pioneering work for the institutionalization of child and adolescent psychiatry. The history of Leipzig psychiatry during the Nazi years has not yet been researched in depth. So far, however, no evidence has been found to prove the university hospital's involvement in German psychiatry's excruciating crimes on patients. It is true, however, that as elsewhere doctors of the Leipzig hospital were members of the Courts of Hereditary Health (Erbgesundheitsgericht) and that e.g. August Bostroem knew of the homicides. In 1943, during the directorship of Werner Wagner, the hospital was totally destroyed. Its reconstruction was mainly the work of Richard Arwed Pfeifer, who also made remarkable contributions to the study of the angiostructure of the brain. With Dietfried Muller-Hegemann, who had a major influence of East-German psychotherapy, the social psychiatric era began, and it was successfully continued under Berhard Schwarz, Klaus Weise and the hospital's present head, Matthias C. Angermeyer, Weise's theoretical and philosophical achievements in the foundation and his demand for an empirical verification of social psychiatric ideas in the whole of Germany are acknowledged until the present day.

The HCR-20 was significantly related to the AQ: the historical factor was strongly correlated to the AQ Physical Aggression factor and to the Anger factor. As regards to the HCR-20 relations with offenses, its Historical factor was related to both violent (assault and battery, robbery) and non-violent offenses (drug offenses, theft).

They have emphasized the pathophysiological role of serotonin (5-HT) in affective disorders. Indeed, SSRIs were developed for inhibition of the neuronal uptake for serotonin (5-HT), a property shared with the TCAs (tricyclic anti-depressants), but without affecting the other various central neuroreceptors (ie, histamine, acetylcholine and adrenergic receptors) that are responsible for many of the safety and tolerability problems with TCAs. In this way, fluoxetine and other SSRIs represent a major advance over tricyclics, because of their lower toxicity. While the position of fluoxetine relative to other selective serotoninergic antidepressants requires further investigation, fluoxetine has a more favorable tolerability profile for a similar efficacy in comparison to tricyclic antidepressants. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of fluoxetine are well described. After oral administration, fluoxetine is almost completely absorbed. Due to hepatic first-pass metabolism, the oral bioavailability is < 90%. Fluoxetine has a half-life of 2-7 days, whereas the half-life of norfluoxetine ranges between 4 and 15 days. This long half-life of fluoxetine may be advantageous when the patient omits a dose since drug concentrations decrease slightly. On the other hand, in the case of fluoxetine non-response, long washout periods are necessary before switching the patient to a TCA or a MAO inhibitor to avoid drug interactions or the development of a 5-HT syndrome. As a class, SSRIs are considerably more selective in comparison to TCAs in terms of their central nervous system mechanisms, but differ in other clinically relevant aspects. This action affects several specific 5-HT receptors, which, in turn, effects a multitude of neural systems and signalization pathways. However, despite the facilitating serotoninergic neurotransmission, the direct mechanism by which a SSRI exerts its anti-depressant activity remains uncertain. The therapeutic response in major depression for SSRIs (ie 15-20 days) maybe due to a progressive desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT autoreceptors in the midbrain raphe nucleus. On the other hand, it has also been postulated that 5-HT is a modulator of several neurophysiological pathways, including dopamine, noradrenaline, but also neurotrophic factors, intra-cytoplasmic phosphorylations and nuclear genes expression. Therapeutic activity of SSRIs may finally results in a complex modulation and homeostasis between monoaminergic neurotransmisson and neuronal plasticity. In term of health-care, the introduction of fluoxetine and other SSRIs in the 1980s has radically changed the treatment of depressive disorder worldwide and they have emerged as the first line of treatment for depressive disorders. The efficacy of fluoxetine is now well established in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Indeed, this efficacy has been assessed in numerous clinical controlled trials involving patients with major depressive disorders. Meta-analysis were carried out and confirmed that fluoxetine was as effective as the tricyclic antidepressants, and appeared more effective than placebo in improving the symptoms of depression. However, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that any one SSRI is more effective than another, but not all patients respond to the same agent. Looking to the future, we need further comparative studies of the SSRIs with the next generation of antidepressants such as 5-HT noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, Venlafaxine). Actually, it is interesting to note that, whereas the emphasis with the SSRIs has been on their selectivity, recent developments have tended to move towards less selective agents, and now to other neurobiological pathways (ie neurotrophic factors). Finally, fluoxetine, in common with other SSRIs, remains today a first-line treatment option for major depressive disorder."}, {"Title": "[Evaluation of typical psychopathic traits with juvenile offenders].", "Abstract": "The concept of psychopathy has received many definitions for the first days of psychiatry. Recently, the Hare's Psychopathy Check List Revised has been created. This scale has the advantage to investigate the classically characteristic traits of the syndrome (need of stimulation, lack of culpability, superficial activity, lack of empathy, impassivity) and to point out the early development of behavior disturbances. In the American classification (DSM IV), oppositional and aggressive behavior in child and adolescent is grouped under the Conduct Disorder diagnostic criteria. This trouble appears to be a strong predictive factor of psychopathy in adult. Identifying the high risk factors of evolution to psychopathic personality would allow an earlier intervention and prevention by multisystemic interventions for example. The present study aims to evaluate in what measure characteristic traits of psychopathy in adults are present in severe juvenile offenders and to point out, in a second time, the differences between adolescents meeting the DSM IV criteria for Conduct Disorder and a control population by a dimensional personality inventory.\nThe sample consists in 47 severe juvenile offenders referred for at least 3 months by a Youth Court to a Public Institution for Youth Protection (Belgium, Wauthier-Braine, 1999-2001), who have given an oral contentment and completely fulfilled the Temperament and Character Inventory-TCI. We have collected data about: schooling year by year, number of fails, changes of school; antecedents of oppositional defiant disorder with provocation (ODD, DSM IV criteria); antecedent of Conduct Disorder (CD, DSM IV criteria); penal antecedents (Youth Judge, works of general interest, placements); medico-psychological antecedents (consultation to a psychologist or a psychiatrist, hospitalization, illness, surgical intervention); psychoactive drug use or abuse. We used the TCI--Temperament and Character Inventory. This is a dimensional personality inventory. Based on biological, genetic and clinical hypothesis, it describes 2 types of variables defining personality: Variables of temperament (genetically transmitted and biologically controlled), and Variables of character (learned part of the personality reflecting the degree of adaptation and maturity, varying with environment through development). We have chosen this tool because of its dimensional aspect. Adolescence being a time of psychological and personality changes, such a tool is more useful than a categorical one. We also used this tool to verify the existence of the specific triad described by Cloninger and Svrakic. According to these authors, psychopathic personality in adult is characterized by a specific triad in which novelty seeking is high while harm avoidance and reward dependence are low. These observations are highly correlated to Hare's definition of psychopathy. We give the principal scores for the 7 personality dimensions expressed in global scores (total of the items for each dimension) and pondered ones (global scores divided by the number of items of the dimension x 100).\nStatistical analysis was performed with the Stateview 5.0 t-test program for data analysis. Statistical results show the absence of a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for TCI 1, 4.5 and 7 but a statistically significant difference for TCI 2, 3 and 6 (p <.0001).\nThe first limitation of our study is linked to the sample composed of young adolescents placed in an Institution for Youth Protection who doesn't reflect the whole population of offenders. A second limitation is correlated to the randomization system: randomization for age but not for sex, ethnical and cultural origin and socioeconomic status. Our results with adolescent offenders don't completely meet the Cloninger's psychopathy triad in adults. Moreover, in literature data, aggressive behavior is correlated to high novelty seeking and associated with low harm avoidance, reward dependence and persistence in children, these items are predictive of antisocial behavior in teenage and young adulthood. In our sample where antisocial behaviors are severe, we should be expecting a high novelty seeking but that is not the case. Our results should be explained by the fact that adolescence in itself is a more powerful factor of high novelty seeking than psychopathic trait. Harm avoidance and reward dependence seem to be a real problem in offending population and reflect aggressive behaviors in adolescents (lack of harm perception, sensitivity and empathy). Another interesting element is the cooperation factor that is significantly lower in the study group. This seems to comfort the hypothesis of a lower social maturity in institutionalized adolescents.\nRegarding to a control group subjects from 15 to 25 years old, adolescent offenders observed in an Institution for Youth Protection show a significantly different profile in the TCI for Harm Avoidance, Reward Dependence and Cooperation. Regarding to adult psychopaths, adolescent offenders partially meet the classical diagnostic triad of psychopathy, what should be indicating that such adolescents already show emotional perturbations: lower harm avoidance, reward dependence and cooperation than control population. This third factor is not characteristic of psychopathy but reflects relational difficulties, which are important in adolescent offenders. So, our study point out the complex psychopathology of adolescent offenders and the coexistence in such adolescents of attachment disorder and the difficulty to treat them because of their multiple lacks (cognitive, psychopathological, familial and scholar). We think important to discuss the necessity of approaches based on the development of personal creative abilities and involving all the professionals concerned in the young's universe.

Among the respondents, 65 persons were specialists in psychiatry, 32% of whom would not consider using ECT even if they were in a psychotic depressive state. According to the bias factor, which has been calculated based on the answers to the 11 questions regarding attitudes, those psychiatrists who worked in inpatient care showed a less negative attitude. Among the items concerning knowledge of ECT, incorrect answers were most frequent to questions about myocardial infarction as a contraindication, and about the identity of the person who had pioneered this treatment. The negative attitude of Hungarian psychiatrists, especially of those who work in outpatient care, may have an important role in the decrease of the application of ECT in the past decade in Hungary."}, {"Title": "State propaganda and mental disorders: the issue of psychiatric casualties among Japanese soldiers during the Asia-Pacific War.", "Abstract": "This article explores the politics of Japanese wartime medical policy, demonstrating how state propaganda about the people and their armed forces influenced authoritative views on health and what might endanger it. By focusing on the obstacles faced by psychiatrists trying to promote more official concern for mental health issues, it challenges the validity of figures indicating a low incidence of psychological trauma among the country's soldiers. Civilian psychiatrists had to contend with the threat of censorship and arrest for even discussing war-induced mental disorders; at the same time, army psychiatrists as military insiders were pressured to convince their patients that their conditions were not serious and did not merit compensation. While discussing the neglected topic of Japanese psychiatric casualties, an attempt is made to provide a comparative approach by referring to the state of military psychiatry in other national settings."}, {"Title": "An analysis of the effect of funding source in randomized clinical trials of second generation antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The effect of funding source on the outcome of randomized controlled trials has been investigated in several medical disciplines; however, psychiatry has been largely excluded from such analyses. In this article, randomized controlled trials of second generation antipsychotics in schizophrenia are reviewed and analyzed with respect to funding source (industry vs. non-industry funding).\nA literature search was conducted for randomized, double-blind trials in which at least one of the tested treatments was a second generation antipsychotic. In each study, design quality and study outcome were assessed quantitatively according to rating scales. Mean quality and outcome scores were compared in the industry-funded studies and non-industry-funded studies. An analysis of the primary author's affiliation with industry was similarly performed.\nResults of industry-funded studies significantly favored second generation over first generation antipsychotics when compared to non-industry-funded studies. Non-industry-funded studies showed a trend toward higher quality than industry-funded studies; however, the difference between the two was not significant. Also, within the industry-funded studies, outcomes of trials involving first authors employed by industry sponsors demonstrated a trend toward second generation over first generation antipsychotics to a greater degree than did trials involving first authors employed outside the industry (p=0.05).\nWhile the retrospective design of the study limits the strength of the findings, the data suggest that industry bias may occur in randomized controlled trials in schizophrenia. There appears to be several sources by which bias may enter clinical research, including trial design, control of data analysis and multiplicity/redundancy of trials."}, {"Title": "Screening for domestic violence: practice patterns, knowledge, and attitudes of physicians in Arizona.", "Abstract": "Victims of domestic violence presenting for health care are frequently referred to medical specialists, but little is known about domestic violence screening among specialists.

The changing doctor-patient-relationship, the growing influence of user groups and consumer associations, the new model of patients as responsible partners and last not least the increasing financial pressure have resulted in patients being more often and more intensively involved in treatment decisions. This development has influenced psychiatry in general and psychiatric research. Concepts like quality of life and consumer satisfaction were taken up in Germany as well and have stimulated a lot of empirical studies. In addition to traditionally used outcome criteria like severity of disease and symptomatology so called subjective outcome criteria are more and more often applied. Using seven simple questions - why, what for, who, what, in what way, where, when - some general aspects concerning surveys of patient surveys are discussed. Some relevant results are outlined and the actual situation is evaluated. In general the described results of patient surveys refer to patients in hospitals. This can be explained by the structure of our health care system and by the fact that substantial research resources are generally linked to the inpatient sector. Results of inpatient surveys cannot be generalized to outpatients and users of complementary services. In the next years social psychiatric research should bring stronger focus to the subjective perspectives of these patients."}, {"Title": "[Changes in the provision of psychiatric services at a psychiatric district hospital].", "Abstract": "Changes in the provision of psychiatric services within the last decennials are probably best understood if the impact of national socialism on clinical psychiatry is regarded. Many psychiatrists took part in the \"Aktion T4\" the organised killing of their patients, at least they did not resist campaigns directed to killing or sterilisation patients. After WW II, a period of silence and acceptance of inhuman circumstances in the large mental state hospitals appeared, when in the sixties a new generation of psychiatrists was no longer willing to continue the traditional system of mental health care delivery. The Expert Commission on Mental Health Care reported a comprehensive agenda on reformation of service delivery in 1975, which was influential in the development of alternative structures of psychiatric services. Most mental state hospitals reduced their capacities and parallel to this process smaller units, devoted to principles of community psychiatry, associated to general hospitals were created. Overall, the number of hospital driven beds decreased at about 33 %, but in the large hospitals at two thirds within the last 25 years in Baden-Wurttemberg. This process of deinstitutionalization was accompanied by the development of structures for community care, internal reorganization and modernization, and important steps in budget development, which lead to better treatment opportunities for all kinds of psychiatric institutions. The concrete and historical reality of these circumstances and changes, and possible future directions are exemplified for the psychiatric hospital in Weinsberg."}, {"Title": "[Job integration as a goal of psychiatric therapy].", "Abstract": "The social implications and long term consequences of mental disorders regarding sick days at work, unemployment rates and early retirement are considerable. Outcome in psychiatric treatment should be measured not only by reduction of psychopathological symptoms and improvement of subjective well-being respectively quality of life but also by taking social integration into account. Job inclusion could become a crucial factor indicating successful therapy. It is remarkable that there has been so little focus on the links between reduction of psychopathological symptoms and competitive working skills. Hardly any studies exist evaluating for example psychopharmacological strategies referring to social outcome criteria. Without denying the progress that has been made, the classical paradigm of community psychiatry has reached its limits. Initial hopes of spontaneous social integration did not come true. Vocational rehabililitation sensu strictu is either aiming at the individual's work related skills (personal approach) or at reducing demands on the job (environmental approach) - in Germany being mostly realised at sheltered workshops. Thus most of the rehabilitation programmes are based on the traditional \"train and place\"-approach. There are some controlled studies about the new innovative supported employment programmes taking the reverse principle of \"place and train\" into account. These studies could show a clear superiority regarding the number of successfully integrated patients. Scientific evaluation of complex programmes is sophisticated but seems to be necessary for further developments in the field of general psychiatric therapies as well as for the legitimation of financial ressources needed. Foreseeing the perspective of social psychiatry a next substantial step could be the identification of social and functional outcome variables as a basis of validation of numerous therapy strategies."}, {"Title": "[Social psychiatry and schizophrenia--changes and perspectives].", "Abstract": "There will be an enormous change for general as well as social psychiatry in the next decade. With regard to schizophrenia it is apparent that only innovative research strategies and practical care together may be able to improve the clinical outcome of these disabled persons in the long term. Definitely, a modern social psychiatry does need a better understanding of different aspects of schizophrenia, which includes comprehensive knowledge about its ethiological genetic- and cognitive-based hypotheses as well as awareness of modern drug strategies and effective rehabilitation programs. Alike health economic aspects will reform social psychiatry as its own concepts have to prove their efficacy not only from a therapeutical view but also with respect to its short-, middle- and long-term cost effectiveness."}, {"Title": "Lithium treatment inhibits renal GSK-3 activity and promotes cyclooxygenase 2-dependent polyuria.", "Abstract": "The use of LiCl in clinical psychiatry is routinely complicated by overt nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), the mechanism of which is incompletely understood. In vitro studies indicate that lithium can induce renal medullary interstitial cell cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) protein expression via inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). Both COX1 and COX2 are expressed in the kidney. Renal prostaglandins have been suggested to play an important role in lithium-induced polyuria. The present studies examined whether induction of the COX2 isoform contributes to LiCl-induced polyuria. Four days after initiation of lithium treatment in C57 BL/6J mice, urine volume increased in LiCl-treated mice by fourfold compared with controls (P < 0.0001) and was accompanied by decreased urine osmolality. This was temporally associated with increased renal COX2 protein expression and increased urinary PGE(2) excretion, whereas COX1 levels remained unchanged. COX2 inhibition significantly blunted lithium-induced polyuria (P < 0.0001) and reduced urinary PGE(2) levels. Lithium-associated polyuria was also seen in COX1-/- mice and was associated with increased urinary PGE(2). COX2 inhibition completely prevented polyuria and PGE(2) excretion in COX1-/- mice, suggesting that COX2, but not COX1, plays a critical role in lithium-induced polyuria. Lithium also induced renal medullary COX2 protein expression in congenitally polyuric antidiuretic hormone (AHD)-deficient rats, demonstrating that lithium-induced COX2 protein expression is not secondary to altered ADH levels or polyuria. Lithium also decreased renal medullary GSK-3beta activity, and this was temporally related to increased COX2 expression in the kidney from lithium-treated mice, consistent with a tonic in vivo suppression of COX2 expression by GSK-3 activity. In conclusion, these findings temporally link decreased GSK-3 activity to enhanced renal COX2 expression and COX2-derived urine PGE(2) excretion. Suppression of COX2-derived PGE(2) blunts lithium-associated polyuria."}, {"Title": "Elements of dynamics IV: neuronal metaphors--probing neurobiology for psychodynamic meaning.", "Abstract": "The essentiality of neuronal connections can be seen by the frenetic activity which dissociated neurons in culture exhibit in an attempt to re-establish functional connections. Through these interactions, neurons gain access to trophic factors, such as nerve growth factor, which determine whether they live or die. Connection and successful interaction with others is thus a biological imperative for neurons. The properties of a given neuron are determined both by the inherent genetic program and by changes in its genetic expression induced by cell-to-cell interaction. In other words, plasticity of neuronal function reflects not only cellular properties but is a consequence of its relationships. Since it is reasonable to assume that the emotional experience of organisms derives from the biological properties of their brain cells, it seems fruitful to probe the basic biology of these cells for metaphors that might yield insight into psychological properties. Clinical examples illustrate how using these concepts can enlighten the processes by which psychotherapeutic change can occur. In addition, perhaps understanding the underlying neurobiology can add scientific legitimacy to clinical psychodynamic work, and can reduce the tension between \"biological\" and \"psychological\" psychiatry. These ideas might be used to develop a new framework to strengthen the teaching of psychotherapy."}, {"Title": "The role of stimulants in the treatment of preschool children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "The symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can have an early onset, beginning before the age of 6 years. Despite the significant number of preschool-aged children that can be diagnosed with ADHD, there are limited controlled data available on the pharmacological interventions being increasingly used in this population. A 1990 review showed that 34% of paediatricians and 15% of family physicians had prescribed psychostimulant medications to preschoolers with ADHD, and pharmacoepidemiological studies indicate growing use of stimulants in preschoolers during the 1990s. Unfortunately, only six controlled trials, with a total enrollment of less than 200 children, have been conducted using these drugs in preschoolers. While these small studies provide some evidence of benefit from the use of methylphenidate in preschoolers with ADHD, more data are critically needed. Practice parameters developed by the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry and the American Academy of Pediatrics provide some guidance regarding the diagnosis and treatment of young children with ADHD, but are mainly based upon research in children of primary-school age. The ongoing PATS (Preschool ADHD Treatment Study), funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, will provide important clinical guidance for diagnostic considerations and intervention strategies for children with ADHD aged 3-5 years. Pending the release of data from the PATS study, clinicians must rely on developmental assessment skills, available standardised rating instruments, reports about the child from multiple informants, and knowledge of the risks and benefits of available pharmacological and behavioural treatments, in order to treat preschool children with ADHD effectively."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry, moral worry, and the moral emotions.", "Abstract": "There has been increased philosophical, psychological, and, more recently, psychiatric interest in the moral emotions, most specifically the emotions of guilt, shame, regret, and remorse. Interest in these emotions has not been in their role as symptoms of a particular mental illness, but in their presence in everyday life and in their importance in defining our character and our very humanity. Moral emotions are those emotions that arise in the context of life experiences and daily choices that bear upon our perceptions of the rightness or wrongness of particular actions or inactions. Human beings have a moral scanner that constantly provides both a cognitive judgment and a feeling tone of ease or unease in the moral evaluation of life's moment-to-moment activities. This paper discusses the intersection of psychiatry and the moral emotions, providing case examples and a review of empirical studies to illustrate the relevance of patients' concerns about their moral choices to psychiatric evaluation and practice."}, {"Title": "Ethical issues in psychiatric genetics.", "Abstract": "As knowledge grows regarding the genetic bases of psychiatric disorders, a variety of ethical issues will need to be confronted. Current evidence suggests that the etiology of most psychiatric disorders rests on a combination of multiple genes and environmental factors. As tests for the genes involved become more easily available, pressures will arise to use them for prenatal testing, screening of children and adults, selection of potential adoptees, and pre-marital screening. Common problems that will need to be addressed include popular misunderstanding of the consequences of possessing an affected allele, impact of knowledge of one's genetic make-up on one's sense of self, and the discriminatory use of genetic information to deny persons access to insurance and employment. Although most states have some legislation aimed at preventing discrimination, the laws' coverage is spotty and federal rules are lacking. Physicians may find that newly available genetic information creates new duties for them, including warning third parties who may share the patient's genetic endowment. And genetics research itself has raised questions about when to disclose information to subjects and their family members about the genes that are being studied, and how to define the subjects of the research when information is collected about family members other than the proband. Knowledge of these dilemmas is a first step to resolving them, something that the medical profession will need to attend to in the near-term. Neglect will lead others to set the rules that will control medical practice, including the practice of psychiatry, in the new world of genetic medicine."}, {"Title": "Demonstration of portfolios to assess competency of residents.", "Abstract": "Residency educators are identifying approaches to measure resident competence.

Using guidelines, 18 residents assembled portfolios containing five entries chosen from 13 skills. Trained raters scored the portfolios. Residents and faculty were interviewed about their perceptions. Generalizability results indicated five entries and two raters were sufficient for relative decisions. Six entries or a third rater would be sufficient for absolute decisions. Portfolio scores tended to improve with years of training and correlated with psychiatric knowledge but not clinical performance. Residents and faculty identified benefits to assembling a portfolio. Portfolios incorporate tasks embedded in the residency to provide evidence of resident competency. The results support that the score is reliable and valid."}, {"Title": "Attitudes of Brazilian psychiatrists toward people with epilepsy.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this survey was to evaluate the experience of Brazilian psychiatrists in treatment, formal training, attitudes, and knowledge with respect to epilepsy (and associated mental disorders).

About one-third (35%) admitted a lack of any formal training in epilepsy, and only 46% confirmed having received some formal training in mental disorders related to epilepsy. Eighty percent were dissatisfied with their knowledge. Three knowledge-based questions were answered correctly by only 10%. Almost half (48%) admitted that among psychiatrists, prejudice exists toward patients with epilepsy. Difficulties with treatment (50%) and lack of knowledge of epilepsy (50%) were considered the main causes of such prejudice. These data indicate an urgent need for improvement in education on epilepsy and associated mental disorders, as well as inclusion of formal epilepsy training in psychiatry residency programs."}, {"Title": "[The past and future of psychiatry and mental treatment in Japan from the standpoint of clinical psychiatry].", "Abstract": "In the early 1950s, there was a serious shortage of hospital beds for mentally ill subjects in Japan, i.e., 30,000 in number as compared to 570,000 in the USA. Plans to supply sufficient beds achieved the goal of providing 280,000 beds in 1975. There were, however, a number of hospitals that fell short of medical and ethical standards, and invited severe criticism. To reconcile the situation, new laws and regulations were introduced to promote many projects for treating patients in the community through social welfare service. Day care institutions and outpatient mental clinics have increased markedly in recent years. Therapeutic measures for mental patients have changed dramatically in the last half of the 20th century, since the discovery of the anti-psychotic effect of chlorpromazine. A great number of psychotropic drugs, some produced in Japan, have been used routinely in psychiatric practice. In the same period of time, many kinds of psychotherapies, some originating in Japan such as the Morita and naikan therapies, have been developed for the relief of various psychological distresses. The diagnosis and classification of mental illnesses have long suffered from uncertainty and discrepancy, even among eminent psychiatrists. The publication of DSM-III in 1980, followed by DSM-III-R and IV and ICD-10, provided professional staff with practical manuals for making diagnoses of mental disorders, and for classifying them using common technical terms. These diagnostic criteria contributed greatly to the development of clinical and basic research in psychiatry.

We expect to be able to elucidate individually different factors related to an attack of illness or relapse. In the treatment of functional mental disorders, future development depends on new drug creations that do not have any side effects or drug-dependence characteristics. Special attention should be paid to new anti-depressants or anti-anxiety drugs that have prompt euphoric effects. Instruments attached to a patient should be as small as possible to avoid psychological stress, and a telemetry feature is desirable to enable recording even during an acute severe stage of behavior disorder. To avoid fixation to the present treatment manual based on EBM (evidence-based medicine), new hypotheses should be investigated.

His psychomotor inhibition, depressive mood, sleep disturbances, general fatigue, muscular pain, and arthralgia were considered to be due to intense work in a stressful environment. Neither his physician nor his orthopedist found any physical disease. Therefore, he was diagnosed with endogenous depression by a psychiatric clinic, and antidepressants were prescribed. Antidepressants were not sufficient for improving his symptoms, and he was admitted to our hospital. Endocrine blood examination revealed primary adrenocortical insufficiency. Treatment with glucocorticoid induced rapid improvement in both the psychiatric and physical symptoms. It is well known that psychiatric symptoms occur in the progressive stage of Addison's disease. At present, however, the occurrence of psychiatric symptoms is very rare, mainly because of a decrease in the incidence of this disease or an increase in mild cases. In addition, Addison's disease presenting with psychiatric features in the early stage has the tendency to be overlooked and misdiagnosed. Thus, we suggest the necessity of blood work for ACTH and cortisol in the field of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[What is impaired consciousness? Revisiting impaired consciousness as psychiatric concept].", "Abstract": "For decades, psychiatrists have considered that concepts of impaired consciousness in the study of psychiatry were inconsistent with those applied in the field of neurology, in which the usefulness of the concept of consciousness has long been seriously doubted. Gloor concluded that the concept of consciousness does not further the understanding of seizure mechanisms or brain function, which is the current representative opinion of most epileptologists. Loss of consciousness tends to be reduced to aggregates of individual impairments of higher cognitive functions, and the concept of consciousness is preferably avoided by neurologists by assigning various behavioral disturbances during disturbed consciousness to particular neuropsychological centers. In contrast, psychiatrists, especially those in Europe, are more likely to include phenomena involving problems related to phenomenological intentionality in impaired consciousness. For the present study, we first divided consciousness into vigilance and recursive consciousness, and then attempted to determine what kind of impaired consciousness would be an ideal candidate to represent pure disturbance of recursive consciousness. Then, 4 patients, 1 each with pure amnestic states followed immediately by complex partial seizures, an akinetic mutistic state caused by absence status, and mental diplopia as a manifestation of postictal psychosis, as well as a patient with Alzheimer's disease who gracefully performed Japanese tea ceremony, were studied. Based on our findings, we concluded that impaired consciousness as a generic term in general medicine does not indicate any unitary entity corresponding to some well-demarcated physiological function or constitute a base from which recursive consciousness emerges as a superstructure. From that, we stressed that a pure form of impairment of recursive consciousness could occur without the impaired consciousness named generically in general medicine. Second, following observation of an additional 3 cases, descriptions of naissance of the first word (taken from the autobiography of Helen Keller), visual object agnosia, and chronic schizophrenia with schizophasia were discussed to examine the relationship between impairments of recursive consciousness and semantic generation dysfunction. Attempts to bridge semantic generation and recursive consciousness, performed by psychopathologists such as Bin Kimura and Hiroyuki Koide, were also briefly discussed. In light of these case presentations and related discussions, we re-examined traditional theories of impaired consciousness, including Mayer-Gross's Gestalt theory, later replaced by Conrad and Henri Ey's theory related to intentionality. Furthermore, we attempted to link Denett's theory of consciousness to those traditional theories as well as to our own postulations, and neuropsychological data such as those of implicit memory and blindsight. Finally, the significance of Freud's unconsciousness in the framework of neuroscience was discussed."}, {"Title": "Further evidence of unique developmental phenotypic correlates of pediatric bipolar disorder: findings from a large sample of clinically referred preadolescent children assessed over the last 7 years.", "Abstract": "A comparison of the prevalence, clinical correlates, and patterns of comorbidity among children with bipolar disorder (BPD) assessed in the early 1990s (1st cohort) with those evaluated over the last 7 years (2nd cohort).\nSubjects in both cohorts were children aged <or=12 years referred to a child psychiatry service and evaluated with identical assessment methods. Children with a DSM-III-R BPD diagnosis (1st cohort, n=43; 2nd cohort, n=129) were identified.

A manic patient is likely, if not treated rapidly, to take actions that will endanger his marriage and his job, if not his (and potentially other people's) life. A manic patient driving at 110 miles an hour through the city may have just had a conversation with his family physician where he denied delusions or hallucinations; yet the result of poor judgment on the road can be life-threatening. The famous European psychiatrist Manfred Bleuler once wrote \"I have seen many cases in which the patient has ruined the happiness, the social condition of himself and of his family for good as he had not been hospitalized at the right time.\" He went on to point out in his letter to me that the modern emphasis on keeping schizophrenic patients out of the hospital in order to reduce hospitalization and dependency (not to mention cost!) has unfortunately and unduly been generalized with respect to the care of the manic patient.

Reasons of admissions for in-patient psychotherapeutic treatment were suicide ideations and attempts, aggression against others and prepsychotic agitation.\nThese results can be seen as a sign of a similar necessity of this care in the eastern as in western population under similar psychosocial conditions."}, {"Title": "[Integration of district psychiatric hospitals into the development of regional community psychiatry networks--the actual state. Results of a survey among medical directors of Bavarian district hospitals].", "Abstract": "In this study, the medical directors of all Bavarian district psychiatric hospitals evaluated certain aspects of the integration of their hospitals into the development of regional community psychiatry networks (\"Gemeindepsychiatrische Verbunde\" - GPVs). They were asked to rate the actual quantity of cooperation between their hospitals and diverse community based services and to express their requests concerning the quality of cooperation. An estimation of possible advantages of the hospitals' integration in GPVs and expectations to future perspectives of GPV development were also investigated. The data were collected by a written questionnaire. The results of the survey indicate that a high relevance is attached to GPV: inspite of current heterogenous developments and inspite of existing skepticism concerning the feasibility of a complete GPV structure, medical directors strongly approve of seeing their hospitals actively engaged in the further development of community psychiatry networks."}, {"Title": "Parting at the crossroads: the emergence of education for psychiatric nursing in three Canadian provinces, 1909-1955.", "Abstract": "Early in the 20th century, nursing emerged as an essential part of psychiatry's attempt to provide scientific care for insanity. Throughout Canada psychiatric nursing is a specialty of general or registered nursing. In Western Canada, however, it is also a separate and distinct profession known as registered psychiatric nursing (RPN). To further the study of nursing history, this paper examines the emergence and early development of mental hospital nursing in Canada, tracing the changing patterns of nurse training from 1909, when Ontario's asylum training school movement was established, to 1955, when education for psychiatric nursing split along the Manitoba-Ontario border into two models. Through case studies in three provinces (Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan), this study examines the question of how Canadian psychiatric nursing developed into two entirely different models. During the 20th century, and interplay of social, political and economic factors emerged which shaped the development of psychiatric nursing and influenced the evolution of the two models. In addition, there were forces within nursing itself, including the effects of specific strategic decisions taken by nursing's leaders and the continuing role of nurses' resistance to the authority expressed by those within the medical profession. The development of psychiatric nursing is best understood by focusing on the point where psychiatry's authority intersected with the gendered limitations of nursing's leaders. This struggle represented a contest for control over education for mental hospital nursing. This paper argues that the turning point in the battle for control of Canadian education for psychiatric nursing occurred when nurse leaders refused to allow the specialty of psychiatric nursing to be taken over by an expanding psychiatric monopoly. The distinct psychiatric-controlled Western Canadian-style apprenticeship training was halted at the Manitoba-Ontario border. That nursing leaders persevered in the struggle to gain authority for psychiatric nursing education was a significant contribution to the development of Canadian nursing education and the psychiatric nursing specialty. Remnants of the themes found in the study endure to the present as organized nursing continues to struggle with issues around autonomy and authority over education and practice."}, {"Title": "Medical students' behaviour, attitudes and knowledge of sleep medicine.", "Abstract": "A seminar on sleep disorders was recently introduced for third, fourth and final year medical students rotating through the psychiatry posting in the Institute of Mental Health. This survey was conducted to assess the attitudes as well as knowledge of medical students towards sleep medicine.\nVerbal consent was taken from the students who were willing to take part in the survey. The MED Sleep Survey, which is an inventory to assess behavior, attitudes and knowledge about sleep, was used to assess the same in the students.\nA total of 240 medical students completed the survey. There were 149 male and 91 female medical students. In terms of their basic sleep knowledge, 46.7 percent scored between 1 and 10 points, 51.7 percent scored between 11 and 20 points, and 1.7 percent scored between 21 and 30 points. There was no significant difference between the different groups in their scores on basic sleep knowledge.\nMost of the medical students scored between 1 and 20 points on basic sleep knowledge items in part III of the survey.

Psychiatry and behavioural sciences are taught in the 4 preclinical years and in the psychiatric clerkship. The integrative nature of this PBL curriculum led us to hypothesise that the knowledge growth curves for these disciplines are similar and show a steady upward trend throughout the curriculum.\nAll items pertaining to psychiatry and behavioural sciences in the progress tests administered in the period from September 1993 through May 2001 were identified. For those items, the percentage of correct scores in the 6 year groups were considered a multivariate observation reflecting knowledge growth across the 6-year programme.\nKnowledge growth for psychiatry and behavioural sciences increased significantly, from 12% to 59% and from 28% to 60%, respectively, between Year 1 and the end of Year 6. Apparently, students know more about behavioural sciences than about psychiatry when they enter medical school, but this difference vanishes in the last 2 years of training. Moreover, the growth curves for psychiatry and behavioural sciences started to level off after Years 3 and 4, respectively, with no additional significant growth in any of the later years.\nPsychiatry and behavioural sciences showed different patterns of knowledge growth and the 2 growth curves levelled off in Years 5 through 6. Because a student-centred, horizontally and vertically integrated PBL curriculum is aimed at effecting steady growth in knowledge in all disciplines, the slowdown in growth in the later years was among the reasons for initiating a major curricular innovation in 2001."}, {"Title": "[Paroxetine versus clomipramine in female adolescents suffering from anorexia nervosa and depressive episode--a retrospective study on tolerability, reasons for discontinuing the antidepressive treatment and different outcome measurements].", "Abstract": "So far, there have only been few studies concerning the question of indication and efficacy of antidepressive medication in children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa and depressive episode in the course of an inpatient treatment. In addition, there is a lack of studies comparing the tolerability and efficacy of different antidepressants given to anorectic patients of this particular age group. This study compares paroxetine, a specific SRI, with clomipramine, a TCA with SRI activity, concerning the frequency and quality of adverse side effects, the frequency and the reasons for discontinuating the antidepressive treatment and different outcome measurements.\n83 female patients, aged 10.9 to 18.1 years, who underwent an inpatient treatment at the Departement of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University of Wuerzburg, Germany, were enrolled in this retrospective study. All of them met the ICD-10 criteria for anorexia nervosa and depressive episode and received an antidepressant medication with clomipramine or paroxetine. We collected data from basic documentation, treatment reports, and the multiaxial classification (MAS). Outcome measurements were the duration of treatment (days) and the increase of body weight (kg/m2).\nThe discontinuation of the antidepressive treatment due to adverse side effects or a lack of efficacy was significantly more frequent with clomipramine than paroxetine (33.3 vs. 15.4%). The increase of body weight (2.8 vs. 2.6 kg/m2) was similar in both groups, but the duration of treatment was significantly shorter under paroxetine (71.9 vs. 96.5 days).\nA shorter duration of treatment, faster increase of body weight, lower percentage of dicontinuating the antidepressive medication and last but not least economic reasons lead to the conclusion, that paroxetine should be preferred in female adolescents with anorexia nervosa and depressive episode.

Most female carriers are clinically symptomatic; however, psychiatric diagnoses have not been reported in this population. We describe four female carriers of AFD disease who met DSM-IV criteria for major depression. All cases had a score above 26 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, indicating severe depression. This was independent of the severity or number of symptoms of AFD disease. Excessive guilt, fatigue, occupational difficulty, suicidal ideation and depressed mood were findings in all cases. In conclusion, the common presence of depression in carriers of AFD implies the need for a multidisciplinary approach, including psychiatry, in management of these patients.

In this report we describe the various ocular manifestations of aniridia as well as the association of familial aniridia with two different ocular and systemic abnormalities present across three generations in two different families.\nDescriptive case series of 33 patients (66 eyes) with aniridia. A full eye examination was performed at the beginning of the study, including past medical history, family history and type of inheritance, assessment for fixation pattern and presence of nystagmus, visual acuity testing, refraction, slit-lamp examination, gonioscopy, fundus examination with pupil dilation and anterior segment photography; additional glaucoma testing was done if the patient had high intraocular pressure. Patients were followed for at least 2 years. The interval between follow-up visits, which included gonioscopy and fundus examination with pupil dilation, depended on the findings in each case. A urology consultation was requested in all sporadic aniridia cases; consultations in psychiatry and gynecology were requested on the basis of the medical history or clinical suspicion during the ophthalmologic examination.\nTen patients (30%) had sporadic aniridia, with no previous family history; Wilms' tumour did not develop in any of them during the follow-up period. In the autosomal dominant group, ocular and systemic findings present in combination with aniridia were observed in 20 patients in the two families. Family I had aniridia and developmental delay or behavioural disorders in three generations as well as high myopia (greater than 6.00 dioptres) in all affected adults. Family 2 presented a wide phenotypic variability of aniridia with myopia in three generations. Open-angle glaucoma developed in three young adults in this family, and two members were found to have gynecologic abnormalities (hypoplastic uterus and imperforate vagina). Myopia was the most prevalent refractive error (64%) in the 33 patients. Refractive correction significantly improved the visual acuity in half of these cases. Glaucoma was present in 10 patients (30%) and was the main cause of vision loss, provoking blindness in two cases (6%). Affected patients manifested progressive angle closure or presented with open-angle glaucoma.\nOphthalmologists should consider aniridia in patients with unusual iris malformations. Examination of family members may be key in making the diagnosis. Any refractive error should be corrected, as this may improve vision. All aniridic patients should be screened regularly for glaucoma, as this condition may occur at any age and can lead to permanent vision loss. Systemic and ocular associations should be considered as they may present in combination with anirida.

Addiction teaching is limited and often fails to change the negative attitudes of many physicians. In many psychiatry residencies, addiction training occurs on inpatient or detoxification units and the focus is on screening, detoxification, and referral. Most residents do not gain adequate experience in the long-term management of dual-diagnosis patients. Successful clinical care is based on three critical elements (the \"clinician's triad\"): an adequate knowledge base, a positive attitude toward the patient and the benefits of treatment, and a sense of responsibility for the clinical problem. The Boston University Psychiatry Residency has designed an addiction training program to address these three issues. In addition to a comprehensive addiction seminar series, there are several unique features. The required clinical rotation occurs in an outpatient dual-diagnosis clinic and permits residents to follow a caseload of patients for 12 months. Extensive experience is gained in motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, and pharmacotherapy. Self-directed learning approaches are used to maximize the educational experience on services that lack addiction faculty. Guidelines are provided for establishing a similar program and for more effective approaches to resident teaching."}, {"Title": "Association of alcohol and drug use disorders and completed suicide: an empirical review of cohort studies.", "Abstract": "This study updated and expanded upon Harris and Barraclough's empirical review [Harris, E.C., Barraclough, B., 1997.

To find additional studies, (1) the location of English language reports on MEDLINE (1994-2002) were identified with the search terms 'substance-disorders' with 'mortality' and 'follow-up', (2) read throughs were conducted of four prominent alcohol and drug specialty journals from 1966 through 2002, and (3) the reference sections of studies that met criteria were searched for additional reports.

There is a large empirical literature on alcohol use disorders and suicide and a moderate literature on suicide and opioid use disorders and IV drug use. There remains limited prospective data on the association of suicide and other drug use disorders (e.g., cocaine, cannabis)."}, {"Title": "Temperament and depressive symptoms: a population-based longitudinal study on Cloninger's psychobiological temperament model.", "Abstract": "This study examined whether temperament dimensions, as indicated by Cloninger's psychobiological model [Cloninger, C.R., Svrakic, D.M., Przybeck, T.R., 1993.

Despite that fact, experienced clinicians continue to use this combination for a variety of indications after other options have failed. This article reviews these reported uses and presents a case suggesting another possible indication.\nA MEDLINE search was conducted for articles published from 1962 to December 2003 using relevant search terms (psychostimulant, stimulant, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, pemoline or methylphenidate, atomoxetine, bupropion, monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and selegiline). A manual search was conducted of cross-references and other relevant recent psychiatric sources (2000-2003).\nThe described uses of the MAOI-stimulant combination have included treatment of refractory depression and the MAOI-related side effects of orthostatic hypotension and daytime sedation. No documented reports were found in the recent literature of hypertensive crises or fatalities occurring when the stimulant was cautiously added to the MAOI. Also presented here is another possible indication for this therapeutic regimen: treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in an adult patient whose major depression had uniquely responded to the MAOI tranylcypromine.\nAs in other fields of medicine, potentially hazardous medication combinations are utilized in psychiatry after cautiously weighing the danger of the treatment against the morbidity and risk of not adequately addressing the illness.

Space is a central category in both the story of exiles and in the collective history of receiving countries, but it has different emotional, social, cultural and political meanings. Sometimes stories of exile are denied a place in the social memory of a society. Therefore, recollection and making sense of experienced misery in foreign contexts is often a difficult and lonely undertaking. The article links the story to macro-political processes and attempts to answer questions regarding the consequences of the lack of meaningful space for exiles to remember. Collective and national memories and ceremonies are often exclusive and offer no place for 'alien' memories. Therapeutic repertoires often fail to address the emotional value of communal sharing a socio-cultural and (meta) physical space. It is argued that because the state does not take responsibility for providing a (symbolic) space for the mourning and reconciliation of people whose memories are out of place, transcultural psychiatry - its subsystem - will have to reflect on how to provide such a space."}, {"Title": "The AGNP-TDM expert group consensus guidelines: therapeutic drug monitoring in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) is a valid tool to optimise pharmacotherapy. It enables the clinician to adjust the dosage of drugs according to the characteristics of the individual patient. In psychiatry, TDM is an established procedure for lithium, some antidepressants and antipsychotics. In spite of its obvious advantages, however, the use of TDM in everyday clinical practice is far from optimal. The interdisciplinary TDM group of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Neuropsychopharmakologie und Pharmakopsychiatrie (AGNP) has therefore worked out consensus guidelines to assist psychiatrists and laboratories involved in psychotropic drug analysis to optimise the use of TDM of psychotropic drugs. Five research-based levels of recommendation were defined with regard to routine monitoring of plasma concentrations for dose titration of 65 psychoactive drugs: (1) strongly recommended, (2) recommended, (3) useful, (4) probably useful and (5) not recommended. A second approach defined indications to use TDM, e. g. control of compliance, lack of clinical response or adverse effects at recommended doses, drug interactions, pharmacovigilance programs, presence of a genetic particularity concerning the drug metabolism, children, adolescents and elderly patients. Indications for TDM are relevant for all drugs either with or without validated therapeutic ranges. When studies on therapeutic ranges are lacking, target ranges should be plasma concentrations that are normally observed at therapeutic doses of the drug. Therapeutic ranges of plasma concentrations that are considered to be optimal for treatment are proposed for those drugs, for which the evaluation of the literature demonstrated strong evidence. Moreover, situations are defined when pharmacogenetic (phenotyping or genotyping) tests are informative in addition to TDM. Finally, practical instructions are given how to use TDM. They consider preparation of TDM, analytical procedures, reporting and interpretation of results and the use of information for patient treatment. Using the consensus guideline will help to ensure optimal clinical benefit of TDM in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Forensic and medical legal issues in addiction psychiatry.", "Abstract": "There is a broad range of forensic issues in addiction psychiatry. For many psychiatrists, what is most challenging about addressing these issues is their origin in the law, which is a system and a way of thinking that may feel foreign to the medical practitioner. To address forensic issues, addiction psychiatrists should learn and understand the specific legal questions that arise in each forensic context. They should become familiar with the relevant definitions, criteria, and legal requirements that apply in each specific area of their practice, rather than assume that clinical definitions and reasoning will carry them. If they perform forensic evaluations, addiction psychiatrists must distance themselves from the wish to help the examinee, focusing on the role of neutral examiner.

Similarly, negative schizophrenia symptoms were significantly less often present in study participants (n = 17) than in controls (n = 38; p < or = 0.05). Study participants were also medically and neurologically healthier than controls. (p = 0.05 respectively). No differences in overall illness severity as depicted by CGI and GAF were observed.\nWe found the patients included in our clinical trials representative of the patient encountered in routine clinical practice. Adherence to inclusion and exclusion criteria prevents inclusion of severely ill (e. g. suicidal) patients requiring a more intensive treatment setting. Illness severity was found to be similar in trial participants and controls, and indicates an overall comparably severe psychopathology. The more chronic, rather treatment refractory patients were also not reflected in the trial participant pool; this population may arguably not represent the average clinical patient either. A more careful administration of antipsychotic medication was found in trial participants and may effectively be considered \"good clinical practice\"."}, {"Title": "Burden of relatives and predictors of burden. Baseline results from the Munich 5-year-follow-up study on relatives of first hospitalized patients with schizophrenia or depression.", "Abstract": "In the present study, part of the Munich 5-year follow-up study on key relatives of first-hospitalized schizophrenic and depressive patients, baseline results with respect to relatives' burden and predictors of burden are presented. Basing on a transactional stress model the following hypothesis was tested: the impact of the patients' illness on their relatives' stress outcome is moderated by the psychosocial resources of the relatives. Stress outcome was measured in terms of objective and subjective burden, well-being, self-rated symptoms and global satisfaction with life. Potential moderating variables included age and gender, generalized stress response and illness-related coping strategies, beliefs of control,perceived social support,personality factors, expressed emotion and life stressors. A total of 83 relatives, whose ill family members had been hospitalized in the Department of Psychiatry of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich for the first time, participated in the study. Findings did not entirely support the hypothesis. On the one hand, relatives' stress outcome was independent of the objective stressors (severity of the illness, kind of symptoms, level of psychosocial functioning at admission). On the other hand, burden was significantly associated with several psychosocial resources and dispositions of the relatives. Multivariate linear regression analyses indicated that expressed emotion, emotion-focused coping strategies and generalized negative stress response are the most relevant predictors of burden. It is argued that a multidimensional approach in burden assessment is necessary and has relevant implications for improving family intervention strategies."}, {"Title": "The rebirth of PTSD: the rise of a new paradigm in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The new conception of psychological trauma that arose in the 1980s with the definition of PTSD in the DSM-III was a major change compared to the previous traumatic neurosis. While the clinical features were in some way similar, the political and sociological meanings of trauma were absolutely different. At that time, the invention of PTSD was much more the consequence of a broad mutation in mentality that introduced a new moral perspective in trauma studies than of a scientific discovery. In this paper, the author underlines from an anthropological point of view the second turning point that occurred in trauma studies in the mid 1990s when large epidemiological surveys did not confirm the first hypothesis. Readdressing the issues of vulnerability and risk factors that the previous version of PTSD had withdrawn, this second conception raises new epistemological questions that stay unsolved."}, {"Title": "Screening for Depression in the Medically Ill: a comparison of self-report measures, clinician judgment, and DSM-IV diagnoses.", "Abstract": "The performance of the self-report 10-item Depression in the Medically Ill scale was observed in 210 patients as part of clinical assessment by consultation-liaison psychiatry clinicians.

If such an effect would be caused by impaired psychic and psychomotor functioning due to more frequent anxiety among women, it should also appear in injury crashes.\nWe used the national Finnish road accident database for 1989-2002. To control seasonal variation, 21 Fridays the 13th were compared in a matched design to previous and following Fridays, excluding all holidays, on number of accidents, male/female responsibility for accidents, and the number of dead, injured and overall number of active participants (drivers, pedestrians and bicyclists) as a consequence of the accident.\nThere were no significant differences in any examined aspect of road injury accidents among the three Fridays, either in females or males. Women were not overrepresented in crashes that occurred on Fridays 13th.\nThere is no consistent evidence for females having more road traffic crashes on Fridays the 13th, based on deaths or road accident statistics. However, this does not imply a non-existent effect of superstition related anxiety on accident risk as no exposure-to-risk data are available.

At up to four time-points during the index-treatment episode patients were assessed at different levels of outcome: Psychopathology was rated by researchers using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (24-Item-Version), and patients evaluated their satisfaction with treatment (Patientenbogen zur Behandlungszufriedenheit); at admission and discharge patients also assessed their subjective quality of life (Manchester Assessment of Quality of Life). Mean scale scores of these instruments are used for the intention-to-treat-analysis. Discharge status on these scales as well as mean ratings on these scales within the index-treatment episode serve as measures of effectiveness. For statistically identifying differences between the two settings five linear (co-)variance-analytical models were calculated for each target variable. Four models were adjusted to baseline-rating or to the individual period spent in treatment.\nInitially, both groups did not differ in their relevant socio-demographic and illness-related features. Day hospital treatment (87,7 days) lasted significantly longer than inpatient treatment (67,8 days). Only results from an unadjusted statistical model as well as from a model adjusted to the individual period of index-hospitalisation demonstrated superior effectiveness of day hospital treatment on the discharge status of psychopathological symptomatology. However, in all statistical models there were no systematic differences of treatment-effectiveness related to satisfaction with treatment and subjective quality of life.\nFor the first time in German-speaking countries, this study provides evidence for the effectiveness of acute day hospital treatment as compared to conventional inpatient treatment.

The authors examined the relationship of homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B12 with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of neuropathology.\nIn this archival study, authors reviewed the MRIs and medical records of 34 inpatients in a geriatric psychiatry unit. Patients were selected if folate, B12, and/or homocysteine levels had been assessed and if the appropriate clinical MRIs were performed (19 men; mean age, 75 years). Patients with schizophrenia or current substance dependence were excluded. The relationships between MRI volume measures, white-matter hyperintensity (WMH) grade, and serum concentrations of folate, B12, and homocysteine were analyzed, using age-adjusted Pearson correlations.\nHomocysteine was related to WMH grade, but not brain-volume measures. Folate was associated with hippocampus and amygdala, and negatively associated with WMH. B12 level was not statistically associated with any brain measure.\nElevated homocysteine and low folate were associated with radiological markers of neuropathology. Since no patient had clinically deficient folate, it may be important to rethink what defines functionally significant micronutrient deficiency and explore what this means in different age- and health-status groups. Larger samples will be needed to assess interactions between homocysteine, micronutrients, and other neuropathology risk factors."}, {"Title": "Dissociation and childhood abuse history in epileptic and pseudoseizure patients.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine dissociative experiences, childhood abuse and anxiety in epileptic and pseudoseizure female patients.

The research data are the transcripts of in-depth interviews with three experienced practitioners, one from each of the three disciplines. The analysis draws on Foucauldian concepts: discourse as constructed through practices of discipline and the gaze. We explored examples of taken-for-granted assessment practices and their interplay with discourse. The findings suggest that participating practitioners use language in assessment in ways that support the powerful discourses of the professional disciplines. The competing discourse of management, associated with industry and economics, is evident in hospital admission processes, dictating the times and places of assessment. Professional and management discourses both effectively marginalize the perspective of another player in assessment, the patient."}, {"Title": "[Adult psychiatry does not recognize child neuropsychiatric disorders.

MBC accounts for approximately 1% of breast cancer patients. A total of 182 men died of breast cancer in 1999, in Germany. In the US, 1500 new cases per year occur. MBC accounts for <5% of surgically removed breast lumps. Diseases with increased oestrogen action increase the risk of MBC. Mutations of distinct genes are estimated to account for up to roughly 10% of MBC. BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are responsible for approximately 80% of the families with hereditary breast cancer.

They are products of a historically contingent and culture specific formulation of a class of social problems of behavior that came to the fore in relation to intellectual and political economic changes of those societies. However, such problems have a long ancestry. They are intrinsic to human species and the social and cultural systems that its members have evolved since their emergence. This article reviews intellectual quandaries raised by evolutionary study of psychiatric conditions, those of crossing the human/animal divide and crossing historically contingent cultures; and of framing history of psychiatry in terms of social and cultural evolution. The biological architecture underlying psychiatric conditions and the breakthroughs that indigenous psychiatry of different types of societies underwent in formulating signs and symptoms are discussed."}, {"Title": "[Persistent psychotic disorder following bilateral mesencephalo-thalamic ischaemia: case report].", "Abstract": "A 38-year old male patient with no history of psychiatric illness developed a progressive psychotic disorder after bilateral (predominantly left) mesencephalo-thalamic cerebral ischaemia. The reason of the emergency hospitalization was the sudden onset of a confusional state, culminating in a fluctuating comatose status. The neurological examination found mild right hemiparesia, praxic disorders and reactive left mydriasis with paresia of the downward vertical stare, leading to the hospitalisation in the neurology department for suspicion of a cerebral vascular ischaemic accident. The psychiatric symptoms started with acoustic-verbal hallucinations, poorly structured paranoid delusions, progressively developed over two weeks, followed by behavioural disorders with psychomotor agitation and heteroaggressivity. The patient was transferred to the psychiatric department, because of the heteroaggressive risk and lack of morbid consciousness, in spite of recovering from the confusional status. An intensive psychiatric management was proposed, combining a psychotherapeutic approach with 4 mg of risperidone and adjustable doses of benzodiazepine according to the psychomotor agitation. During the next days, there was a net recovery of the behavioural disorders, in spite of the persistence of the ideas of persecution. All the neurological symptoms also decreased. An anomaly of the polygon of Willis was found on a cerebral arteriography (the posterior cerebral arteries had a foetal origin, dependent on carotidal axes and not on the vertebro-basilar system). The main emboligen risk factor was the presence of a permeable foramen ovale, discovered during a transoesophageal echography. The patient underwent a surgical correction of the permeable foramen ovale. The psychiatric hospitalization for three months was continued by ambulatory follow-up. The initial positive symptoms (delusions, acoustic-verbal hallucinations) progressively diminished while negative symptoms became predominant after few months. One year after the first hospitalization the patient presented a second psychotic decompensation, with delusions of persecution, jealousy and behavioural disorders with heteroaggressivity, that required an emergency psychiatric hospitalization. The wife of the patient decided to divorce, because she was \"frightened by the threats of death\" from her husband. A neurological assessment during the second hospitalization in psychiatry did not find new ischaemic lesions after the cardiac surgery for the permeable foramen ovale, nor relevant changes in cerebral perfusion. The final diagnosis after the psychiatric follow-up of 14 months was: psychotic disorder with delusional ideas, due to cerebral ischaemia (DSM IV). There are relatively few data in the literature regarding persistent psychotic disorders in the context of ischaemic mesencephalo-thalamic lesions. However, several authors support the hypothesis of a possible disconnection of the thalamic nuclei, the frontal lobes and limbic system as a risk factor or a triggering factor for psychotic disorders in cerebral ischaemia. Observations concerning the occurrence of psychotic disorders following cerebral--especially localised--ischaemia may help to better understand the neuro-physiological mechanisms triggering or accompanying the psychiatric symptomatology. The role of functional cerebral imagery in the detection of possible structural lesions related to clinical observations must be emphasised. The slow progression (over a year) to psychotic disorder with predominantly negative symptoms emphasized the importance for long-term prospective studies. Isolated clinical observations arouse the interest for a specific scale for psychotic disorders occurring after cerebral ischaemia, similar to existing specific scale for post-ischaemic depressive disorders. The necessity of systematic psychiatric examination and re-evaluations in thalamic cerebral ischaemia is to be highlighted, both for the differential diagnosis and for the early psychiatric care."}, {"Title": "[Transcranial magnetic stimulation in cognition and neuropsychology].", "Abstract": "Classical neuropsychology relies on patients with irreversible brain lesions and cognitive impairments give informations about normal brain function. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method which involves placing an electromagnetic coil on the scalp. A pulse generates a magnetic field and this one passes, unattenuated by the skin and scalp, into the cortex inducing a current which results in neural activity. The technique shows a good temporal resolution and, moreover, because it represents an interference technique, can be said to have excellent functional resolution. For this reason, TMS appears to be a new tool for research in neuropsychology, producing transitory 'virtual lesion'effects which could help to understand how, when and where cognitive tasks are performed. The purpose of this article is to review recent research using TMS in cognition and neuropsychology, in a non exhaustive way. In safety studies, single TMS over motor cortex can produce simple movements. Several groups have applied TMS to the study of visual processing and found an impaired detection of visual stimuli. In a same way, TMS can disrupt speech when it was delivered in the language dominant hemisphere. Studies on the memory effects of TMS have been conflicting and the results seem to depend on the choice of paradigm and parameters. Other study depicted improvements in executive functioning after TMS on the left middle frontal gyrus or a diminution in reaction time during an analogic reasoning task. Moreover, some facial emotions seem to be less recognizable after TMS. Although TMS seem to be a new tool for neuro-psychological investigations in healthy subjects, few studies reported cognitive effects of rTMS treatment in psychiatry. In a therapeutic view, many of these trials have supported a significant effect of TMS, but in some studies the effect is small and short lived. Several groups have reported on the use of rTMS as a treatment in resistant major depression and the impact on cognition functioning. Most of results tend to find no adverse cognitive effects after several weeks of daily rTMS in depressed patients, compared to Electroconvulsivo-therapy (ECT). The effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on hallucination severity and neurocognition were studied in a recent study. A statistically significant improvement was observed on a hallucination scale and on one cognitive measure. TMS is a promising tool for cognitive neuroscience and can provide complementary information to the one obtained using neuropsychological tests, and the one obtained using functional imaging techniques, which have superior spatial but inferior temporal resolution."}, {"Title": "Psychoneuroimmunology: then and now.", "Abstract": "Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) emerged in the neurosciences in the late 1970s to early 1980s and has extended to influence the fields of psychology, psychiatry, endocrinology, physiology, and the biomedical research community. This review documents the journey of PNI from the early 1980s to the present. Today, we recognize that the highly complex immune system interacts with an equally complex nervous system in a bidirectional manner. Evolutionarily old signals continue to play a role in these communications, as do mechanisms for protection of the host. The disparity between physical and psychological stressors is only an illusion. Host defense mechanisms respond in adaptive and meaningful ways to both. The present review will describe a new way of thinking about evolutionarily old molecules, heat shock proteins, adding to a body of evidence suggesting that activation of the acute stress response is a double-edged sword that can both benefit and derail optimal immunity."}, {"Title": "Vascular cognitive disorder: a new diagnostic category updating vascular cognitive impairment and vascular dementia.", "Abstract": "Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) was proposed as an umbrella term to include subjects affected with any degree of cognitive impairment resulting from cerebrovascular disease (CVD), ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to vascular dementia. VCI may or may not exclude the host of \"focal\" circumscribed impairments of specialized functions such as language (aphasia), intentional gesture (apraxia), or categorical recognition (agnosia), among others, that may result from a stroke. Therefore, there are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria for VCI. We conclude that this concept could be more useful if it were to be limited to cases of vascular MCI without dementia, by analogy with the concept of amnestic MCI, currently considered the earliest clinically diagnosable stage of Alzheimer disease (AD). In agreement with our view,the Canadian Study on Health and Aging successfully implemented a restricted definition of VCI, excluding cases of dementia (i.e., vascular cognitive impairment no dementia, VCI-ND). The Canadian definition and diagnostic criteria could be utilized for future studies of VCI. This definition excludes isolated impairments of specialized cognitive functions. Vascular dementia (VaD): The main problem of this diagnostic category stems from the currently accepted definition of dementia that requires memory loss as the sine qua non for the diagnosis. This may result in over-sampling of patients with AD worsened by stroke (AD+CVD). This problem was minimized in controlled clinical trials of VaD by excluding patients with a prior diagnosis of AD, those with pre-existing memory loss before the index stroke, and those with amnestic MCI. We propose a definition of dementia in VaD based on presence of abnormal executive control function, severe enough to interfere with social or occupational functioning. Vascular cognitive disorder (VCD): This term, proposed by Sachdev [P. Sachdev, Vascular cognitive disorder. Int J Geriat Psychiatry 14 (1999)402-403.] would become the global diagnostic category for cognitive impairment of vascular origin, ranging from VCI to VaD. It would include specific disease entities such as post-stroke VCI, post-stroke VaD, CADASIL, Binswanger disease, and AD plus CVD. This category explicitly excludes isolated cognitive dysfunctions such as those mentioned above."}, {"Title": "[Implication of genes of the serotonergic system on vulnerability to suicidal behavior].", "Abstract": "There are many risk factors associated with vulnerability to suicidal behaviour, and the results of family studies, twin studies and adoption studies suggest that they include a genetic predisposition. Moreover, this gentic susceptibility may be specific and independent of the genetic susceptibility to psychiatric disorders associated with suicidal behaviour (e.g., bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, alcoholism). Several groups have carried out association studies using a \"candidate gene strategy\", with the goal of identifying the genes involved in susceptibility to suicidal behavior. There is compelling evidence from research in biological psychiatry that abnormalities in the functioning of the central serotonergic system are involved in the pathogenesis of suicidal behavior, and the results of association studies suggest that the gene coding for tryptophan hydroxylase, which is the serotonin synthesis enzyme, and the serotonin transporter gene are involved in susceptibility to suicidal behavior. Furthermore, these genes may influence the suicidal phenotype through different gene-gene interactions and gene-early environment interactions. Current studies aim to identify either the precise phenotypes associated with genes for vulnerability to suicidal behaviour or the intermediate phenotypes (e.g., impulsivity, anger dyscontrol) associated with these genes."}, {"Title": "The clock drawing test as a measure of executive dysfunction in elderly depressed patients.", "Abstract": "The aims of this research were to determine whether performance on the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) could accurately distinguish between older patients with depression and older patients with depression and previously undocumented executive dysfunction and to determine if there was a correlation between CDT and depression severity.

All the subjects completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), and the CDT, as well as the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The patients were divided into 2 subgroups based on the DRS score: <129 (cognitive impairment) versus = 129. Results indicated that the depressed patients with a score of DRS <129 had significantly lower CDT scores than did patients with DRS = 129 and normal comparison subjects (P< .01).

Both agents would come into the history as the drugs that made possible the beginning of the psychopharmacological era. In the present article, a revision is made of the complicated process leading to the isolation and synthesis of reserpine, by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Ciba (Schlittler and M\u00fcller) and how its pharmacological properties (Bein) were discovered and studied, in the animals laboratory, mainly, the \"tranquillizers\". The introduction of this antipsychotic in psychiatry, which was initiated in 1954 (half a century ago), and the results obtained in the first clinical studies, as well as the role played by researchers such as Kline, Delay, Noce, Hollister, Altschule, etc. are then described. In addition, and from a historical perspective, the discovery of the adverse effects of this drug, especially those of extrapyramidal nature (dyskinesia and akathisia), are studied, concluding with the reasons that produced its rapid clinical decline, among which the genesis of depressive pictures (phenomenon presently questioned) may be emphasized.

The research focussed on the frequency of suicide attempts in relation to the time of the day, day of the week, and month of the year. Temporal fluctuations in the frequency of suicide attempts have been assessed on the basis of the data from medical documentation concerning 2757 suicide attempts by individuals ranging in age from 14 to 90 years. The group consisted of 1607 females and 1150 males. According to the results of the research, seasonality and temporal fluctuations in the frequency of suicide attempts is different for males and females. In the case of the males examined, no dependence between the frequency of suicide attempts and a particular month or season has been observed. In the case of females, on the contrary, the data indicate the existence of a seasonal pattern with the peak in the spring (or early part of the summer), and in the autumn--in October and November. In males, the peak day for attempted suicide was Monday, whereas in females--Sunday and Monday. As regards the time of the day, both the results of the present research and data collected by WHO/EURO indicate that suicide attempts occurred most frequently in the evening, late in the evening or in the early part the night. In conclusion, it has been emphasized that the majority of suicide attempts, especially by females, occurs late in the evening or early in the night. This finding seems to be of particular importance for suicide prevention--it can contribute to the increase in the effectiveness of the organization of work in the Crisis Intervention Centres and make therapists and patients' families aware of the existence of periods of an increased suicide risk. The research has been conducted owing to the cooperation between the department of Clinical Toxicology, CMUJ and the Department of Adult Clinical Psychiatry, CMUJ in Krak\u00f3w. The results obtained, together with the results of the research conducted by the centres participating in WHO/EURO are vital for suicide prevention and treatment."}, {"Title": "[The role of epidemiology in mental disorder research].", "Abstract": "Mental disorders, including substance abuse, are part of the Mexican epidemiologic scenario and will remain so during several decades. They may even become more prominent as causes of disease, disability, and death in our country. It is thus imperative to frame appropriate management strategies to curb these problems without delay. This paper aims at outlining epidemiology of mental diseases as a field of study, and to identify its limitations. Emphasis is made on common elements shared with other more traditional fields of epidemiology, as well as on the specific contributions made by this particular field to epidemiology and to psychiatry in general. This paper describes the main study designs and problems in this field of epidemiology, its usefulness in prevention actions, and future challenges. A unique characteristic of mental disorder epidemiology is that its target diseases manifest in two levels: behaviorally (for example, compulsive hand-washing) and as an element of the individual's mental life (e.g., obsession with bacteria being a constant, omnipresent health threat). It follows that much of the knowledge currently available on the phenomena of mental disorders in general is based on the self-reported insight of individuals. Trained clinicians have collected such reports by interview or with standardized questionnaires. This field of epidemiology is characterized by having two-sides: a mental disorder is a problem in and of itself, causing suffering and prompting the search for specialized care, as it has peculiar clinical manifestations. On the other hand, mental disorder epidemiology also focuses on determining factors (drug use, abuse, or addiction) and on the way these independent variables result in certain processes and outcomes (such as accidents, homicide, suicide, liver cirrhosis, etc.). Finally, the epidemiology of mental disorders has also been set apart by its focus in series of processes that are not suitably classified as syndromes, but which are germane to public health, for example, violence. The epidemiology of mental disorders faces great challenges in the new millennium, including a complex, changing epidemiologic scenario. Several important issues will influence the future development of mental disorder epidemiology: measurement of mental disorders and risk factors, more efficient sampling design and methods, the relationships among biological research, genetics, social studies, and epidemiology, and the interface between epidemiology and the evaluation of therapies and health services."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatric examination performed by phone to determine guardianship--is it legally valid?].", "Abstract": "The administration of a psychiatric evaluation to determine guardianship entails the prerequisite of a full psychiatric examination of the patient. In psychogeriatrics, dementia is the common reason for measures to determine incompetence and guardianship and in general psychiatry it is applicable for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Legal guardianship is determined by the court and can apply to aspects involving confidentiality such as the patient's assets or body or both, and its duration can be temporary or permanent. This is a case study of a 30 year old man who had never undergone a psychiatric examination. His parents reported behavior that was suggestive of a prolonged paranoid psychotic state for the past 8 years with deterioration in the last year. All attempts by his parents to bring him to a medical or psychiatric examination were refused by the patient. In order to prevent further deterioration of the situation, the family was advised to request legal guardianship for him. Due to his refusal to be examined and the lack of indication for a forced examination, a long taped phone conversation was conducted with the patient and later validated to ensure that this was the patient in question. This conversation together with heteroanamnesis, provided the basis for writing a psychiatric evaluation recommending the appointment of a legal guardian for the patient. To the best of our knowledge, the court's decision to appoint a legal guardian based on a telephone conversation is a precedent."}, {"Title": "The reliability of the Brazilian version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1).", "Abstract": "The objective of the present study was to determine the reliability of the Brazilian version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 2.1 (CIDI 2.1) in clinical psychiatry. The CIDI 2.1 was translated into Portuguese using WHO guidelines and reliability was studied using the inter-rater reliability method. The study sample consisted of 186 subjects from psychiatric hospitals and clinics, primary care centers and community services. The interviewers consisted of a group of 13 lay and three non-lay interviewers submitted to the CIDI training. The average interview time was 2 h and 30 min. General reliability ranged from kappa 0.50 to 1. For lifetime diagnoses the reliability ranged from kappa 0.77 (Bipolar Affective Disorder) to 1 (Substance-Related Disorder, Alcohol-Related Disorder, Eating Disorders). Previous year reliability ranged from kappa 0.66 (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) to 1 (Dissociative Disorders, Maniac Disorders, Eating Disorders). The poorest reliability rate was found for Mild Depressive Episode (kappa = 0.50) during the previous year. Training proved to be a fundamental factor for maintaining good reliability. Technical knowledge of the questionnaire compensated for the lack of psychiatric knowledge of the lay personnel. Inter-rater reliability was good to excellent for persons in psychiatric practice."}, {"Title": "[Interpersonal Therapy: a brief and focal model].", "Abstract": "Psychotherapy is a particular form of treatment in Psychiatry.

High rates of psychopathology have been identified amongst children and adolescents attending general practice and paediatric services, most of it ''hidden'' at presentation and emotional in nature. It is often linked to poor physical well being and to maternal stress focused on the child. It may be of special relevance to medical help seeking in socio-economically advantaged areas. Co-morbid psychopathology, mainly emotional disorders, is common amongst children with unexplained medical symptoms. However, there are specific psychosocial aspects that differentiate these children from those with emotional disorders. They involve disease beliefs, illness behaviour and predicament. The latter may be characterised by special reactivity to stress in children with personality vulnerability, in a context of parents with high levels of mental distress, unexplained medical symptoms and emotional over-involvement with the child. There is comparatively little interface work between CAMHS and primary health care. An important research priority would seem to lie in the development of interventions that can be adapted for use by primary care staff. Similarly, there are few dedicated CAMHS paediatric liaison teams. Their more extensive development should help attend in a more informed and focused way than at present to children and adolescents suffering from unexplained physical symptoms and disorders. Further research is needed into vulnerability mechanisms and maintaining factors, health beliefs, treatment engagement and interventions."}, {"Title": "Resolution of the polarisation of ideologies and approaches in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The uniqueness of Psychiatry as a medical speciality lies in the fact that aside from tackling what it considers as illnesses, it has perchance to comment on and tackle many issues of social relevance as well. Whether this is advisable or not is another matter; but such a process is inevitable due to the inherent nature of the branch and the problems it deals with. Moreover this is at the root of the polarization of psychiatry into opposing psychosocial and biological schools. This gets reflected in their visualization of scope, in definitions and in methodology as well. Whilst healthy criticism of one against the other school is necessary, there should be caution against hasty application of one's frame of reference to an approach that does not intend to follow, or conform to, one's methodology. This should be done within the referential framework of the school critically evaluated, with due consideration for its methods and concepts. Similarly, as at present, there is no evidence to prove one or the other of these approaches as better, aside from personal choice. We can say so even if there is a strong paradigm shift towards the biological at present. A renaissance of scientific psychoanalysis coupled with a perceptive neurobiology which can translate those insights into testable hypotheses holds the greatest promise for psychiatry in the future. This suggests the need for unification of diverse appearing approaches to get a more comprehensive and enlightened worldview. It requires a highly integrative capacity. Just as a physicist thinks simultaneously in terms of particles and waves, a psychiatrist must think of motives, emotions and desires in the same breath as neurobiology, genetics and psychopharmacology. However, the integration must be attempted without destroying the internal cohesiveness of the individual schools. This will give a fair chance for polarization in which a single proper approach in psychiatry could emerge, which may be a conglomerate of diverse appearing approaches of today, or one which supersedes the rest. A synthesis of cognitive psychology and neuroscience offers the greatest promise at present."}, {"Title": "Telemedicine in the USA with focus on clinical applications and issues.", "Abstract": "Telemedicine usually refers to the use of information-based technologies, such as, computer and communications systems, to provide healthcare across geographic distances.

Persistent vomiting, however, poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for the primary care physician. In addition to gastrointestinal, neurologic, and endocrine disorders, the differential diagnosis includes psychiatric illnesses, such as eating and factitious disorders. We present the case of a 52-year-old woman referred to the Tulane University Internal Medicine/Psychiatry clinic with persistent daily vomiting for 8 years despite repeated medical evaluations. The vomiting was of sufficient severity to require intensive care unit admission for hematemesis. A dually trained internal medicine-psychiatry house officer obtained further history and identified that the woman experienced an intrusive thought that urged her to vomit after each meal. Resisting the urge resulted in intolerable anxiety that was relieved only by vomiting. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. Initiation of escitalopram with titration to clinical response resulted in full symptom resolution and meaningful quality of life improvement. Pertinent literature was reviewed using 2 methods: (1) an English-language MEDLINE search (1966-February 2004) using the search terms vomiting and (chronicor psychogenicor psychiatric), and obsessive-compulsive disorder and (primary care or treatment); and (2) a direct search of reference lists of pertinent journal articles. A review of psychiatric etiologies of vomiting and primary care aspects of OCD is presented. Primary care clinicians are strongly encouraged to consider psychiatric etiologies, including OCD, when common symptoms persist or present in atypical ways.

Within the Department of Psychiatry at Lund University Hospital, 45 women with experiences of childhood sexual abuse were offered a 2-year long trauma-focused group therapy. Half of the women had been sexually abused during childhood in pre-school ages and half by a perpetrator who was the biological father. Two-thirds had been abused for more than 5 years and half through penetration. There was a statistical significance between age of onset (0-6 years) and psychiatric symptoms including eight of nine subscales, according to results from use of the questionnaire Symptom Check List (SCL-90). According to the same questionnaire, there also was a statistical significance between the perpetrator (male relative) and the subscale interpersonal sensitivity. According to the Interview Schedule of Social Interaction, there was a statistical significance between the abuse form penetration and the social integration in the subscale availability of attachment. Thirty-five women (78%) had not told anyone about the sexual abuse when it happened, and the most common reason for this was fear of not being believed."}, {"Title": "The prevalence of dyslexia and AD/HD in a sample of forensic psychiatric rapists.", "Abstract": "The prevalence of dyslexia and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) (DSM-IV) is markedly increased among those who are sentenced for criminal offences. The aim of the study was to identify developmental disabilities, dyslexia and AD/HD among severely disturbed men in forensic psychiatric care, and to study the co-occurrence of such disabilities, with the objective to discuss the importance of the diagnoses in forensic psychiatry. The participants were 10 males who had committed rape on adult women, and included two murder-rapists, one of which had murdered more than one victim (i.e. a serial murderer). All had been assigned to special long-term forensic psychiatric care, based predominantly on a psychodynamic ground. In order to be identified as having dyslexia, a participant's performance on at least three out of four tests of academic skills had to be markedly below the expected level (more than two stanine steps), given the participant's non-verbal intellectual capacity and considering the length of his education. AD/HD was investigated by studying the participants' forensic psychiatric files and by a clinical interview. Seven of the 10 participants met the DSM-IV criteria for dyslexia, and six of them met the DSM-IV criteria for AD/HD. Four participants had AD/HD and dyslexia, three had AD/HD but no dyslexia, and two had dyslexia but no AD/HD. Only one participant had neither dyslexia nor AD/HD. The participants with dyslexia performed well in tests assessing non-verbal reasoning, visuo-spatial capacity and visual memory. Although the generalization of the results from 10 rapists is severely limited, the results indicate the importance of assessing dyslexia as well as AD/HD in people who are admitted for forensic psychiatric assessment. The lack of correct diagnoses may negatively influence the choice of appropriate forensic psychiatric care. Early assessment of those disorders might have a positive influence on the psychological development and socialization process in people with dyslexia and/or AD/HD."}, {"Title": "Post-traumatic stress disorder: the chameleon of psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been included in the DSM category of psychiatric diagnoses since 1980, classified as an anxiety disorder.

The concept of 'intentionality' is introduced as a mark of human action, and a traditional philosophical distinction between the causal explanation of movements and the 'empathetic' understanding of intentional actions is examined. It is argued that this distinction creates difficulties for the explanation of mental disorder. Merleau-Ponty's concept of the 'body-subject' is argued to be a way of overcoming these difficulties, by proposing a form of non-eliminativist materialism. Mental disorder is to be seen as a deviant way of 'being-in-the-world', which can be 'understood', but only with difficulty, and where the deviance requires in addition a causal explanation, either in neurophysiological terms or in terms of early development. It is concluded that this offers a way of combining a humanistic approach to psychiatric disorder with full recognition of the role of physical treatments."}, {"Title": "Shifts in the philosophical foundations of psychiatry since Jaspers: implications for psychopathology and psychotherapy.", "Abstract": "Jaspers' AllgemeinePsychopathologie, the General Psychopathology, published in 1923, had a profound influence on the development of psychiatry. Central to it was the attempt to give the new psychiatry a philosophical foundation, the key element in which was the dichotomy between meaningful and causal connections. This dichotomy was superimposed on the earlier mind-body distinction, and both converged on the conclusion that mind and meaning were problematic from the point of view of science. The inevitable splits came to a head in the 1960's, with attacks on the one side by the other: medical psychiatry was attacked for systematically stripping madness of its meaning and hence dehumanising it, while psychoanalysis, the champion of meaning, was rounded upon for being unscientific. At the same time however there was emerging a new paradigm that effectively deconstructed the problematic, namely, the cognitive or information-processing paradigm. This paradigm has made it possible to construct a unified bio-psycho-social science of psychopathology. In psychotherapy, the shift has been away from the view that meaning is non-causal, a matter only of existential significance or of hermeneutic interpretation, towards the working assumption that it is crucially involved in aetiology, as in the new cognitive behaviour therapy paradigm."}, {"Title": "Social welfare policy: social rehabilitation of psychiatric patients in urban China.", "Abstract": "The background of this paper is an empirical research on social rehabilitation of psychiatric patients in a large urban city in China during the post-Mao period, the Beijing Psychiatric Rehabilitation Research.

There are five analytical dimensions: (1) epistemological choices and research paradigms; (2) rehabilitation as an idea; (3) rehabilitation as a social, political and cultural matter; (4) factors of change in the recent history of China; and, finally, (5) mental illness as a personal experience.\nThis presentation leads to a discussion about the multiple similarities between the social welfare of two vulnerable categories of people (i.e. psychiatric patients and the elderly). It also offers, in the specific field of mental illness, a general interpretation of the rapid social changes in urban China.\nThe conclusion is that psychiatric and ageing services are both a product of interaction among various cultural and social-political-economic factors.

Residents grapple with three inherent conflicting duties between their dual roles as physician and learner, as physician and supervisee, and as physician and employee of a training institution. These conflicts must be negotiated at a time of high stress, when residents are plagued with self-doubt, fear, fatigue, and other vulnerabilities that can lead good doctors to make ethically dubious decisions. While such conflicts and stressors are common to residency training in most specialties, they may be heightened in psychiatric residency.

Immediately his colleague Jean-Pierre Falret pointed out that he had already published a description of the same disorder, that he had named \"folie circulaire\" and, on February 14, presented a lecture on the subject to the Academy. Baillarger accused him of plagiarism, contending that Falret had used the two weeks between the two lectures to attribute the main characteristics of la folie \u00e0 double forme to his folie circulaire, whose description now bore little relation to the (very short) previous report that Falret had evoked as proof of his priority. Falret subsequently showed great restraint in the controversy, while Baillarger reiterated and extended his accusations until his death. An objective study of the printed material not only establishes Falret's clear priority, but also demonstrates that Baillarger's accusations of plagiarism are unfounded, as the descriptions of la folie circulaire and la folie \u00e0 double forme differ on many important points, the first being much closer than the second to our present conceptions. Falret's discovery is thus a landmark in the nosology of mental disorders. Contrary to the then-widespread belief in the existence of a single entity--\" mental alienation\"--with several symptomatic manifestations, Falret affirmed that, in psychiatry as in the rest of medicine, separate disease entities existed. While their etiology was still unknown, they could be distinguished by their syndromic expressions and their outcome; on this basis, Falret considered that la folie circulaire was, together with general paralysis, the only true mental disorder so far identified. His principles were subsequently adopted by Kraepelin, whose main nosological concepts, established around 1900, are still in use today. Kraepelin attributed most psychotic manifestations to two diseases, namely dementia praecox (later renamed schizophrenia) and manic-depressive psychosis; the two differed mainly by the progression of the former to a final state of mental deterioration. Falret's folie circulaire was incorporated in the second disease, as one of its many symptomatic forms. It regained its autonomy only in 1966 when Angst and Perris demonstrated the specificity of its heredity and named it bipolar disorder. Recent studies suggest that the boundaries of this disorder extend far beyond those of its classical description. The so-called bipolar spectrum now includes, on the basis of clinical, biological, genetic and therapeutic arguments, the manic and hypomanic, and even purely depressive manifestations of mood disorder. One hundred and fifty years after its inception, Falret's concept of folie circulaire has become one of the main focuses of psychiatric research."}, {"Title": "[Humor as an additional component of psychological and psychiatric diagnostics in children and adolescents: concept of a humor-diagnostic model].", "Abstract": "When looking at humor of children and adolescents from a diagnostic point of view, there exist additional diagnostic possibilities other than the usual assessment methods from child and adolescent psychiatry or psychology. Spontaneous humorous behavior in everyday life and a humorous performance during assessment situations of children can provide a useful basis for further diagnostic considerations. From a developmental point of view it is important to notice what kinds of humor a child is already capable of understanding and of performing towards others. Whilst the actual readiness for cheerfulness contains information concerning the emotional state, the more general readiness for being cheerful renders insight into basic parameters of temperament. To what extent a child uses humor either supportively or destructively, contains information about psychodynamic connections, motivational aspects and active coping strategies. Concerning the diagnostic approach, reports of parents as well as humor tests or hypothesizing methods (e.g. humorous drawings) can be used. Central in using humor as a diagnostic assessment device is the knowledge of humor development and of the relations between psychiatric illnesses and humor."}, {"Title": "Using the literature in developing McGill's guidelines for interactions between residents and the pharmaceutical industry.", "Abstract": "Evidence suggests that the pharmaceutical industry exerts a large influence on residents' education and practice. Yet existing guidelines by professional bodies do not cover the specifics of residents' interactions with the pharmaceutical industry. At the psychiatry residency program of the McGill University Health Center, the authors set out to systematically evaluate areas of concern for residents and to develop guidelines for use by residents during and outside their training. Areas of concern included educational activities, training, fundraising, and other specific resident-industry interactions. In 1998, a committee of residents and faculty systematically evaluated areas of concern and, based on a review of the literature and discussions with experts, in 2000 developed guidelines for use by McGill's psychiatry program residents. The process for guideline development and methods for their implementation in 2001 are described. Education and training of residents on resident-industry interactions were included early in the curriculum. Guidelines were developed to address limitations on fundraising activities; restriction of direct gifts to residents; the appropriateness and awarding of industry fellowships; and the handling of drug samples, meals, and other presentations to residents. While guidelines for residents are useful adjuncts for guiding residents' interactions with the pharmaceutical industry, the authors conclude that they need to be reinforced with education and sensitization by faculty."}, {"Title": "What about psychiatrists' attitude to mentally ill people?", "Abstract": "Firstly, to assess and, secondly, to compare experts' and lay attitudes towards community psychiatry and the respective social distance towards mentally ill people.\nComparison of two representative Swiss samples, one comprising of 90 psychiatrists, the other including 786 individuals of the general population.\nThe psychiatrists' attitude was significantly more positive than that of the general population although both samples have a positive attitude to community psychiatry.

This capacity critically depends on the development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study was conducted to identify the neural circuitry underlying voluntary self-regulation of sadness in healthy girls (aged 8-10). A 2 x 2 factorial design was implemented with Emotion (No Sadness vs. Sadness) and Regulation (No Reappraisal vs. Reappraisal) as factors. In the No Reappraisal conditions, subjects were instructed to react normally to neutral and sad film excerpts whereas in the Reappraisal conditions, subjects were asked to voluntarily suppress any emotional reaction in response to comparable stimuli. A significant interaction of the Emotion and Regulation factors revealed that reappraisal of sad film excerpts was associated with bilateral activations of the lateral PFC (LPFC; Brodmann areas [BA] 9 and 10), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; BA 11), and medial PFC (BA 9 and 10). Significant loci of activations were also detected in the right anterior cingulate cortex (BA 24/32) and right ventrolateral PFC (BA 47). In an identical study previously conducted by our group in adult women [Biol Psychiatry 53 (2003) 502], reappraisal of sad film excerpts was associated with activation of the right OFC (BA 11) and right LPFC (BA 9). The greater number of prefrontal loci of activation found in children relative to adults during voluntary self-regulation of sadness may be related to the immaturity of the prefronto-limbic connections in childhood."}, {"Title": "Disruption of reconsolidation but not consolidation of auditory fear conditioning by noradrenergic blockade in the amygdala.", "Abstract": "Consolidation is a process through which labile memories are made persistent [Science 287 (2000) 248]; [Annu Rev Psychol 55 (2004) 51]. When retrieved, a consolidated memory is rendered labile again and undergoes reconsolidation [Learn Mem 7 (2000) 73]; [Trends Neurosci 26 (2003) 65]). Reconsolidation thus offers the opportunity to manipulate memory after it is formed, and may therefore provide a means of treating intrusive memories associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Reconsolidation is most usually studied using protein synthesis inhibitors, which is not practical in humans. However, the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol impairs consolidation of declarative memory in humans [Science 287 (2000) 248]; [Nature 371 (1994) 702] and consolidation and reconsolidation of inhibitory avoidance learning in rats [Brain Res 368 (1986) 125]; [J Neurosci 19 (1999) 6623]. Here, we show that systemic or intra-amygdala infused propranolol blocks reconsolidation but not consolidation. If the effects on reconsolidation are verified in humans, the results would suggest the possibility that propranolol after memory retrieval might be an effective way of treatment of intrusive memories in PTSD. That the systemic effects of propranolol on reconsolidation are achieved via an action in the amygdala is especially important in light of the fact that PTSD involves alterations in the amygdala [Arch Gen Psychiatry 53 (1996) 380]."}, {"Title": "Use of antibiotics in hospitals in south-western France.", "Abstract": "Data on the use of antibiotics were collected by means of a questionnaire from 49 hospitals in south-western France.

The average use of antibiotics amounted to 402 DDDs per 1000 patient-days and varied between 60 and 734. In acute-care wards, the amount of antibiotic use increased with the size of the hospital: 461 DDDs per 1000 patient-days for group A (<100 beds), 510 DDDs per 1000 patient-days for group B (more than 100 and less then 300 beds) and 676 DDDs per 1000 patient-days for group C (>300 beds). The rate of use differed among different types of hospital areas and varied from 58 for psychiatry departments to more than 1273 DDDs per 1000 patient-days for the infectious diseases departments.

A factor analysis produced two factors. Factor 1 included questions about situations that were obviously biasing (such as working only for the defense). Factor 2 included questions assessing the potential of certain situations to cause bias in experts, or how likely experts thought other experts were to be biased. In general, experts identified only four areas to be overtly biasing. All occurred within situations in which experts worked only for one or the other side of civil or criminal cases.

They are taken in large quantities by athletes and others to increase performance, often with negative long-term health consequences. As a result, in 1991, testosterone was declared a controlled substance. Recently, Brower [K.J. Brower, Anabolic steroid abuse and dependence. Curr. Psychiatry Rep. 4 (2002) 377-387.] proposed a two-stage model of AAS dependence. Users initiate steroid use for their anabolic effects on muscle growth. With continued exposure, dependence on the psychoactive effects of AAS develops. However, it is difficult in humans to separate direct psychoactive effects of AAS from the user's psychological dependence on the anabolic effects of AAS. Thus, studies in laboratory animals are useful to explore androgen reinforcement. Testosterone induces a conditioned place preference in rats and mice, and is voluntarily consumed through oral, intravenous, and intracerebroventricular self-administration in hamsters. Active, gonad-intact male and female hamsters will deliver 1 microg/microl testosterone into the lateral ventricles. Indeed, some individuals self-administer testosterone intracerebroventricularly to the point of death. Male rats develop a conditioned place preference to testosterone injections into the nucleus accumbens, an effect blocked by dopamine receptor antagonists. These data suggest that androgen reinforcement is mediated by the brain. Moreover, testosterone appears to act through the mesolimbic dopamine system, a common substrate for drugs of abuse. Nonetheless, androgen reinforcement is not comparable to that of cocaine or heroin. Instead, testosterone resembles other mild reinforcers, such as caffeine, nicotine, or benzodiazepines. The potential for androgen addiction remains to be determined."}, {"Title": "Self-criticism and social phobia in the US national comorbidity survey.", "Abstract": "This study sought to extend findings from a preliminary clinical investigation [J.

No significant differences in premorbid status were found. Comparison of psychopathology at the time of the first hospitalization between the outcome groups revealed significant differences in lack of spontaneity and hypochondriac-cenestopathic symptoms.

The subjects were inpatients of the psychiatry clinic of Jichi Medical School who were clinical diagnosed with depression and enrolled in the study between June 1, 1997, and June 30, 1999. Of 86 subjects enrolled, 49 exhibited hypochondriac symptoms (\"hypochondriac group\"). Patients in the hypochondriac group tended to be older at diagnosis and admission than those in the \"non-hypochondriac group\". Our findings suggested that symptoms of both hypochondriasis and depression are related to situational, psychological and organizational factors. As many patients consulted health professionals in specialties other than psychiatry, we emphasize that primary-care doctors need to keep the possibility of depression in mind when examining patients. The frequency of delusions associated with depression was higher in the hypochondriac group than in the non-hypochondriac group. We therefore suggest that hypochondriac attitudes are related to the three major diagnostic features in depressive delusions. Many hypochondriac subjects complained of constipation and pain as concrete symptoms, but the sites of hypochondriac symptoms showed considerable variation. In terms of symptoms of pain, however, affected sites were more localized, with many patients reporting headache or lumbago."}, {"Title": "[Neuroanatomy and neurophysiology in schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "Advances in neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques have enabled detailed investigations of the brain pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

A preliminary study found that carers of individuals with anorexia nervosa experience more difficulties and distress than carers of people with psychoses (Treasure et al., [2001]. Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, 36, 343-347). This is the first study to qualitatively investigate the experiences of carers of individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN).\nTwenty carers of individuals with BN were interviewed using a semistructured interview. Interviews were transcribed and the texts analyzed using content analysis to identify themes.\nThe principal themes to emerge were the impact of the discovery of BN on the carer, the ongoing impact of care-giving, coping strategies used by the carer, and the positive impact of the illness for both the carers and the persons in their care.\nBN has a potent impact on carers' lives. This has implications in terms of service provision and future research in this area."}, {"Title": "[Structural dynamics and delinquent behavior].", "Abstract": "Using key concepts of Janzarik's structural-dynamic model, this article describes some of the potential uses of this model in a forensic setting. We will especially take into account that aspect of Janzarik's work from the start of his research in the 1950s through to the late 1990s which particularly addressed forensic questions. Using the example of dynamic Unstetigkeit and structural derailment, the aspect of 'mental content becoming autonomous' will be considered regarding Schuldunfahigkeit. Taking the example of autopraxis, successful and disturbed balance between impulsivity and self-control in personality disorder will be clarified and concerning the concept of self-corruption the self-induced corroboration of dissocial attitudes will be explained. The author considers the user-friendly work of Janzarik to be a fundamental instrument for answering questions in forensic psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Idiopathic psychosyndromes in the sight of Werner Janzarik].", "Abstract": "In the 50 years of his scientific activity Werner Janzarik has also dealt with idiopathic psychosyndromes, the affective and schizophrenic psychoses. Our paper shows that the scientific work of Janzarik has essentially participated in the foundation of a scientific psychopathology of idiopathic psychosyndromes. In this connection Janzarik has used the whole spectrum of methods relevant for psychiatry in a very fruitful manner. It becomes evident that the step by step developed structural-dynamic concept of an anthropologically psychopathology represents today a substantial basis of a scientific psychiatry that presupposes understanding and knowledge of a comprehensive psychiatric experience related to patients. The transfer of his structural-dynamic approach to the idiopathic psychosyndromes turns out to be a new way of synopsis and integrated interpretation of the psychopathological and biological data relevant for psychiatry. His conclusive psychopathological concept certainly has, independently of its importance for psychiatric practice, a value on its own but must not dispense with psychiatric practice. The structural-dynamic design of Janzarik enables as scarcely an other concept manifold concretisations and transformations into empirically verifiable working hypotheses, also in the utilisation for the clinical psychiatry of idiopathic psychosyndromes and in reflecting their diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. The newly again recognisable tendency to a dividing up of our discipline into a somatic and a psychic position, into too much reductionistic and objectifying procedures of a biological psychiatry and one-sided psychonomic, anthropological, psychoanalytic and system-theoretical interpretations, proves the necessity and fruitfulness of the approach of Janzarik and its untimely character in a positive sense of great promise for the future, demonstrated just also in idiopathic psychosyndromes. The structural-dynamic way of consideration of idiopathic psychosyndromes, on the first sight, faced with the scientistic orientation of the contemporary psychiatry, appearing not useful, has meanwhile long ago on a large scale arrived at the research and practice of clinical psychiatry of affective and schizophrenic psychosyndromes."}, {"Title": "Interpersonal appraisals of emotionally distressed persons by anxious and dysphoric individuals.", "Abstract": "Coyne [J.

In the wake of the recent UK Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) advice, we conducted a rapid review of current available information on SSRIs and suicidality (suicidal ideation, self-harm and suicide attempt) in children and adolescents from clinical trials and epidemiological studies. There is insufficient safety information from the randomised controlled trials to confirm a definite association between SSRIs and suicidality. Furthermore, analysis of suicide and antidepressant prescribing trends in three countries and a large case-control study do not support the hypothesis that there is a link between use of SSRIs and death caused by suicide. Regulatory agencies and the media should have strict guidelines for the management of information relating to the treatment of this condition so that clinicians can make properly informed decisions. We suggest clinical guidelines for managing depression in children and adolescents. SSRIs should not be considered for use as first-line treatment in mild or moderate depression of childhood, where psychological interventions such as cognitive behaviour therapy or interpersonal therapy are the mainstay. SSRIs should be considered when there is severe depression that does not respond to psychological interventions; when the child is suicidal and is admitted as an inpatient, is severely depressed or has bipolar depression despite adequate doses of mood-stabilisation agents; or when the child or family prefers pharmacotherapy to psychological interventions and gives informed consent. Local bodies of clinicians or peer groups should agree protocols and acceptable guidelines, taking into consideration the type of patients being assessed, the availability of nonpharmacological intervention, and the benefit-risk ratio of the pharmacological intervention. It is important that parents (and patients when possible) be given accurate information regarding the current controversy over SSRI prescribing. More research into the use of SSRIs in childhood depression is urgently required."}, {"Title": "A third world international health elective for U.S. medical students: the 25-year experience of the State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center.", "Abstract": "The Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health at the State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center instituted a 6-8 weeks third world international health elective for fourth year medical students in 1980. Since that time, some 217 students have participated in a score of third world countries. However, the most popular sites have been India, Kenya and Thailand. The purposes of this elective are to provide fourth year medical students with an opportunity to observe and study the structure and functions of a health care delivery system in a third world country, to provide medical service, and to have a cross-cultural experience. The emphasis in this elective is on public health, preventive medicine and primary care. There are high levels of student competition for this elective. However, interest in it has been affected by world events such as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the recent outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Asia. Recent annual applications for this elective have been twenty-five and more out of a class of two hundred students. Annual acceptance rates vary considerably, ranging from as low as 27.2% in 1995-1996 to a high of 81.8% in 1987-1988. Careful screening, including an examination of academic records and personal interviews, has resulted in the selection of highly mature, adaptable, and dedicated students who overall have performed well at overseas sites. Student rated satisfaction levels with this elective are extremely high, with most rating it the best experience of their medical school years. Students undergo extensive preparation prior to going overseas. This includes individual health and safety issues, travel and lodging, and the nature of the host country culture, health care system, and assignment site. Our students are especially experienced in cross-cultural understanding because of the unusual diversity of the patients they treat in Brooklyn, and the ethnic diversity of local hospital staff and the medical school class. This Brooklyn experience in cross-cultural understanding has been cited by many participants as having been the best preparation for functioning in a foreign culture. In the late 1990s, we revised our procedures concerning health preparations so as to address the risk of HIV/AIDS and other blood borne diseases. In addition, we also adopted an Agreement and Release form containing 15 provisions requiring risk and responsibility assumption on the part of the student participants. The Alumni Fund of the College of Medicine has steadfastly supported this elective with both a philosophical commitment and financial grants to help defray travel costs. In 1998, Joshua H. Weiner of the class of 1941 created a sizeable endowment in the Alumni Fund of the College of Medicine to support students participating in this elective. In 2001, Sonja K. Binkhorst, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Downstate Medical Center, arranged for some financial support for women medical students through the LSK Foundation and the American Medical Women's Association. During the years that this elective has been offered, overseas preceptors have willingly given of their time and institutional resources to make these experiences available and meaningful for students."}, {"Title": "Chronobiotic protocol and circadian sleep propensity index: new tools for clinical routine and research on melatonin and sleep.", "Abstract": "Twenty years ago, chronobiology was a major topic in medical research, especially in psychiatry. Over time, however, clinicians lost interest in the subject because studies had failed to lead to any practical benefits for patient diagnosis or therapy. Today, the field of chronobiology appears to be on the verge of a renaissance. Over the past decade, our understanding of the basic mechanisms of the circadian timing system (CTS) has increased so rapidly that experts in the field sometimes speak of a \"clockwork explosion.\" It has become apparent that, in order to treat circadian rhythm disturbances, new diagnostic tools are needed so that researchers and physicians can make reliable measurements of CTS functionality (e.g., phase position and circadian rhythm amplitude). Although clinicians do have a phase marker for the CTS at their disposal, there are still no reliable markers for CTS output strength as measured by rhythm amplitude. The amplitude is considered to be the most important factor in CTS output because it determines the degree of temporal organization in human and animal physiology. In this paper, we would like to suggest that circadian sleep propensity (CSP) - the endogenously generated 24-hour variation in the drive to wakefulness and sleep - is the product of all circadian rhythms, serving the human brain at night by assisting it in the production of good-quality sleep. If this is indeed the case, developing a CSP index (CSPI) for use in routine polysomnography would be of great value. In addition, we will review current data on melatonin and its relationship to sleep, basing our analysis on the assumption that melatonin is a circadian hormone and a drug with highly time-dependent effects. Because of this special mode of action, future melatonin studies should employ a special chronobiotic protocol that precludes the use of crossover designs and requires outcome measures different from those used in studies on classical hypnotics."}, {"Title": "[Eating disorders in a historical perspective].", "Abstract": "Disordered eating has been known since antiquity and is mentioned in medical journals as well as in popular literature. The holy anorectics in the Middle Ages wanted to achieve spiritual perfection, while the anorectics of today are seeking bodily perfection. Hilde Bruch and Mara Selvini Palazzoli were the first to focus on anorectic symptoms like leanness and body image disturbance. The breakthrough in clinical and scientific work on bulimia nervosa came around 1980, primarily due to Russell's achievements. In 1874, Sir William Gull was the first to use anorexia nervosa as a diagnosis, while bulimia nervosa was first used in 1979. In the history of Norwegian psychiatry, several psychiatric disorders were described at an early stage, yet eating disorders have only been discussed in the scientific literature from the 1980s and onwards. Eating disorders have now become a cause of concern on the part of health authorities; their policy is to improve clinical skills at all levels rather than to build up specialised clinics."}, {"Title": "Denny-Brown, Boston City Hospital, and the history of American neurology.", "Abstract": "Harvard University's Neurological Unit at Boston City Hospital (BCH) became the premier center for neurological training in the United States during the middle part of the 20th century.

In primary care, the difference increased over time, such that by 2000, 78% of visits to female primary care physicians were from women, compared with 56% for male primary care physicians (P <0.01). Female primary care physicians saw younger patients (mean age, 45 vs. 49 years, P = 0.04), reported longer visits (19 vs. 17 minutes, P <0.01), and reported performing more preventive services than did male primary care physicians when seeing female patients, including Papanicolaou testing (11% vs. 4.7%, P <0.01) and mammograms (9% vs. 4%, P <0.01).\nThe phenomenon of sex concordance between patient and physician has increased in recent years, particularly in primary care.

To what extent? Who in the end was responsible? Sterilization practices targeted underpriviledged people first. The mentally retarded and women were their first victims. Operations were very frequently determined by other people's manipulative or coercive influences. Should the blame be put on the Social-Democrats in power throughout the period (except in Finland and Estonia)? Apart from Denmark, perhaps, local physicians and local services, more than governments, seemed to have strongly supported sterilization practices. Teetotalers and feminists shared responsibilities. How can one explain that eugenics finally declined? Based on a sound application of the Hardy-Weinberg law, the science of the eugenicists was correct. Was it politics? But uncovering of the Nazi crimes had only a very small impact on eugenics. Some authors underline the fact that the Nordic scientific institutions were particularly suited to liberal values. Others point to the devastating effect on eugenics once hereditarist psychiatry fell from favour in the middle of the sixties."}, {"Title": "Mapping medical careers: questionnaire assessment of career preferences in medical school applicants and final-year students.", "Abstract": "The medical specialities chosen by doctors for their careers play an important part in the workforce planning of health-care services.

In this study, we use three large-scale cohorts of medical students to produce maps of medical careers.\nInformation on between 24 and 28 specialities was collected in three UK cohorts of medical students (1981, 1986 and 1991 entry), in applicants (1981 and 1986 cohorts, N = 1135 and 2032) or entrants (1991 cohort, N = 2973) and in final-year students (N = 330, 376, and 1437). Mapping used Individual Differences Scaling (INDSCAL) on sub-groups broken down by age and sex. The method was validated in a population sample using a full range of careers, and demonstrating that the RIASEC structure could be extracted.\nMedical specialities in each cohort, at application and in the final-year, were well represented by a two-dimensional space. The representations showed a close similarity to Holland's RIASEC typology, with the main orthogonal dimensions appearing similar to Prediger's derived orthogonal dimensions of 'Things-People' and 'Data-Ideas'.\nThere are close parallels between Holland's general typology of careers, and the structure we have found in medical careers. Medical specialities typical of Holland's six RIASEC categories are Surgery (Realistic), Hospital Medicine (Investigative), Psychiatry (Artistic), Public Health (Social), Administrative Medicine (Enterprising), and Laboratory Medicine (Conventional).

Although P50 suppression is thought to be related to symptomatology, this is yet to be shown. The failure to demonstrate this relation has led some to argue that P50 suppression and symptomatology are not related. However, a possible confound has recently been corroborated [i.e., chronic smoking is related to superior P50 suppression [Crawford et al., Neuroscience Letters 317 (2002) 151]], and a relation has been found in questionnaire-defined individuals with indications of schizotypy [i.e., psychometric schizotypy is related to poor P50 suppression [Croft et al., Biological Psychiatry 50 (2001) 441]]. The present study attempted to replicate and extend both studies by examining P50 suppression, smoking histories, psychometric schizotypy and NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-V) scores in 37 healthy participants. Replicating Crawford et al., P50 suppression was better in the heavier smokers. Providing a partial replication of Croft et al., P50 suppression was inversely related to schizotypy scores in participants who smoked little or not at all; however, P50 suppression was positively related to schizotypy in heavier smokers. Covarying for age and NEO-V scale scores had little effect on these relations. The findings provide evidence of important confounds that would limit our ability to detect P50 suppression/symptom relations in schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Geriatric patients improve as much as younger patients from hospitalization on general psychiatric units.", "Abstract": "To determine whether geriatric patients aged 65 and older on general adult psychiatric units improve as much as younger patients, over what duration their improvement occurs, and their risk of readmission.\nCohort study.\nInpatient psychiatric unit of an urban, university-affiliated, county hospital from January 1993 through August 1999.\nA total of 5,929 inpatients.\nStandardized, routine assessments by attending psychiatrists included the Psychiatric Symptom Assessment Scale (PSAS) on admission and discharge. Discharge scores, length of stay (LOS), and risk of readmission within 1 year were modeled for the groups using multiple regression analyses.\nGeriatric patients constituted 5% (n=299) of the 5,929 admissions. In multivariate analysis, geriatric status was not associated with discharge PSAS scores. Median LOS was longer for geriatric patients (16 days) than younger patients (10 days, P<.001), especially in older women (14 days) and geriatric patients with mild medical illness severity (13 days vs 11 days in those with moderate-to-severe medical illness). Geriatric patients were as likely to be readmitted within 1 year of discharge as younger patients.\nGeriatric patients on general inpatient psychiatry units improved as much as younger patients. Their longer LOS was associated with milder medical illness severity.

In an attempt to address this difficulty, this paper will present a framework that can serve as an accessible introduction to the ethical issues in psychiatry. Reflecting upon general, clinical examples from psychiatric practice, it will be suggested that many ethical issues in psychiatry are concerned with acts of paternalism and with the common justification for those acts. Having presented this framework, the paper will then subject it to a preliminary critique by drawing upon contemporary, critical approaches to health care ethics. It is hoped that this will serve to stimulate both a deeper appreciation of the relevance of ethics to the practice of mental health nursing and an ongoing critical consideration of the ethical issues in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Conversion pseudodementia in older people: a descriptive case series.", "Abstract": "This paper reports a case series of ten patients collected over a 12-year period of clinical work in old age psychiatry in the UK by the author.\nThe core features of the syndrome are: apparent cognitive impairment, regression and increasing physical dependency beginning in late middle or early old age, without evidence for an organic dementia from investigations or from taking into account the course of the illness. The syndrome is more common in women from a higher socio-economic background with past psychiatric histories dominated by depressive symptoms. The syndrome usually progresses to the point where long term institutional care is needed although the mean survival from onset is 13 years.\nThe author suggests that conversion pseudodementia in older people is caused by a catastrophic reaction to cumulative loss in later life in individuals who have predisposing borderline and narcissistic personality traits.

The uro-gynaecological clinical symptoms and diseases refer to the following syndromes: irritable bladder, recurrent cystitis, interstitial cystitis, urinary retention and forms of incontinence. In view of the great aetiological importance of depression and its psycho-neuroendocrine associations with urge symptoms correlating with oestrogen deficiency, the option of employing newer approaches, and also psychopharmacological approaches, must be considered. In the pathogenesis, the stress and conflict model offers approaches to explanation and treatment. The psychosomatically oriented diagnosis and treatment of symptoms and disorders of the lower urinary tract in women is primarily the task of the gynaecologist, who has to go beyond investigations for organic diseases and must also clarify and treat the psychological dimensions.

This psychiatric organization consists of three clinical programs-an outpatient clinic and intensive day and evening programs-and an integral evaluation and research unit. The PPS is unique in its group therapy clinical orientation, its psychodynamic theoretical orientation, and its integration of an ongoing research program that establishes empirical validation of its clinical work. The productivity and longevity of this psychiatric organization appear to derive from several strengths, including cooperation between leaders of the clinical and research programs; the institution of staff relations groups in the three clinical programs; the operation of the fully integrated evaluation and research program that serves to provide empirical support for the treatments offered; and a unifying ideology characterized by the valuing of both psychodynamic and group oriented work. Other important factors to the success of the PPS include the strengths of the founder of the service and financial and other support of the academic department in which it is housed. This paper describes the historical development and present structure and functioning of the PPS, the challenges it has been confronted with, and the responses to those challenges.

This paper is an early manifesto of their ideas and sets the context for the following publications, namely Hecker's seminal paper on hebephrenia to be published in the same journal and in the same year (1871) and Kahlbaum's catatonia published in 1874. Their idea that age of onset and time course of an illness, together with close clinical observation, helps to delineate disease forms out of the mass of confusing psychiatric symptoms proved to be one of the most important paradigm shifts in middle to late nineteenth-century psychiatry. This had a strong influence on Kraepelin's dichotomy between dementia praecox and manic depressive insanity, and thus on our modern notions of schizophrenia and bipolar illness."}, {"Title": "The sin in the aetiological concept of Johann Christian August Heinroth (1773-1843).

The present two-part paper investigates what exactly Heinroth understood by sin. Based on a thorough analysis of his own texts, this study shows that on the one hand Heinroth referred to sin in a Christian-Protestant sense.

Logistic regression analyses generated predictive models of primary care residency choice, including family medicine, general internal medicine, and pediatrics for 555 medical school graduates over five years.\nVariables predictive of primary care residency choice were gender; student ratings of psychiatry, surgery, and internal medicine clerkships; not having participated in a research project in medical school; attitudes toward \"the changing health care system on physicians\" and \"access to medical care\"; and planned practice in a medically underserved area. Results differed for each field within each residency choice.\nThe Bland-Meurer Model may be used for variable selection in multivariate predictive models of family medicine, internal medicine and pediatrics residency choice.

Two hundred and sixty-one patients aged 60 and older of an internal medicine hospital previously examined between 1994 and 1997 were once more contacted five years later. One hundred and sixty-four patients could not be included in the present investigation because of death, dementia, or severe physical illness. Of the 97 patients eligible for this second investigation, 74 agreed to participate. They were investigated extensively by means of psychometric scales and diagnostic interviews. A positive selection effect could be found for the sample of the present investigation with regard to age and health-related variables. Subjective evaluation of health correlated highly with the self-evaluation scales that recorded subjective well-being (life satisfaction, anxiety, and depression), and with the sense of coherence, but not substantially with objective health-related variables. A backward regression resulted in an adjusted R2 = 0.33 for the three retained variables \"subjective physical complaints\", \"sense of coherence\" and \"self-evaluated depression\" which rendered the same variance clarification of subjective health as did the model including all variables. Since the elderly represent the majority of patients treated in general hospitals and as subjective health and subjective physical complaints influence frequency of medical consultations and health care utilization, this is an important issue for consultation-liaison-psychiatry and health policy."}, {"Title": "Clinical comparison of extended-release divalproex versus delayed-release divalproex: pooled data analyses from nine trials.", "Abstract": "Divalproex sodium is an effective anticonvulsant, antimanic, and migraine prophylaxis agent.

Divalproex ER was associated with superior tolerability with less frequent tremor, weight gain, and gastrointestinal complaints (all P<0.001), but not less hair loss. Divalproex ER also yielded improved seizure control and greater improvement of psychiatric symptoms, and was greatly preferred by patients over divalproex DR.

Repeat users were defined as those individuals receiving two or more inpatient admissions to Walter Reed Army Medical Center during the study period. Statistical comparisons were made between repeat and single admission groups to identify variables predictive of rehospitalization.\nOf 814 individual patients under study, 117 (14%) were identified as repeat users. A history of childhood psychiatric problems, previous psychiatric hospitalization, current or past substance abuse, legal problems, and presence of a psychotic or nonbipolar mood disorder were associated with readmission after controlling for active duty status. Current comorbid substance use or personality disorder diagnoses were not predictive. Having at least one child was protective against readmission. The 117 repeat users accounted for 3,838 (37%) of the total 10,393 hospital bed-days during the study period. Logistic regression analysis of all variables correlated with readmission demonstrated statistical significance for past psychiatric hospitalization and age of onset of psychiatric problems before age 18 when active duty status, age, and gender variables were included in the equation.\nThis study is one of the largest to investigate predictors of rehospitalization in a population that enjoys universal \"free\" access to comprehensive mental health care services and other benefits of employment. This retrospective analysis documented three important facts: That there seem to be only minor differences between military and civilians with respect to variables associated with psychiatric rehospitalization, that a relatively small proportion of patients accounted for a disproportionately large number of inpatient bed-days, and that an unexpectedly high proportion of active duty patients admitted to this study site reported childhood psychiatric problems and psychiatric hospitalizations before their first hospitalization at Walter Reed Army Medical Center."}, {"Title": "[Near-infrared spectroscopy in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive optical method for in vivo measurement of regional brain tissue oxygenation. Light from the near-infrared spectrum can penetrate the skull and is mainly absorbed by oxyhaemoglobin (O(2)Hb) and desoxyhaemoglobin (HHb). From the amount of reflected near-infrared light in relation to the amount absorbed by brain tissue, regional changes in O(2)Hb and HHb concentrations can be calculated spectrophotometrically. It has been shown that NIRS is not only able to measure massive disturbances in cerebral blood circulation due to serious neurological diseases, but that it also is sensitive enough to assess task-specific patterns of activation in healthy subjects during circumscribed cognitive processes. Preliminary investigations indicate altered regional brain tissue oxygenation in psychiatric patients during cognitive activation tasks. The NIRS outmatches other functional imaging methods in that it has no side effects and is well tolerated by psychiatric patients. Furthermore, it can be applied quickly and easily. Thus, NIRS is a potential screening method in psychiatric settings, provided that robust parameters of reliable diagnostic and/or prognostic value can be developed for individual psychiatric illnesses. However, this will depend on broader application of the method combined with established neurophysiological procedures and functional imaging techniques in psychiatric research."}, {"Title": "Neuropsychiatry: a management model for academic medicine.", "Abstract": "Neuropsychiatry has become the subject of a number of editorials and position papers in recent years.

This review examines the role of TMS in schizophrenia research as a diagnostic and a therapeutic resource. After a brief overview of TMS, we describe the application of TMS to schizophrenia in studies of cortical excitability and inhibition, and we discuss the potential confounding role of neuroleptic medications. Based on these studies, it appears that some impairment of cortical inhibition may be present in schizophrenic subjects. We then review attempts to employ TMS for treating different symptoms of schizophrenia. Some encouraging results have been obtained, such as the reduction of auditory hallucinations after slow TMS over auditory cortex and an improvement of psychotic symptoms after high frequency TMS over left prefrontal cortex. However, these results need to be confirmed using better placebo conditions. Future studies are likely to employ TMS in combination with functional brain imaging to examine the effects produced by the stimulated area on activity in other brain regions. Such studies may reveal impaired effective connectivity between specific brain areas, which could identify these regions as targets for selective stimulation with therapeutic doses of TMS."}, {"Title": "Healing psychiatry: a pragmatic approach to bridging the science/humanism divide.", "Abstract": "Competing urges to think of human mental suffering as comprehensible and susceptible to scientific formulation, or as deeply complex and beyond the reach of scientific analysis, have torn at the fabric of psychiatry for many years and have left the field conceptually divided between science and humanism. Conceptual reparation of psychiatry is now a core mission of a field that is trying to heal itself so that it is equipped to heal the patients it serves. To formulate their cases comprehensively and provide patients with cutting-edge care, psychiatrists must heal the conceptual wounds that have resulted from dividing the human individual into an object of scientific scrutiny and a subject of personal experience. They must synthesize science and humanism in order to generate new understanding of mental disorders and to train future clinicians and researchers. Principles of classical American pragmatism, I argue in this article, can help to transcend the science/humanism divide in psychiatry. Clinical pragmatism focuses on favorable treatment outcomes by respecting the practical, pluralistic, participatory, and provisional aspects of psychiatric care. It demands that psychiatrists have the skill and flexibility to use multiple explanatory concepts in a collaborative, open-ended process with their patients. These themes are explored from the perspectives of contemporary psychiatric treatment, training, and research."}, {"Title": "Size and complexity of social networks among substance abusers: childhood and current correlates.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to identify parental, childhood, demographic, and social function factors associated with social network size and complexity among substance abusers using retrospective data regarding family and childhood history and current data regarding demographic characteristics and psychosocial function. The authors interviewed 505 voluntary patients with substance abuse at two university medical centers in Minnesota and Oklahoma with alcohol-drug programs located within departments of psychiatry. Data collection instruments included a childhood questionnaire, a demographic checklist, and two psychiatric rating scales of psychosocial function. The authors found that years of education, current residence with others, being actively occupied at work or school, and higher psychosocial function on two psychiatrist-rated scales were associated with increased social network size and complexity. Loss of mother, out-of-home placement, and runaway before age 18 were associated with smaller social networks in adulthood. Age, gender, and current marital status were not associated with social network. Regression analysis indicated that network size (i.e., the number of individuals in the network) was associated with higher psychosocial function over the last year but not over the last two weeks, whereas network complexity (ie, the number of subgroups in the network) was related to psychosocial function over both the last year and the last two weeks. These data indicate that in addicted persons, both childhood factors and current social factors affect network size and complexity. Network complexity may be amenable to short-term change, whereas network size may be more related to longer-term coping."}, {"Title": "The significance of addressing trauma in outpatient psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Establishing post-traumatic stress disorder as a psychiatric diagnosis has only marginally increased awareness of traumatic experiences. Traumas are inconsistently recorded in initial psychiatric histories and, when observed, rarely reflected in the primary diagnosis and treatment. The present study aimed to investigate if there is an association between sufficiently addressing trauma and long-term outcome and what factors affect whether trauma, according to the patient's view, is sufficiently addressed or not. Socio-demographic data, experiences of trauma and treatment, and outcome, were collected retrospectively from Arabic, Iranian, Turkish and Swedish patients, who had visited a psychiatric clinic 3-4 years earlier. Fifty-one patients whose traumatic experiences had been sufficiently addressed were compared with 39 patients who perceived that their traumas had not been addressed. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine relationships between clinical variables and whether or not traumas had been addressed. Patients with trauma sufficiently addressed reported high confidence in staff (odds ratio, OR=7.2, p<0.001), high self-rated health (OR=8.0, p<0.01) and low scores on the Self-rating Inventory for PTSD (OR=7.7, p<0.05) and Depression Scale (OR=3.0, p<0.15). Reporting less than five different traumas (OR=4.6, p<0.01) and being an ethnic Swede (OR=2.4, p<0.10) were the background variables independently related to having trauma sufficiently addressed. Addressing trauma may improve patients' confidence in staff, self-rated health and trauma-related symptoms.

Nevertheless, these theories continue to be widely promoted. One explanation that has been offered for continued adherence to questionable theory is that it stimulates and gives direction to research. The heuristic value of theory is examined in the present paper by tracing the discoveries that followed from an old theory of schizophrenia, which is--by current consensus--false.

Australian and international experience is reviewed.\nThe paper finds that the clinical and the legal narratives about how to 'define' mental illness do differ at the formal level of expression where they necessarily intersect in the setting of tribunal review of involuntary treatment decisions.

The connections between the proposed condition and the desire to die are analysed in the context of the continuing tensions surrounding the ontological status and sociopolitical implications of psychiatric categories and the pervasive medicalization of modern life.\nThe analysis suggests that by medicalizing existential cognitions at the end of life, the proposed diagnostic category also normalizes a particular moral view concerning assistance in dying.\nWhile further research into the issues described in this provisional syndrome may benefit some patients, the categorization of demoralization as a medical diagnosis is a questionable extension of psychiatry's influence, which could serve particular social, political and cultural views concerning the end of life."}, {"Title": "[The choice of profession of medical doctors graduating from Leiden University].", "Abstract": "To determine what postgraduate courses Leiden medical students had completed after obtaining the degree in medicine.\nDescriptive.\nThe BIG-register [Dutch register of professionals in individual healthcare] was examined to determine how students who had passed their final examinations at Leiden University in 199o or in 1995 were registered at the beginning of February 2004.

Despite his theoretical concepts being thoroughly investigated by medical historians, the fact that his scientific work also brought him in contact with Weimar poet and scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749 - 1832) has up to now not been acknowledged. This paper analyses for the first time the manifold points of contact between the two geniuses. Starting off with a retrospective on Goethe's relationship towards psychiatry in his day, this paper investigates the mutual interconnections and influences between the two. This is achieved by an analysis of yet unknown primary sources as well as Goethe's literary and scientific works. A main emphasis is also placed on Heinroth's Textbook of Anthropology of 1822 in which the psychiatrist laid out his understanding of 'relational thinking' (gegenst\u00e4ndliches Denken), a key concept for both. This theory developed from Heinroth's dealing with Goethe's concept of \"anschauung\" and was to gain major importance not only for his way of gaining knowledge in general but also for his psychiatric concept. Goethe's influence on Heinroth is particularly revealed in the latter's holistic views on mental illnesses. Heinroth's visit to Goethe on 15 September 1827 can be earmarked as a sign of their mutual esteem."}, {"Title": "Vascular neurology: a new neurologic subspecialty.", "Abstract": "This article presents information about the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology's new subspecialty certificate in vascular neurology, including the requirements for board certification.

However, participation of patients and their families in the treatment process, and co-operation between them and the professionals, are also important. Communication between the professionals, patients and their family members, and the professionals is a crucial factor for co-operation.\nThe aim of this study was to elucidate the experiences and importance of co-operation for the patients. The data consisted of interviews with 22 mental health patients who were also clients of municipal social services.\nThe grounded theory approach was used, focusing on the informants' experiences of the integrated network and family-oriented model for co-operation.\nThe findings indicate the importance of the participation of patients and their social networks in psychiatric care or the treatment process. Meetings should be characterized by open and reflexive discussions with all participants' points of view being included, so that fruitful co-operation is possible. However, some negative experiences were also reported, all of which were connected with the professionals' behaviour.\nTrust and honesty are essential elements in relations between professionals and psychiatric patients, but it cannot be assumed that they will develop naturally. It is the professionals' responsibility to adjust their behaviour so that these elements can be created in a mutual process between patients and professionals. Multidisciplinary teams are a necessity in family-oriented co-operation between psychiatry and social services, and in a satisfactory caring process.\nNurses' work is often individually oriented and nurses are ruled by routines in their work. The mental health caring process should be seen as a shared process between the patient, his/her human environment and professionals for which nurses need skills to their interaction with patients and their social network."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatric training of nurses in the Netherlands since 1883].", "Abstract": "This article describes the development since 1883 of training nurses for working with psychiatric patients. Knowledge of this development seems to throw a new light upon the nursing history in the Netherlands. To start with, the vocational training system in psychiatric hospitals developed during exactly the same time as the hospital based educational system for so called ' general nurses'. As a result, both these vocational training routes were acknowledged as 'basic learning routes for nurses' in the Dutch Nursing Law of 1921. The general route gave to Diploma A, the psychiatric route gave access to Diploma B. This double diploma system placed the Dutch training system for nurses in an isolated position. For most other countries - as well as the International Council of Nurses - considered psychiatry as a field of work in which a nurse could specialise only after having completed a basic training programme as a general nurse. In most countries, the specialization course in psychiatry only took one year. In comparison to those systems, the Dutch programme seemed to offer psychiatric nurses more years of specific training. After World War II, however, also in the Netherlands many people advocated a one diploma system in nursing, with possibilities to specialise. Nevertheless, it took the Dutch until 1997 to introduce this new system, so it seems the old training routes were defended vehemently. Maybe an historic description of the way this psychiatric route had developed, can shed new light upon the aspects of the old educational system that one longed to preserve."}, {"Title": "End-of-life care: issues relevant to the geriatric psychiatrist.", "Abstract": "Most deaths in the United States occur in the context of chronic diseases in later life and are too often accompanied by potentially remediable emotional or physical suffering. Geriatric psychiatrists and other mental health professionals can contribute meaningfully to the provision of optimal care during the final phases of life. This review provides an overview of end-of-life care, focusing on issues most relevant to the geriatric psychiatrist. The author examined palliative care textbooks and review papers to determine the topics to be included in this article, and searched computerized literature databases on these topics. Many of the recommendations provided herein stem from experts' clinical experience; however empirical evidence is also incorporated and critiqued. Topics covered include conversations with patients and families about end-of-life care; the evaluation and treatment of suffering, including pain, depression, suicidality, anxiety, and delirium; the role of individual and family therapies in caring for dying patients; capacity determination; advance care planning; withholding life-sustaining treatments; and \"last resort\" (and, in some cases, quite controversial) options, such as terminal sedation, assisted suicide, and euthanasia. The author also notes the relevance of such end-of-life-care considerations to patients with dementia. Geriatric psychiatrists' skills across these multiple domains are of particular usefulness. Through such clinical skills and the application of empirical research tools to the many unanswered questions in the care of dying patients, geriatric psychiatry can make increasingly valuable and visible contributions to improving quality of life for people suffering from life-threatening illnesses."}, {"Title": "Factor structure and reliability of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire in a Canadian undergraduate student sample.", "Abstract": "The aims of this study were to examine (1) the psychometric properties of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire [CTQ; Bernstein, D., Fink, L., Handelsman, L., Foote, J., Lovejoy, M., Wenzel, K., Sapareto, E., & Ruggiero, J.

The author reviews historical, legislative, and contemporary psychiatric perspectives on infanticide and discusses ways in which the psychiatric community can improve prevention of infanticide and promote appropriate treatment of mentally ill women who commit infanticide.\nThe case of Texas v. Andrea Yates, involving a mother with mental illness who drowned her five children, is used to illustrate society's complicated reactions to infanticide in the context of postpartum mental illness.\nIn the United States, the complexity of the response to infanticide is demonstrated by the judicial system's reaction to such cases. Whereas England's Infanticide Law provides probation and mandates psychiatric treatment for mothers with mental illness who commit infanticide, \"killer mothers\" may face the death penalty in the United States. Contemporary neuroscientific findings support the position that a woman with postpartum psychosis who commits infanticide needs treatment rather than punishment and that appropriate treatment will deter her from killing again. Psychiatrists have a vital role in recognizing the signs and symptoms of peripartum psychiatric disorders, particularly postpartum psychosis, and in early identification of and intervention with at-risk mothers.\nThe absence of formal DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for postpartum psychiatric disorders promotes disparate treatment under the law. The psychiatric community should develop guidelines for the treatment of postpartum disorders, foster sharing of knowledge between psychiatry and the law, and do more to enlighten society about the effects of mental illness on thought and behavior so that decisions about the treatment and punishment of mentally ill persons will not be left exclusively in the hands of the judicial system."}, {"Title": "[The change in medical practice.

Trained psychiatry interns administered the 2.1 version of the OCD section of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). The 12-month period prevalence rate of OCD was 3.0%. The mean age of onset of OCD was 25.9 +/- 12.5 (range, 7 to 63) years. The prevalence rate of OCD was slightly higher among females (males 2.5%, females 3.3%), but the difference was not statistically significant. The relative risk for divorced, separated, or widowed subjects was approximately 4.2 times higher for OCD than others (2.7% v 10.5%). The 1-year prevalence of OCD inversely related to age group in male subjects, but increased with age in female subjects. The prevalence rate of OCD was not different by the level of education, except it was statistically higher among subjects who were literate but had no schooling, of which the causal relationship was high prevalence rate of OCD among female literate-but no schooling subjects. Subjects with few (one or two) and more siblings (seven or more) had a significantly higher prevalence rate of OCD than subjects with moderate numbers of siblings (three to six). No significant difference was found according to employment, fertility, birth order, and income of the subjects. About 30% of subjects with OCD had only obsessions, whereas 68.5% had both obsessions and compulsions. Only one subject (1.1%) with OCD met compulsion criteria without obsessions.

The authors cite factors promoting disclosure, such as the ideal of patient autonomy, possibilities for psychoeducation and collaboration with the patient toward more specific and effective therapies, and the increasing availability of diagnostic information available to patients from sources other than their clinicians.\nThere are compelling reasons to make the diagnosis the subject of open examination and discussion between clinician and patient, and reasons to believe that disclosure would serve to advance the patient in his or her recovery."}, {"Title": "Reflections on psychodynamic psychotherapy supervision for psychiatrists in clinical practice.", "Abstract": "Much has been written about psychotherapy supervision for trainees in psychiatry. Psychiatrists are also encouraged to receive supervision when dealing with difficult patients or when involved in personal events that have the potential to have an impact on their psychotherapeutic work. Nevertheless, a literature search, conducted through Medline, revealed few publications dealing with supervision of psychiatrists who conduct psychotherapy in clinical settings after completion of training. This article discusses the issues involved in psychotherapy supervision for the supervisor, supervised psychiatrists, and their practice settings and patients. The author first discusses the benefits of psychotherapy supervision for psychiatrists in clinical practice, including helping psychiatrists maintain and improve psychotherapeutic skills, assistance in dealing with patients who have complex or especially challenging problems (e.g., personality disorders, intractable depression, difficulties with compliance, complex psychosocial problems), addressing ethical concerns, boundary issues, and transference and countertransference, and helping psychiatrists deal with personal issues that may cause difficulties in providing psychotherapy or issues that arise in working with a multidisciplinary team. The author then reviews key issues related to the supervisory process, including group versus individual supervision, the role of the supervisor, different supervisory styles, and factors that can contribute to feelings of shame or vulnerability in the supervisee. The author also discusses different supervisory styles, clarifies the distinction between therapy and supervision, and discusses issues that arise in the supervision of experienced psychodynamic therapists. Barriers that may keep psychiatrists from seeking psychotherapy supervision are reviewed.

This CPG covers anorexia nervosa (AN).\nThe CGP team consulted with scientists, clinicians, carers and consumer groups in meetings of over 200 participants and conducted a systematic review of meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials and other studies.\nIt is extremely difficult to draw general conclusions about the efficacy of specific treatment options for AN. There are few controlled clinical trials and their quality is generally poor. These guidelines necessarily rely largely upon expert opinion and uncontrolled trials. A multidimensional approach is recommended. Medical manifestations of the illness need to be addressed and any physical harm halted and reversed. Weight restoration is essential in treatment, but insufficient evidence is available for any single approach. A lenient approach is likely to be more acceptable to patients than a punitive one and less likely to impair self-esteem. Dealing with the psychiatric problems is not simple and much controversy remains. For patients with less severe AN who do not require in-patient treatment, out-patient or day-patient treatment may be suitable, but this decision will depend on availability of such services. Family therapy is a valuable part of treatment, particularly for children and adolescents, but no particular approach emerges as superior to any other.

We studied the incidence of SSPE in Bulgaria based on cases admitted to the Child Neurology Clinic, University Hospital of Neurology and Psychiatry, Sofia, for a 25-year period (1978-2002). The SSPE incidence prior to and during the period of routine measles immunization was analyzed. SSPE was diagnosed in 40 children (29 males and 11 females, mean age 8.5 years), 28 from 1978 to 1984 (average 4 patients/year), and 12 from 1995 to 2002 (average 1.7 patients/year). Thirty-eight cases (95%) were non-immunized and had early measles infection. Age at onset of SSPE ranged from 8 to 11 years (52.5%) with a mean latent period of 7 years following measles infection. The increase in SSPE incidence (1995-2002) following a 10-year disease-free period (1985-1994) appears to be related to early measles infection (mean age 11 months) during the measles epidemic of 1991-1992. During the period 1995-2002, children had earlier measles infection (average 11 months) and earlier onset of SSPE (mean age 8.4 years) than in the period 1978-1984 (mean age at measles infection 18 months, and of SSPE onset 11.2 years).

From 1971 until 1994 he was head of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Kiel. In 1957, while training in neurology and psychiatry, he comprehensively described a case of sebaceous nevus involving the head, with ipsilateral ocular lesions including coloboma of the upper lid, increased density of cranial bones, epileptic seizures and mental retardation. He concluded that this combination of anomalies represented a new 'phacomatosis'. Subsequently this phenotype was reported by other authors under many different names, such as 'Schimmelpenning syndrome', 'Feuerstein-Mims syndrome', 'Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome', 'epidermal nevus syndrome', 'Solomon syndrome', 'linear sebaceous nevus syndrome', 'organoid nevus phacomatosis', or 'Jadassohn nevus phacomatosis'. As a consequence of this confusing terminology, Schimmelpenning syndrome even has two different OMIM entries (no. 163200 and no. 165630).

A range of containment methods are used by psychiatric professionals to keep patients and staff safe. These strategies are strongly emotive and attract strong moral valuations, yet differ sharply between countries. This paper reports a study to investigate the relationship between attitudes to these containment methods, and exposure to psychiatric education and practice. It was hypothesized that the culture of psychiatry in the study country would socialise students' views towards the locally dominant pattern of relative evaluations. Nine cohorts of student psychiatric nurses at different stages of their training at one UK University were asked to complete ratings on 11 containment methods. Containment methods fell into five groups, with mechanical restraint and net beds attracting the most severe disapproval. Neither the relative evaluation of methods, nor the intensity of those evaluations, changed systematically with duration of training. The findings support the interpretation that the relative evaluations of psychiatric containment methods are a property of wider national cultures, rather than an isolated tradition of professional psychiatric practice."}, {"Title": "Therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders: emerging clues from Parkinson's disease.", "Abstract": "Our knowledge of Parkinson's disease pathophysiology has greatly expanded during the last century, resulting in successful new medical and neurosurgical approaches toward this common neurodegenerative disorder.

Using the concept of psychical trauma as a bridge, the author attempts an interdisciplinary dialogue with psychiatry, biology and neuroscience. Beginning with the concept of psychical trauma in Freud, the author reviews the evolution of Freud's thinking, and links it with the ideas of Ferenczi and post-Freudian psychoanalytical authors. From a different framework, he considers the present state of research on post-traumatic stress disorder in current psychiatric nosography and attempts an interdisciplinary approximation to the concept of psychical trauma. Interesting ideas like the traumatic situation, trauma spectrum and psychopathological spectrum emerge, which enable a better understanding of the concept of psychical trauma through its relatedness, as a bridge connecting a broad psychopathological range extending from normality to psychosis. The ensuing possible relative loss of nosographical rigour is more than compensated by the resulting increased understanding and enlarged therapeutic possibilities. In the second part of the paper, the author attempts a dialogue with neuroscience, taking into account new advances in current research on emotion and memory, and making them compatible with the psychoanalytical concept of trauma. In this sense, the paper underlines the importance of emotion and crucially of memory, regarded as a fundamental axis of the subject explored in this paper. Here a substantial distinction which is pertinent for analytical work appears: declarative memories versus non-declarative or procedural memories. In a concluding discussion the author argues that, taking into account the implications of these current notions regarding a number of theoretical and technical aspects, psychoanalysis currently holds a privileged position, both in its potential for prevention and regarding the treatment of patients, in so far as, through interdisciplinary dialogue, psychoanalysis can be receptive to and be enriched by the contributions of other disciplines, just as it enriches them with its own contributions."}, {"Title": "Gender differences in the psychopathology of depressed inpatients.", "Abstract": "In the last few years there has been increased scientific effort to describe the gender-specific psychopathological features of depression.

A psychopathological rating according to the standardized documentation system of the AMDP (Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry) was performed at admission and discharge. At admission into the hospital women tended to show more affective lability (p = 0.025), whereas men had higher scores in affective rigidity (p = 0.032), blunted affect (p = 0.002), decreased libido (p = 0.028), hypochondriasis (p = 0.016) and hypochondriac delusions (p = 0.039). At discharge from the hospital women had significantly higher scores in dysphoria (p = 0.010), while men were more prone to have compulsive impulses (p = 0.030). Although our results were obtained in a selected sample of inpatients at a university hospital, they are indicative of psychopathological differences between men and women in the core symptoms of depression.

Reform in health care financing and its realisation in 2003 introduced a risk of inhibiting further development of mental health care. The endangerment is a result of allocation of resources, which is inadequate to real costs and promotes in-patient treatment. An additional risk is seen in a project of privatisation of health care institutions.

Data relating to emergency medical patients admitted to St James' Hospital Dublin between 1st January and 31st December 2002 was recorded. Of 5038 episodes evaluated, the median LOS was 6 days (IQR 3-13); this was significantly shorter when the patient was admitted under a general medical service (p<0.0001). There was also a positive correlation between patient age and LOS (r = 0.32; p<0.0001). No test request was associated with a shortened LOS. Prolonged LOS was associated with oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy, echocardiography, computerised tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and abdominal ultrasonography testing. Furthermore, prolonged LOS was associated with the following disease related groups (DRG) at discharge; codes related to heart failure, respiratory system, malignancy, stroke, diabetes, psychiatry, and anaemia. We found that clinical coding using the HIPE database strongly predicted hospital LOS for acute general medical admissions. Spare bed capacity is essential if an acute hospital is to operate efficiently and at a level of risk acceptable to patients. Therefore, determining major influences on hospital LOS is valuable, to develop potential strategies to optimise efficient utilization of acute bed capacity."}, {"Title": "Differential effects of fluvoxamine, paroxetine and milnacipran for depression, especially with regard to age.", "Abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and dual serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are the most commonly prescribed classes of antidepressants, yet it is not known whether one is superior to the other.

The true incidence of this discontinuation syndrome is unknown because it may be underreported as a consequence of underrecognition or misattribution. This article examines the possible etiology, nosology, mechanisms, and other aspects of the syndrome.\nA PubMed search was conducted in May 2003 and repeated in January 2004 using the search terms antidepressant and mania. Relevant articles containing adequate descriptions for presentation were retrieved, and their reference lists were hand-searched for further pertinent material. Hand-searches of the indexes of leading psychiatry journals were also performed for the years 1998-2003. Twenty-three articles were identified for review.\nAntidepressant-withdrawal hypomania or mania may occur rarely with almost any antidepressant drug after sudden withdrawal, tapered discontinuation, or even merely a decrease in dose. The syndrome may be self-limiting, may abate with the reinstitution of the antidepressant drug, or may require specific anti-manic treatments; mood stabilizers do not necessarily protect against the syndrome. The true incidence of the syndrome is unknown. Narrow and broad diagnostic criteria are proposed for the syndrome, and a synthesis of literature is provided."}, {"Title": "[GC-MS analysis of methamphetamine and amphetamine in hair of Thai drug addicts].", "Abstract": "Psycho-stimulant dependence in young individuals has become a serious problem in Thailand, where consumption of the so-called YaBa methamphetamine tablets has become a fashionable trend. Due to its easy availability in the form of a tablet, young individuals abuse methamphetamine. Methamphetamine tablets are known to be potently addictive and its difficulty in cessation of drug use and to be abstinent from the drug. We herein report the results obtained from GC-MS analysis of methamphetamine and amphetamine in 33 samples of urine and hair from patients with psycho-stimulant dependence. These samples were collected from patients registered at the outpatient clinic in the Department of Psychiatry, Chiang Mai University Hospital and were sent to Nippon Medical School, Department of Legal Medicine (Tokyo, Japan) for further analysis by Dr. Werawan Ruangyttikarn, Department of Forensic Medicine, Chiang Mai University. Sample preparation: Hairs samples were cropped near the hair root. After washing, they were cut into 1.2-cm sections and extracted with methanol/5N HCl (2:1) for an hour and then, solid-phase extraction was conducted using Bond-Elut Certify. Following extraction, GC-MS analysis was performed. Urine samples were subjected to GC-MS analysis after preparation with Bond Elut Certify.\nIn 6 samples, both urine and hair samples analyzed were negative for detection of the stimulant drugs. In those cases individuals might stop taking drug for about 5 months. In 18 samples, urine samples were negative whereas hair samples were positive. These results suggest that individuals might stop using drugs for a few days before they went to the hospital but they abuse drugs continuously. In 9 samples, both urine and hair samples were positive. These results show that individuals always abuse drugs. In order to treat drug dependence effectively it is necessary to obtain the patient history of drug use and to evaluate and determine short-term and long-term drug use with urinalysis and hair analysis, respectively. Our present data revealed that useful information concerned with the long term drug abuse can be obtained from hair analysis, and that this method of analysis is applicable not only to forensic cases but also for evaluating clinical cases."}, {"Title": "[The neurology department of the Lankwitz Hospital. A contribution to the history of emigration, psychotherapy and the Berlin hospital].", "Abstract": "At Lankwitz near Berlin the Jewish physicians James Fraenkel and Albert Oliven founded a private hospital in 1890. This hospital, which integrated seven departments, became one of the biggest private asylums in the Reich during the first decade of the 20th century. Parts of the hospital served the military during WWI. As most of the physicians at Lankwitz were Jewish, the year 1933 meant an immense moral and scientific decline, since these physicians were forced to leave and later threatened. We know of one physician killed in a concentration camp. Hardly any research about this hospital had been published until the 1990's. This contribution is the first portraying one department--that of neurology. From the early years of the hospital, therapists involved with psycho-dynamic psychiatry and psychoanalysis were attracted to it. Lankwitz was a major experience for a number of later famous psychiatrists and psychoanalysts. This continued to be the case during the years of the Weimar Republic, after the hospital had been leased [verpachtet] to the insurance companies [gesetzliche Krankenkassen] of Greater Berlin. Revealing more about the history of Berlin's private clinics, this article also contributes to the city's history of neurology, psychiatry and psychotherapy. For the example of Lankwitz, the myth of a 'marginalized psychoanalysis', rejected by the contemorary medicine, cannot be corroborated. On the contrary, the Lankwitz physicians portrayed here seemed to have combined and integrated clinical work with psychoanalytic theory and practice. Germany's turn towards National Socialism however meant an immediate end for the Lankwitz clinic and the mode of therapy described."}, {"Title": "Residency training in public psychiatry: a review of literature.", "Abstract": "Training of psychiatry residents in a conmmunity setting has been emerging as a more rational and reasonable choice for psychiatry residency training, considering the shift of reliance in the recent years for psychiatric services from inpatient care in hospitals to outpatient care in the community.\nA literature review regarding residency training in community psychiatry was performed using the Medline databases. Seven residency training programs' curricula were included in this review. The curriculum of each of these seven programs was also obtained from their respective Internet home pages. The authors describe the community psychiatry training curriculum of their affiliated program, the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\nA brief description of community training curricula of these eight programs is provided. These curricula, especially their unique characteristics, are then compared in a table.\nThe psychiatry training programs differ in many noteworthy ways while providing their residents with \"community psychiatry experience.\" The table provides a quick comparison and highlights the differences of these programs. The authors emphasize the need for a \"model curriculum,\" taking into consideration various factors including the local resources available where the residents could rotate for their community psychiatry experience.\nThe authors concluded that psychiatry residency training programs need to publish their curricula, so that other programs can modify their own curricula, if needed, and hence provide an excellent experience in community psychiatry to their residents and future psychiatrists."}, {"Title": "Narcotic antagonists in drug dependence: pilot study showing enhancement of compliance with SYN-10, amino-acid precursors and enkephalinase inhibition therapy.", "Abstract": "We decided to test the hypothesis that possibly by combining a narcotic antagonist and amino-acid therapy consisting of an enkephalinase inhibitor (D-phenylalanine) and neurotransmitter precursors (L-amino- acids) to promote neuronal dopamine release might enhance compliance in methadone patients rapidly detoxified with the narcotic antagonist Trexan (Dupont, Delaware). In this regard, Thanos et al. [J. Neurochem. 78 (2001) 1094] and associates found increases in the dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2) via adenoviral vector delivery of the DRD2 gene into the nucleus accumbens, significantly reduced both ethanol preference (43%) and alcohol intake (64%) of ethanol preferring rats, which recovered as the DRD2, returned to baseline levels. This DRD2 overexpression similarly produced significant reductions in ethanol non-preferring rats, in both alcohol preference (16%) and alcohol intake (75%). This work further suggests that high levels of DRD2 may be protective against alcohol abuse [JAMA 263 (1990) 2055; Arch, Gen. Psychiatr. 48 (1991) 648]. The DRD2 A1 allele has also been shown to associate with heroin addicts in a number of studies. In addition, other dopaminergic receptor gene polymorphisms have also associated with opioid dependence. For example, Kotler et al. [Mol. Phychiatr. 3 (1997) 251] showed that the 7 repeat allele of the DRD4 receptor is significantly overpresented in the opioid-dependent cohort and confers a relative risk of 2.46. This has been confirmed by Li et al. [Mol. Psychiatry 2 (1997) 413] for both the 5 and 7 repeat alleles in Han Chinese case control sample of heroin addicts. Similarly Duaux et al. [Mol. Psychiatry 3 (1998) 333] in French Heroin addicts, found a significant association with homozygotes alleles of the DRD3-Bal 1. A study from NIAAA, provided evidence which strongly suggests that DRD2 is a susceptibility gene for substance abusers across multiple populations (2003). Moreover, there are a number of studies utilizing amino-acid and enkephalinase inhibition therapy showing reduction of alcohol, opiate, cocaine and sugar craving behavior in human trials (see Table 1). Over the last decade, a new rapid method to detoxify either methadone or heroin addicts utilizing Trexan sparked interest in many treatment centers throughout the United States, Canada, as well as many countries on a worldwide basis. In using the combination of Trexan and amino-acids, results were dramatic in terms of significantly enhancing compliance to continue taking Trexan. The average number of days of compliance calculated on 1000 patients, without amino-acid therapy, using this rapid detoxification method is only 37 days. In contrast, the 12 subjects tested, receiving both the Trexan and amino-acid therapy was relapse-free or reported taking the combination for an average of 262 days (p < 0.0001F). Thus coupling amino-acid therapy and enkephalinase inhibition while blocking the delta-receptors with a pure narcotic antagonist may be quite promising as a novel method to induce rapid detox in chronic methadone patients. This may also have important ramifications in the treatment of both opiate and alcohol-dependent individuals, especially as a relapse prevention tool. It may also be interesting too further test this hypothesis with the sublingual combination of the partial opiate mu receptor agonist buprenorphrine."}, {"Title": "Late-onset depression with mild cognitive deficits: electrophysiological evidences for a preclinical dementia syndrome.", "Abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is present in up to 60% of patients with late-onset depression and constitutes a major diagnostic problem in geriatric psychiatry. Searching for sensitive markers for the detection of early brain changes suggestive of dementia, we compared this depressive risk population with mildly to moderately demented patients and cognitively unimpaired depressed patients using EEG power and coherence. We found a considerable similarity between Alzheimer's disease patients and cognitively impaired depressed patients regarding the cognitive profile and EEG pattern. Changes in EEG power and coherence at frontotemporal leads in depressive patients with MCI thereby allowed discrimination from cognitively unimpaired patients with a sensitivity of 88% and a specifity of 81%."}, {"Title": "Academic performance of psychiatrists compared to other specialists before, during, and after medical school.", "Abstract": "This study was designed to compare psychiatrists with other physicians on measures of academic performance before, during, and after medical school.\nMore than three decades of data for graduates of Jefferson Medical College (N=5,701) were analyzed. Those who pursued psychiatry were compared to physicians in seven other specialties on 18 performance measures. Analysis of covariance was used to control for gender effect.\nCompared to other physicians, psychiatrists scored higher on measures of verbal ability and general information before medical school and on evaluations of knowledge and skills in behavioral sciences during medical school, but they scored lower on United States Medical Licensing Examinations step 3.\nThe results generally confirmed the authors' expectations about psychiatrists' academic performance.

Very little attention has been paid to resistance or to the various ways in which 'patients' or 'survivors' (as some now prefer to refer to themselves) have sought to socially deconstruct 'mental illness'. This paper seeks to redress that balance by way of a detailed examination of some of the key practices of resistance which have developed within the context of the UK mental health survivors movement. Using key concepts from Bourdieu's theory of practice, it examines the challenge which survivors have mounted to the symbolic power of psychiatry, and the resistance habitus which their opposition has given rise to."}, {"Title": "A Relationship of Care Time with Functional Status and Patients Characteristics among Patients in Long-term Care Hospitals.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the functional status variables related to the care time of health professionals for patients in long-term care facilities.\nThe functional stati of 1001 patients in 8 longterm care hospitals were examined by the Resident Assessment Instrument for Long-term Care Facility Version 2.0. The care time of health professionals for patients was calculated using data from a self-reported task survey by nurses, auxiliary nurses, private aides, doctors, physiotherapists and social workers.\nThe average care time per diem was 240.6 minutes. The care time by doctors, nurses and private aides were 11.0, 71.0 and 139.5 minutes, respectively. The lower the function of activities of daily living (ADL) and the greater the symptoms of extensive services, special care and clinical complexity, the more care time was served. On the contrary, the greater the symptoms of nursing rehabilitation, depression, cognitive disorder, behavior problem and psychiatry/mood disorder, the less care time was served. Age and gender were not significantly related to the care time.\nDeveloping a case mix classification system for elderly long term care patients may be helpful for both of patients and health care providers. The ADL, extensive services, special care and clinical complexity of variables should be considered in the development of a case mix system for the long term care of patients in Korea."}, {"Title": "A follow-up evaluation of sexual misconduct complaints: the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners, 1998 through 2002.", "Abstract": "The current study presents an analysis of sexual misconduct allegations that were closed from 1998 through 2002 and is compared with allegations from 1991 through 1995 (study 1). One hundred complaints were closed in study 1, which involved 80 licensees; 23.8% of those complaints resulted in reportable board actions.\nRetrospective analyses of 47 allegations that were closed and that involved 46 practitioners were evaluated statistically and compared with the previous study.\nSexual misconduct was the allegation in 3.1% of all closed complaints, compared with 5.9% in study 1. Of the allegations, 36.2% of the sexual misconduct allegations were for sexual impropriety with no reportable disciplinary outcomes, and 63.8% of the complaints were for sexual violation that resulted in 25 reportable disciplinary actions. Family medicine, psychiatry, and obstetrics/gynecology again reported the highest proportion of total complaints, but psychiatry and obstetrics/gynecology improved both in total complaints and disciplinary actions. Multiple complaints improved significantly in study 2.\nPhysician and patient awareness and board actions reduced total complaints of sexual misconduct. Family medicine was an exception, with 12 reportable board actions compared with 4 in study 1. Reportable disciplinary actions involved revocations, suspensions, and surrender of license; the disciplinary actions most often involved probation, education, counseling and/or psychiatric therapy, and practice limitation. Education, the identification of high-risk practitioners, and the appropriate use of deterrence continue to be areas of recommended focus."}, {"Title": "Forensic psychiatry and political controversy.", "Abstract": "This article gives a U.K.-based perspective on the involvement of forensic psychiatry organizations in questions of political controversy. Medical professional bodies are fundamentally concerned to uphold good standards of clinical practice and patient welfare, and to uphold professional medical ethics. In our specialty, when acting as individual expert witnesses, we seek to serve the courts with objectivity and respect for the law. However, as members of our professional bodies we have a legitimate medical concern about how the law affects the mentally disordered as a class. We should articulate a collective view about what treating the mentally disordered justly and appropriately in the legal system means and should challenge the law when it fails to achieve this."}, {"Title": "AAPL and sociopolitical policy.", "Abstract": "It has been part of the role of medical organizations in Western nations to develop position statements on various sociopolitical issues. Both the American Psychiatric Association and the American Medical Association have established position statements related to social policy, including capital punishment. In 2001, AAPL endorsed a moratorium on capital punishment. Recent calls for AAPL to endorse a recommendation to abolish the death penalty have produced further discussion and a diversity of opinion. The absence of a clear process to develop policy within AAPL complicates both the nature and the resolution of the discussions. Three questions are posed that will help AAPL shape this debate: (1) Do we have anything to contribute? (2) Is there a position consistent with our values? (3) Would a position promote or harm the goals and mandate of the organization?"}, {"Title": "Now is the time for AAPL to demonstrate leadership by advocating positions of social importance.", "Abstract": "The American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law (AAPL) and other medical organizations have not taken a position on the abolition of capital punishment because of a long-standing tradition of remaining neutral on \"nonmedical\" societal issues that are highly divisive. It is the authors' contention that taking a stand on vital social issues that are clearly in the public interest is wholly consistent with the stated purposes of AAPL and that the time has come for an open and frank discussion by the membership on the merits of altering its policy, with particular focus on eliminating the death penalty. The present article explains why capital punishment can no longer be considered a nonmedical societal issue and why AAPL must awaken to take on controversial matters such as this one. For AAPL to continue to avoid this debate and silence any attempt to organize opposition to the current status quo will only serve to embolden those who argue in favor of the death penalty. Such continued silence betrays any notion of neutrality and is an abdication of the canons of medical ethics we have all sworn to uphold."}, {"Title": "The use of restraint and seclusion in different racial groups in an inpatient forensic setting.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine if physical restraint and/or seclusion had been used with different frequencies in patients of different racial groups in an inpatient forensic psychiatry facility. The method used was a retrospective correlational study of all inpatients (n = 806) treated from January 1993 through August 2000 at Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center, a maximum-security inpatient forensic facility in Ward's Island, NY, near New York City. Episodes of restraint and/or seclusion were measured in each racial group. The number of violent incidents involving patients of each racial group was also measured. Racial groups at Kirby did not differ significantly from each other in number of violent incidents nor in the number of episodes of restraints. However, Asians and blacks as racial groups were more likely to have been secluded than were other racial groups. This difference did not persist when the number of incidents of seclusion was considered individually rather than for entire racial groups."}, {"Title": "Countering countertransference, II: beyond evaluation to cross-examination.", "Abstract": "Countertransference is a clinical term introduced by Freud in 1909. For years, despite mounting criticism, forensic psychiatrists borrowed this clinical concept to explain their emotional experiences and responses to examinees' emotions and behavior. The authors describe the impact of examinee and nonexaminee factors during evaluations and beyond, including during trial and while providing forensic testimony. The suggestion is made that using the term countertransference in forensic psychiatry can be problematic. The authors delineate the complexities of the term as related to forensic psychiatry and consider modified terms to provide a better explanation of these concepts in forensic contexts."}, {"Title": "Poststroke Neuropsychiatric Illness: An Integrated Approach to Diagnosis and Management.", "Abstract": "Patients who have had stroke are at significant risk for various neuropsychiatric illnesses. The most common and important of these are poststroke depression and poststroke dementia (attributable to vascular dementia, Alzheimer's dementia, or a combination of mechanisms). Poststroke neuropathology may lead some patients to experience concurrent and \"overlapping\" mood and cognitive symptoms. Less frequently, poststroke anxiety disorders, psychosis, isolated pathologic expressions of emotions, and apathy or fatigue may be encountered.

Thus, the pharmacogenetics of antipsychotics have been aimed at providing genetic components of this inter-individual variability in antipsychotic response in order to establish an individually-based pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia and to elucidate the mechanism of antipsychotic response so as to solve the refractoriness of schizophrenia. Pharmacogenetics, which is defined as the science of pharmacological response and its modification by hereditary influence can be divided into two categories: the genetic background of pharmacokinetics, i.e. the absorption, distribution, tissue localization, biotransformation and excretion of drugs, and pharmacodynamics, i.e. the biochemical and physiological consequences of a drug and its mechanism of action. Pharmacokinetics of antipsychotics has been focused mainly on the association between genetic polymorphisms in CYP genes, including CYP2D6, and the metabolism of these drugs. Polymorphism in CYP2D6 enables a division of individuals within a given population into at least two groups, i.e. poor metabolizers (PMs), extensive metabolizers (EMs), and ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs) of certain drugs. PMs have higher plasma concentrations of and more adverse effects from antipsychotics. UMs could be one of the important factors that induce treatment-refractoriness to antipsychotics. Genetic polymorphisms in serotonin and dopamine receptors that have a high affinity for antipsychotics have so far been extensively investigated in the pharmacodynamics of this type of drug. Not just one gene but multiple genes play a role in complex phenotypes, including the clinical response to medication. Thus, a multiple candidate genes approach has recently been adopted in the pharmacogenetics of antipsychotics. The new field of pharmacogenomics using DNA microarray analysis, which focuses on the genetic determinants of drug response at the level of the entire human genome, is important for development and prescription of safer and more effective individually-tailored antipsychotics."}, {"Title": "Malaysia mental health country profile.", "Abstract": "Malaysia is a tropical country in the heart of south east Asia with a population of 24 million people of diverse ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds living in harmony in 330,000 km(2) of land on the Asian mainland and Borneo. Malaysia, which lies on the crossroads of trade between east and west Asia, has an ancient history as a centre of trading attracting commerce between Europe, west Asia, India and China. It has had influences from major powers that dominated the region throughout its history. Today the country, after independence in 1957, has embarked on an ambitious development project to make it a developed country by 2020. In this effort the economy has changed from one producing raw material to one manufacturing consumer goods and services and the colonial health system has been overhauled and social systems strengthened to provide better services for its people. The per capita income, which was under 1,000 US dollars at independence, has now passed 4,000 US dollars and continues to grow, with the economy largely based on strong exports that amount to over 100 billion US dollars. The mental health system that was based on institutional care in four mental hospitals at independence from British colonial rule in 1957 with no Malaysian psychiatrists is today largely based on over 30 general hospital psychiatric units spread throughout the country. With three local postgraduate training programmes in psychiatry and 12 undergraduate departments of psychiatry in the country--all started after independence--there is now a healthy development of mental health services. This is being supplemented by a newly established primary care mental health service that covers community mental health by integrating mental health into primary health care. Mental health care at the level of psychiatrists rests with about 140 psychiatrists most of whom had undertaken a four-year masters course in postgraduate psychiatry in Malaysia since 1973. However, there continues to be severe shortages of other professionals such as clinical psychologists and social workers in mental health services. There are a few specialists, and specialized services in child, adolescent, forensic, rehabilitative, liaison or research fields of mental health. In the area of services for women and children, as well as the disabled in the community, there are strong efforts to improve the care and provide services that are in keeping with a caring society. New legislation on these are being passed every year and the setting up of a Ministry for Women's Affairs is one such move in recent years. Mental health in Malaysia has been slow in developing but has in the past decade seen important strides to bring it on par with other branches of medicine."}, {"Title": "Chile mental health country profile.", "Abstract": "This paper describes main facts about Chile starting with key socio-demographic, socio-economic, political, environmental, epidemiological, social support and social pathology aspects that characterize the context in which current mental and neurological policy and programmes have been put in place since 2000, as part of the National Health Plan and Health Sector Strategy Plan. The 'National Plan for Mental Health and Psychiatry', using a community psychiatry approach, has been partially implemented for people covered by the Public Health Insurance, which comprises 62% of the Chilean population (people with lower income). This paper also describes: the management, population needs and demands, financial resources, human resources in primary care, mental health specialist care and community-based care, physical capital, social capital, provision and processes, and outcomes of the plan. Strengths are analyzed, like the health reform, including its values and principles, the active participation of consumer and family groups as well as mental health NGOs, access to mental health services through primary care, quality assurance of the mental health services delivered to the population and progressive development of a culture of respect for human rights, including those of people with mental illnesses. Finally, difficulties for the advance of mental health care are also enumerated: the low priority still given to mental health compared with physical health by the country's leaders, the insufficient emphasis on mental health in both undergraduate and postgraduate professional training, the strong stigma and discrimination associated with mental illness in the general population and the advocacy by some mental health professionals of the traditional model of care (role of the psychiatric hospital)."}, {"Title": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a 19th century children's book.", "Abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a major mental disorder in children. Presently, its pathogenesis and treatment as well as its role in adult psychiatry are subjects of heated debate. As early as 1846, the typical symptoms of ADHD were described by Heinrich Hoffmann, a physician who later founded the first mental hospital in Frankfurt. Interestingly, his description was published in a children's book entitled \"Struwwelpeter\" which he had designed for his 3-year-old son Carl Philipp. The symptomatology is impressively depicted in the colourfully illustrated story of \"Zappel-Philipp\" (\"Fidgety Philip\"), probably the first written mention of ADHD by a medical professional.

A meta-analysis we did in this work, which is based on previous nine studies plus our own unpublished data including a total of 2399 schizophrenic patients (sporadic cases 2099, familial cases >505) and more than 3261 controls, failed to show significant difference of -308G/A distribution between patients and controls in both the whole sample and the pooled Asian sample.

In this context, the dysbindin gene (dystrobrevin-binding-protein 1, DTNBP1), which was recently reported to be associated with schizophrenia seems to be an interesting candidate gene for affective disorders. Dysbindin is widely expressed in the human brain and binds to the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC) which appears to be involved in signal transduction pathways, which have been repeatedly investigated and described as altered or disturbed in affective disorders [McLeod et al. [2003: Psychopharmacol Bull 35:24-41]; Brambilla et al. [2003: Mol Psychiatry 8:721-737]]. Therefore, we investigated whether five SNPs in the dysbindin gene could be susceptibility factors in the ethiology of major depression or for the response to antidepressant treatment in a sample of 293 patients compared to 220 healthy controls. Applying single SNP evaluation, as well as haplotype analysis we could not detect an association between the dysbindin polymorphisms and major depression or the response to antidepressant treatment. In conclusion, our results suggest that SNPs in the dysbindin gene are unlikely to play a major role in the pathophysiology of major depression or are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a neighboring mutation or gene. Further analysis are needed to confirm these results."}, {"Title": "Premorbid cognitive and behavioral functioning in military recruits experiencing the first episode of psychosis.", "Abstract": "To characterize the premorbid cognitive and behavioral abilities in apparently healthy adolescents who at a later time will be diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder or schizophrenia.\nClarifying the pathological relationship between subtle intellectual and behavioral abnormalities and disease could provide markers for the early prediction of future psychosis.\nPremorbid data on young male patients admitted to the Department of Psychiatry of the Central Military Hospital in Bucharest, Romania, between 1996 and 2002 and diagnosed with a first episode of psychosis or schizophreniform disorder were collected. The premorbid data consisted in the test scores of intellectual functioning and personality traits were collected by the Romanian Draft Board in order to assesses their aptitude to serve in the military. Premorbid cognitive and behavioral scores of male patients (cases=157) were compared with the scores of healthy male individuals (non-cases=169) matched for age, education, and geographic area of residence.

It was based on a search of the electronic databases MEDLINE and PsycINFO covering the period 1966 to June 2003. Studies were selected for review if they concerned videoconferencing for patient care or consultation, evaluated a clinical service or education, or assessed satisfaction with videoconferences. Twenty-seven articles were identified that fulfilled the selection criteria. These comprised two reports of randomized controlled experiments, 10 of descriptive questionnaire studies or observational surveys, seven case studies and eight other reports. Only three of the studies presented some calculations of cost-effectiveness. When classified by 'Quality of Evidence' criteria, only two studies were in category I (the highest), one was in II-2 and the rest fell into category III (the lowest). Most studies of child and adolescent telepsychiatry examined satisfaction with videoconferencing or described programmes or care regimens. Videoconferencing seemed to improve the accessibility of services and served an educational function. Some papers also mentioned savings in time, costs and travel. Problems with non-verbal communication and the audiovisual quality of the videoconference were mentioned as drawbacks. Telepsychiatry therefore seems to offer several benefits, at least in sparsely populated regions.

It was hypothesised that the PBL curriculum would result in increased deep learning, decreased surface learning, more favourable attitudes to psychiatry and improved examination performance. It was predicted that students' examination success would be related to the use of deep and strategic learning and favourable attitudes.\nConsecutive cohorts of Year 2 clinical students taught using a traditional psychiatry curriculum (n = 188) and a PBL curriculum (n = 191) were compared. Students completed the Study Process Questionnaire to assess their learning styles and the Attitudes to Psychiatry Scale at the beginning and end of the attachment. Students completed 2 end-of-attachment examinations, a multiple-choice paper and a viva.\nThe PBL curriculum resulted in significantly better examination performance than did the traditional teaching curriculum, both for multiple-choice questions and the viva. No differences in learning styles or attitudes to psychiatry were found between the curricula. Students were significantly more successful in the examinations if they had received the PBL curriculum, were female, and used strategic learning.\nExamination performance indicated that the PBL curriculum was more successful than the previous course, but that this improvement was not due to students using more effective learning styles or having more favourable attitudes towards psychiatry. It is possible that students learned more effectively during the teaching sessions in the PBL curriculum, but did not change their preferred learning styles."}, {"Title": "The beer ration in Victorian asylums.", "Abstract": "Routine distribution of alcoholic beverages to mental hospital patients would be a fanciful prospect today, yet in the formative decades of lunatic asylums, beer was standard issue. A staple item in the supposedly healthy Victorian asylum diet, beer also served as inducement for patient labour. Around the mid-1880s, this commodity was abolished throughout Britain's mental institutions.

Zuclopenthixol acetate is said to have these properties.\nTo estimate the clinical effects of zuclopenthixol acetate for the management of acute aggression or violence thought to be due to serious mental illnesses, in comparison to other drugs used to treat similar conditions.\nWe supplemented past searches of Current Controlled Trials (10/2000), the Cochrane Library (1997) and MEDLINE (1966-1997) and appeals for unpublished data with an update search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of trials (September 2003).\nAll randomised clinical trials involving people thought to have serious mental illnesses comparing zuclopenthixol acetate with other drugs.\nData were extracted independently by two reviewers and cross-checked. We calculated fixed effects relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data. Where possible, the number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H) was calculated. We analyzed by intention-to-treat. Mean differences were used for continuous variables.\nWe found no data for the primary outcome, tranquilisation. Compared with haloperidol, zuclopenthixol acetate was no more sedating at two hours (n=40, 1 RCT, RR 0.60 CI 0.27 to 1.34). People given zuclopenthixol acetate were not at reduced risk of being given supplementary antipsychotics (n=134, 3 RCTs, RR 1.49 CI 0.97 to 2.30) although additional use of benzodiazepines was less (n=50, 1 RCT, RR 0.03 CI 0.00 to 0.47, NNT 2 CI 2 to 4). People given zuclopenthixol acetate had fewer injections over seven days compared with those allocated to haloperidol IM (n=70, 1 RCT, RR 0.39 CI 0.18 to 0.84, NNT 4 CI 3 to 14). We found no data on more episodes of aggression or harm to self or others. One trial (n=148) reported no significant difference in adverse effects for people receiving zuclopenthixol acetate compared with those allocated haloperidol at one, three and six days (RR 0.74 CI 0.43 to 1.27). Compared with haloperidol or clotiapine, people allocated zuclopenthixol did not seem to be at more risk of a range of movement disorders (<20%). Three studies found no difference in the proportion of people getting blurred vision/ dry mouth (n=192, 2 RCTs, RR at 24 hours 0.90 CI 0.48 to 1.70). Similarly dizziness was equally infrequent for those allocated zuclopenthixol acetate compared with haloperidol (n=192, 2 RCTs, RR at 24 hours 1.15 CI 0.46 to 2.88). There was no difference between treatments for leaving the study before completion (n=522, RR 0.85 CI 0.31 to 2.31).\nRecommendations on the use of zuclopenthixol acetate for the management of psychiatric emergencies in preference to 'standard' treatment have to be viewed with caution. Most trials present important methodological flaws and findings are poorly reported. This review did not find any suggestion that zuclopenthixol acetate is more or less effective in controlling aggressive acute psychosis, or in preventing adverse effects than intramuscular haloperidol, and neither seemed to have a rapid onset of action.

The study examined 4 years of denials of certification for reimbursement by payers of inpatient care (1998-2001). Psychiatry was first compared to clinical services with a like number of annual admissions and then compared to clinical services with a like number of concurrent reviews. For each year, psychiatry had the highest numbers of cases denied and patient days denied. The most frequent reason for a psychiatric denial was that the inpatient benefit level had been exceeded. There was only one instance, in 4 years, when this reason (benefit limit exceeded) was given for a patient with a physical illness.

The vignette describing a person with schizophrenia, attitudes to general aspects of mental health (lay helping, community psychiatry), emotions toward those affected, and the attitude toward consequences of mental illness (medical treatment, medication side effects, negative sanctions, e.g. withdrawal of the driver license) were found to predict social distance. Demographic factors such as age, gender, and the cultural background influence social distance. The explained variance (R2) is 44.8%.\nSocial distance is a multifaceted concept influenced by, e.g., socio-economic and cultural factors, but also by the respondent's general attitude toward (mental) health issues.

About 6% of the Pakistani population suffers from this illness and approximately 50% ofthose affected seek treatment. The health budget of the country is very low, average per capita income is 430 US dollars and 35% of the population falls below the poverty line. It follows that depression puts a heavy economic burden on its sufferers.\nThe aim of this study was to estimate the economic burden on patients suffering from depression who were attending community psychiatry clinics.\nThis is a prevalence-based analysis of mental health care expenditure in a sample of 200 patients with an ICD-X diagnosis of depression. The patients attended four private community clinics, run on a once-a-week basis, with all care paid for by the patients out of pocket. A questionnaire was designed with a view to gathering information on out-of-pocket treatment and travel expenditures. The data was subjected to SPSS analysis.\nAmong the subjects enrolled in the study (n=200), 85% were spending over Rs. 3,133 (51.40 US dollars) per month as general expenses on health. Sixty-five percent of the subjects were earning below Rs. 5,000 ( 86.00 US dollars). The majority used the public bus for transportation, costing the family Rs. 83 (1.40 US dollars) per trip. Laboratory investigation costs were negligible as there is a lesser emphasis on lab tests in psychiatry.\nThe high cost of depression keeps a vast majority of the population away from ongoing treatment, which contributes to the misery of the illness and the associated loss of productivity. The national budget is very low, the average income for the majority is far from satisfactory, and though partial support from charitable organizations, public sector hospitals, insurance cover and medical facilities is available, the majority of needs are unmet. It is essential to increase the health budget and enhance efforts toward preventive strategies.

The new EGA rating scale offers the possibility to assess patient resources as abilities and health-maintaining features in four areas of life. To test the validity of the EGA, 39 schizophrenic patients participated in the current study. Those with more health-maintaining features in the EGA showed significantly fewer psychic and somatic symptoms (SCL-90 R), better social and occupational functioning (SOFAS), higher sense of coherence (SOC), and better social adjustment(FSI). They were significantly younger at the beginning of their disease and had more frequently held jobs during the previous 12 months.

Within the last few years, it has become increasingly evident that the neuroendocrine and behavioral phenotypes of mood and anxiety disorders are at least in part mediated by modulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurocircuitries and that normalization of an altered neurotransmission after treatment may lead to restoration of disease-related changes. Although this concept was originally derived from peripheral hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) assessments in depressed patients, central CRH neuropeptidergic circuits other than those driving the peripherally accessible HPA system may be overactive and could be therapeutic targets of antagonist actions. Genetically engineered mice provide a novel and useful tool to study the endogenous mechanisms underlying aberrant behavior and CRH neurocircuitry regulation. The results obtained from conventional and conditional mutant mice indicate that CRH type 1 receptors may be the primary target to which to direct selective nonpeptide compounds. Moreover, beyond the encouraging preclinical studies, the first clinical open trial supports the notion that CRH type 1 receptors can be safely and effectively antagonized."}, {"Title": "Allergic rhinitis in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "Both allergic rhinitis and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are common pediatric conditions associated with learning difficulties and sleep disturbances.

This overlaps in many areas with the field of geriatric psychiatry, which is expected to play a significant role in diagnosis and hospitalization in the long-term care insurance system. Representative of the former is the forgetfulness clinic, and representative of the latter is the \"senile dementia disorder center\". When a person at home or in a nursing facility becomes seriously demented or suffers serious physical illness, he is generally hospitalized. However, there is an ongoing project which allows group homes to care for the seriously demented or physically damaged elderly. Under the long-term care insurance system, there are many problems that should be dealt with by geriatric psychiatry. One essential issue is the lack of basic research on judgment abilities and mental competency, even though users are expected to select services and make their own decisions under this system. Once there is a social support system for the care-requiring elderly, it is necessary to assess the decision-making ability of individual elderly. If this ability is sufficiently maintained it should be respected to the utmost. If it is impaired, we must have a viewpoint on how to provide care through a social system. A consensus has yet to be reached on informed consent for the demented elderly, and this issue should be considered with a focus on geriatric psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The establishment of the department of psychiatry in the Mount Sinai Hospital: a conflict between neurology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "A conflict between neurology and psychiatry and controversies about psychoanalysis played an important role in the establishment of psychiatry in the general hospital.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and conditioners of polypharmacy in psychiatric patients.\nA cross-sectional survey was carried out using the Canary Islands Health Service Clinical Records Database. A representative sample (n = 2,647) of patients with mental disorders receiving psychotropic medication was studied.\nThe mean number of psychoactive drugs prescribed was 1.63 +/- 0.93 (range 1-7). The rate of polypharmacy was 41.9%, with 27.8% of patients receiving two drugs, 9.1% receiving three, 3.2% receiving four, and 1.8% of the patients receiving five or more psychotropic drugs. Multiple regression analysis shows that variables sex and diagnosis have a predictive value with regard to the number of psychotropic drug used, being men and schizophrenic patients the most predisposed. Benzodiazepines were the more prevalent drugs in monotherapy, while anticonvulsants and antipsychotics were the more used in combination with other treatment. A questionable very high degree of same-class polypharmacy was evidenced, while multi-class, adjunctive and augmentation polypharmacy seem to be more appropriate.\nAlmost half of the psychiatric patients are treated with several psychotropics. Polypharmacy is common and seems to be problematic, especially when same class of drugs are prescribed together. Some diagnoses, such as schizophrenia, are associated with an increase risk of Polypharmacy but there is a lack of evidence based indicators that allows for quality evaluation on this practice."}, {"Title": "[About the use of seclusion in psychiatry: the patients' point of view].", "Abstract": "In this study of psychiatric inpatients' perceptions of the seclusion-room experience, 67 admitted inpatients were interviewed during 6 Months within 3 days of the experience, and 24 hours after. A 35-items semistructured interview schedule was used to obtain information on six research questions. Subjects' perception of the reasons for their seclusions varied greatly from perceptions of staff members. Findings implied that for some patients seclusion may have been unnecessary, but for others it was beneficial. Subjects who reported out-of-control impulses or pathological intensity of relationships prior to seclusion and who showed positive change in mood, behavior, or thinking toward staff and/or other patients during or after seclusion seem to have benefited from the experience. Seclusion is a common practice in most psychiatric inpatient settings. The reported incidence of seclusion varies from 4% to 66% of admissions to psychia-tric facilities. But seclusion is controversial. Opponents of seclusion have based their arguments on a concern for the rights of mental patients and a dedication to treat patients in the least restrictive environment. Proponents of seclusion have based their arguments on the theoretical benefits of isolation and the reduction of external stimuli. However, little information about the psychiatric patients experience before, during and after seclusion is currently available. The purpose of this exploratory descriptive study is to gather information on psychiatric patients' perceptions of their seclusion-room experiences, their experiences immediately before and after seclusion, and how they thought these experiences affected them or others. Subjects and staff described the reasons for seclusion differently. For example, subjects described situations leading up to seclusion, but staff described aggressive behavior justifying seclusion. Yet, almost all reasons provided by both groups involved subjects' out-of-control impulses or problems in relationships. The physical, behavioral, and emotional responses of patients to seclusion have been the subject of both observation and more formal investigation. In a study of 263 seclusion episodes, Gerlock and Solomons (1983) noted that 83% of the patients evidenced disturbed behavior at the initiation of seclusion and only 23% did so on release. In a study of the use of the quiet room on a children's unit, Joshi et al. (1988) observed that 92% of the patients who were agitated when placed in the quiet room were calm on release and that 79% were able to rejoin group activities. As for nonempirical investigations, Gair et al. (1965) observed no ill effects (such as fear, withdrawal, or disorganization) and an improvement in inner controls as a result of the use of seclusion on a children's unit. Way and Banks (1990) cautioned against the side effects of humiliation, disorientation, and medical complications of restraint and seclusion in the elderly. As previously noted, many re-presentatives of the psychiatric consumer/survivor movement have characterized seclusion as an extraordinarily traumatic intervention. It is therefore important to examine empirical studies of the emotional effects of this intervention on patients. Perhaps the best-known study is that of Wadeson and Carpenter (1976), which involved 62 mostly unmedicated patients on an NIMH research unit with a seclusion rate of 66%. Patients were asked to draw their experiences and feelings connected with their illness and treatment in three art sessions (2 weeks after admission, 2 weeks before discharge, and 1 Year later). Thirty-three percent of the patients drew the seclusion experience. Their art work and their discussions of it revealed negative feelings (fear, estrangement, hostility, retaliation, guilt, paranoia, bitterness) as well as sadomasochistic conflicts and comforting hallucinations (possibly as a response to sensory deprivation). Several other studies have investigated patients' emotional responses to seclusion. Binder and Mac Coy (1983) conducted semistructured interviews with 24 patients who had been secluded. Thirteen of the 24 patients had no idea or a false idea as to why they had been secluded, 22 were unaware that staff checked on them every 15 minutes, and 13 felt that there was nothing good about the experience. Ne-vertheless, half of the 24 patients felt that the intervention had been necessary and about half felt that it would not adversely affect their attitudes toward treatment. Plutchik et al. (1978) investigated the perceptions of seclusion of patients who had or had not been secluded. Patients who had not been secluded felt safer when they saw others being secluded. Patients who had been secluded felt angry when others were secluded and bored and angry while in seclusion, but the majority felt that seclusion helped calm them down. Patients accurately perceived the precipitants of seclusion. Plutchik et al. also looked at staff perceptions. They found that although most staff felt that seclusion was beneficial to patients, professional staff had the most \"regrets\" about it. Patients accurately estimated and staff significantly underestimated the average duration of seclusion. Joshi et al. (1988) noted that 14% of children who had been secluded on their unit were angry and 17% were sad while they were in seclusion. Sheridan et al. (1990) observed a 2:1 ratio of negative-to-positive attitudes toward seclusion among patients interviewed at a VA hospital. They also noted that patients' attitudes toward initial seclusion had no effect on subsequent seclusion rates. Thus, although it appears to be reasonably well-established that seclusion \"works\", i.e., it provides an effective means for preventing injury and reducing agitation, it is at least equally well-established that this procedure can have serious deleterious physical and (more often) psychological effects on patients."}, {"Title": "Billing for psychiatric evaluations: options for coding and reimbursement.", "Abstract": "The complexity of the current practice environment challenges clinicians to master complicated billing and coding regulations.

A two-phase case-identification using the Chinese Health Questionnaire and the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) was carried out among a sample of consecutive new attenders (n=990) in community and hospital-based clinics. Physicians completed a checklist of the problems that they identified during each consultation. General medical doctors missed more than 85% of the CIS-R cases of defined mental disorder. Physicians performed better identification of CMD among attenders with a higher socioeconomic status, without physical illness, having psychological presentation or attribution, suffering from more serious common mental disorders, or having a longer duration of illness. The very low identification rate of CMD has strongly implied the need to improve postgraduate training in psychiatry for general medical doctors in Taiwan. Simply adding one or two questions about mood and attributions of presenting symptoms might help physicians to identify CMD."}, {"Title": "Integrating psychiatry and primary care improves acceptability to mental health services among Chinese Americans.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate whether integrating psychiatry and primary healthcare improves referral to and treatment acceptability of mental health services among Chinese Americans. The \"Bridge Project,\" a program to enhance collaboration between primary care and mental health services for low-income Chinese immigrants was implemented at South Cove Community Health Center in Boston. The project consisted of conducting training seminars to primary care physicians to enhance recognition of common mental disorders, using a primary care nurse as the \"bridge\" to facilitate referrals to the Behavioral Health Department of the same facility, and co-locating a psychiatrist in the primary care clinic to provide onsite evaluation and treatment. The rate of mental health service referrals and successful treatment engagement before and during the project were compared. During the 12-month period of the Bridge Project, primary care physicians referred 64 (1.05% of all clinic patients) patients to mental health services, a 60% increase (chi(2)=4.97, P<.05) in the percentage of clinic patients referred in the previous 12 months. Eighty-eight percent of patients referred during the project showed up for psychiatric evaluation, compared to 53% (chi(2)=15.3, P<.001) in the previous 12 months.

For schizophrenic patients, the occurrence of seizures with atypical agents is highest among antipsychotics, although these agents are more effective in alleviating symptoms (including negative symptoms) and are associated with fewer extrapiramidal effects. The indol alkaloid alstonine is the major component of plants used by traditional Nigerian psychiatrists as anti-dementia drugs. The alkaloid presents an experimental profile very similar to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. This study aimed to compare the pro-convulsant activity of these two antipsychotic compounds. Through repetitive administration over a 30-day period in a kindling paradigm, it is shown that, unlike clozapine, alstonine does not possess pro-convulsant activity. The data adds to previous suggestions that alstonine deserves to be scrutinized as a model for the development of newer antipsychotics."}, {"Title": "Lifetime influence of one year with Gerry Smith.", "Abstract": "I spent just one year working with Gerry Smith; it was during the research elective portion of my last year of psychiatry residency.

Whereas the work I do today may bear little direct resemblance to what I did in the Bourne Laboratory more than 25 years ago, Gerry had a major influence on the what and the how of my professional career. Gerry was more than a mentor; he was a friend, philosopher, and guide. He promoted a value system that included a passion for learning and collegiality. He always stressed that empirical data trumped expert opinions, and that it was necessary to challenge long-held scientific dogmas from time to time. Through personal example, he showed the importance of giving back to one's trainees what one had received from the mentors. He also showed how even animal research could be an enjoyable social activity. Last but not least, Gerry's way of treating the laboratory staff, including faculty and trainees, as a family, was one of a kind.

Integrated teaching packages are needed to help general practice trainees manage various presentations of psychological distress. Such packages comprise training videotapes, in which models such as problem-solving treatment (PST) are demonstrated, as well as roleplaying material for new skills, self-report questionnaires for patients, and small-group video feedback of consultations. While GP trainees can effectively master such skills, it is important to query the level of proficiency required by registrars. Are these skills of use only to connoisseur GPs, or to all?

However, the etiology of FAD in patients with schizophrenia has remained unclear, primarily because the possible psychogenic or reactive mechanisms of delusional contagion supposed in FAD were not compatible with the classical concept of endogenous psychosis. However, possible psychogenic mechanisms of FAD in schizophrenia were argued by Bleuler, E and Bleuler, M. The problem of how to distinguish the endogenesis from the psychogenesis (reaction) in FAD results in an aporia well-discussed in the German-speaking psychiatry: how induction in endogeneous psychosis might be possible? In the present study, first, a case of FAD in a husband and wife both with schizophrenia was reported. Three case reports of FAD in schizophrenic married couples from Japanese literature were also examined and the concept of the mind which lies in the background of psychogenesis/endogenesis dicotomy was discussed.\nA 34-year-old housewife had constructed a persecutory delusion shortly after the death of her father. She became convinced that her relative who was a Yakuza (Japanese Mafia) member was planning to kill her. She also reported auditory hallucinations. Her 41-year-old husband, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia six years before the incident, first denied the claim of his wife that she had become a target of the Yakuza. However, shortly after that, he came to be convinced that he had become a target of another Yakuza. The couple took refuge in the husband's parents' home. Nevertheless, each of them thought that only he or she would be assassinated and not his or her spouse. After hospitalization, the husband was separated from his wife and soon recovered from his delusional state. However, the wife partially kept her persecutory delusion and full insight into her mental disorder could not be obtained after treatment. According to Gralnick's definition and sub-classifications of FAD, this case was diagnosed as FAD, subtype of \"folie induite\".\nObserved delusions of folie \u00e0 deux in schizophrenic couples were classified into the following two categories, based on the subjective pronoun of the delusional statement: 1) We-type: \"We are persecuted\", generally observed in cases of paranoid type schizophrenia, paranoid disorder, and shared paranoid disorder; 2) I-type: \"I am persecuted\", observed in cases of non-paranoid schizophrenia in particular. It could be argued that the We-type suggests the establishment of a delusional community within participants not seen in the I-type delusion. However, according to clinical observations, even in We-type delusion, subjects ignored the wills and thoughts of their partners and somehow constructed the delusional community in a somewhat one-sided and egocentric way. In both We-type and I-type delusional formation, true communication was not established because of the limitation to the solipsistic view point inherent to the subjects involved. Therefore, we designated the We-type delusional view point as Paranoid Solipsism in FAD and the I-type as Schizophrenic Solipsism in FAD. According to German traditional psychiatry, We-type Paranoid Solipsism may correspond to \"psychogenic\" delusional formation mechanism and I-type Schizophrenic Solipsism to \"endogenous\" mechanism. The structural similarity between Paranoid Solipsism and the Husserlian concept of transcendental ego was also discussed. The author suggested that classical \"psychogenesis\" theory in psychiatry was founded on the modern concept of mind, which is inseparable from the European philosophical tradition of self-concept by Descartes and Husserl. From the Japanese literature, the author pointed out that the majority of FAD cases in Japan took the form of possession psychosis until the 1970's, and that We-type and I-type delusional formation in FAD appeared only after the late 70's. The implication of these transformations of FAD phenomenology in accordance with social structure change was briefly discussed regarding the relationship between the modernity and FAD delusion."}, {"Title": "Treatment outcome of schizophrenia co-morbid with obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "To evaluate the pharmacological treatment outcome of schizophrenia, co-morbid with obsessive-compulsive disorder by comparing the effects of typical neuroleptic, atypical neuroleptic and a combination of typical with anti-obsessional drugs on positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and obsessional symptoms.\nA quasi-experimental study.\nThe study was conducted at the Department of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Medical Institute and Services hospital, Lahore from September 2002 to July 2003.\nThe sample consisted of 39 patients suffering from schizophrenia co-morbid with obsessive-compulsive disorder.

At the same time there was also a greater demand for doctors in the employment of business and industry, particularly the insurance industry and the railways. These opportunities for salaried employment somewhat reduced doctors' professional autonomy and occasionally encouraged intra-professional squabbles. Yet they also provided a springboard for general professional regulation, growing professional status in specialisms like psychiatry, and a solid base for the economic survival of country doctors."}, {"Title": "Therapeutic drug monitoring of psychotropic drugs. TDM \"nouveau\".", "Abstract": "TDM applied in psychiatry dates back several decades. The reason for this is that, after the advent of modern clinical psychopharmacology around the middle of the past century, an insight came to common knowledge about the existence of (1) a large interindividual pharmacokinetic (PK) variability for virtually all psychoactive drugs and (2) a worse clinical efficacy not only in inadequate drug concentrations but also in excessively high concentrations. From this concept, the definition of a therapeutic concentration \"window\" was evidenced for a substantial number of, primarily, antidepressant drugs. However, with the further extensive development of the clinically available pharmacopoeia of psychoactive drugs from the later 1980s until today, the concept of less toxic compounds than before has commonly been launched in the marketing strategies for these newer drugs. This concept also led to the idea that TDM was no longer necessary for the newer types of psychoactive drugs, a position backed up by difficulties in unraveling concentration-effect relationships generally for these drugs in clinical trials. The present survey summarizes the background history for TDM in psychiatry and makes a critical appraisal of why a \"lack\" of definition of concentration-effect relationships for newer psychoactive drugs is now common. This survey also provides the reader with a novel concept challenging ambient TDM strategies (referred to as TDM \"traditionelle\") in psychiatry by forwarding a theoretical model called TDM \"nouveau.\" In this model both inter- and intraindividual (over time) PK variation is suggested to be used for dose optimization by TDM in a naturalistic clinical setting. The previous concept of a simple, common concentration \"window\" existing for all such drugs is questioned by promotion of the use of available PK data merely as \"guiding principles\" rather than as \"reference values\" when interpreting the TDM outcome in individual cases."}, {"Title": "The Section and Board of Psychiatry of the Union of European Medical Specialists (UEMS): achievements and perspectives.", "Abstract": "The enlargement of the European Union (EU) creates new inspiration and challenges for the Section and Board of Psychiatry of the Union of European Medical Specialists (UEMS).

Gen. Psychiatry 57 (2000) 331]. However, individuals with ASD do not typically exhibit the striking behavioral deficits that might be expected to result from fusiform gyrus damage, such as those seen in prosopagnosia, and their deficits appear to extend well beyond face identification to include a wide range of impairments in social perceptual processing. In this study, our goal was to further assess the question of whether individuals with ASD have abnormal fusiform gyrus activation to faces. We used high-field (3 T) functional magnetic resonance imaging to study face perception in 11 adult individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 10 normal controls. We used face stimuli, object stimuli, and sensory control stimuli (Fourier scrambled versions of the face and object stimuli) containing a fixation point in the center to ensure that participants were looking at and attending to the images as they were presented. We found that individuals with ASD activated the fusiform face area and other brain areas normally involved in face processing when they viewed faces as compared to non-face stimuli. These data indicate that the face-processing deficits encountered in ASD are not due to a simple dysfunction of the fusiform area, but to more complex anomalies in the distributed network of brain areas involved in social perception and cognition."}, {"Title": "Imaging of brain function using SPECT.", "Abstract": "Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a technique widely used in nuclear medicine for the imaging of the many organs including the skeleton and heart, as well as for whole body imaging for the detection of tumors. The use of tracers of cerebral perfusion and more recently brain neurotransmitter systems has resulted in the development of a number of applications for brain SPECT in neurology and psychiatry. Indications have been established in cases of dementia, epilepsy, neurovascular disorders, Parkinsonism, and following minor head trauma. It also has the potential to be a valuable research tool for the study of in vivo brain function. In this paper an overview will be given of the principles underlying Brain SPECT, the performance of the procedure, and its applications as a diagnostic modality and research tool."}, {"Title": "Evaluating treatments for the mood disorders: time for the evidence to get real.", "Abstract": "To detail limitations to level I evidence derived from randomised controlled trials of antidepressant treatments and which is held to be fundamental to the development and validity of treatment guidelines.\nRecent efficacy studies and meta-analyses of treatments of major depression are considered.\nThe largest database in psychiatry--demonstrating that all principal treatments are of similar efficacy, and that antidepressant drugs are not distinctly superior to placebo treatment--is unlikely to be valid.\nExcessive belief in and weighting of the evidence emerging from randomised controlled trials deserves to be criticized.

Treatment choice depends on the clinician's skills and the patient's circumstances and preferences, and should be guided but not determined by these guidelines. In moderately severe depression, all recognized antidepressants, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are equally effective; clinicians should consider treatment burdens as well as benefits, including side-effects and toxicity. In severe depression, antidepressant treatment should precede psychological therapy. For depression with psychosis, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or a tricyclic combined with an antipsychotic are equally helpful. Treatments for other subtypes are discussed. Caution is necessary in people on other medication or with medical conditions. If response to an adequate trial of a first-line treatment is poor, another evidence-based treatment should be used.

Data on patient characteristics, fall circumstances, and injury were collected through interviews with patients and/or nurses and review of adverse event reports and medical records. Fall rates and nurse staffing levels were compared by service.\nA 1,300-bed urban academic hospital over 13 weeks.\nAll inpatient falls reported for medicine, cardiology, neurology, orthopedics, surgery, oncology, and women and infants services during the study period were included. Falls in the psychiatry service and falls during physical therapy sessions were excluded.\nA total of 183 patients fell during the study period. The average age of patients who fell was 63.4 years (range 17 to 96). Many falls were unassisted (79%) and occurred in the patient's room (85%), during the evening/overnight (59%), and during ambulation (19%). Half of the falls (50%) were elimination related, which was more common in patients over 65 years old (83% vs 48%; P <.001). Elimination-related falls increased the risk of fall-related injury (adjusted odds ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 5.3). The medicine and neurology services had the highest fall rates (both were 6.12 falls per 1,000 patient-days), and the highest patient to nurse ratios (6.5 and 5.3, respectively).\nFalls in the hospital affect young as well as older patients, are often unassisted, and involve elimination-related activities.

However, a review of available evidence indicates a remarkable consistency between these views and current data from experimental psychopathology and cognitive neuroscience. This consistency is especially pronounced in the area of schizophrenia. In addition, there is a convergence of cognitive and neurobiological evidence regarding the validity of early Gestalt views of both normal brain-behavior relationships and disordered ones, as in schizophrenia. This article reviews some contributions of Gestalt psychology regarding schizophrenia and examines these views in light of more recent findings from cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and experimental psychopathology. We conclude that Gestalt theory is a viable theoretical framework from which to understand schizophrenia. Specifically, it appears that a breakdown of Gestalt organizational processes may characterize both the cognitive and the brain processes in schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "[Psychosocial rehabilitation at the dawn of the 21st century: III: Interdisciplinary evaluation method and bio-psycho-social schedule].", "Abstract": "During the past 20 years, therapeutic and rehabilitative modalities in the field of psychosocial rehabilitation have been diversified in becoming more specific.

The content of these programs associates various forms of specialized medical and paramedical services. The indications are established trough a careful assessment. The rehabilitation unit of the University Department of Psychiatry in Lausanne has developed a multidisciplinary assessment method based on the bio-psychosocial integrative model and the vulnerability-stress model in integrating the level of experience of Wood for the analysis of the psychosocial functioning.

This failure can be attributed to an ambiguous phenotypic description and several variations in the genetic transmission of these diseases. There is a growing consensus that an endophenotype approach may be utilized to overcome the difficulties regarding the phenotypic description and facilitate the identification of the susceptibility or protective genes. The endophenotypes which can be defined as subclinical vulnerability markers may assist in the identification of the genetic underpinnings of psychiatric disorders regardless of the disease status. This approach may provide well-defined phenotypes having a stronger relationship with the pathophysiology and genetic etiology than with the diagnostic categories themselves. An endophenotype may be an inherited neurophysiological, neuropsychological, cognitive, neuroanatomical, biochemical or endocrinological trait. Nevertheless, it must be 1) associated with illness, 2) present in nonaffected family members at a higher rate than in the general population, 3) present within the normal population to a lesser extent and 4) state-independent. Besides increasing the power of genetic analysis in BPD and schizophrenia, an endophenotype approach may help in reshaping the classical nosological systems and diagnostic categories. Lastly, it may have additional use in psychiatry, including the development of suitable animal models for these disorders. In this article, the rationale for the use of endophenotypes in genetic studies of BPD and schizophrenia is discussed and the proposed candidate endophenotypes for both disorders are reviewed."}, {"Title": "Migraine and tension headache in children under 6 years of age.", "Abstract": "To investigate the clinical features of idiopathic headache with early onset, whose presence is probably underestimated by parents and physicians and the influence of environmental and psychological factors on headache in children.\nWe report on a prospective longitudinal evaluation of 35 consecutive children referred to the Neuropsychiatry Departments of the Universities of Varese and Pavia (mean age at the first observation: 4 years and 7 months, range: 12 months-6 years; mean age at onset: 4 years and 2 months, range: 10 months-6 years) presenting with headache symptomatology. Mean duration of clinical follow-up: 9.5 months. The diagnosis based on the IHS criteria was then compared to the intuitive clinical diagnosis made in accordance with alternative case definitions. We examined our patients for the presence of early developmental disorders and interictal somatic disorders. We also studied the role of psychosocial factors at the onset and in the course of headache.\nmigraine without aura in two cases, episodic tension headache in four cases, migrainous disorders not fulfilling above criteria in eight cases, headache of the tension-type not fulfilling above criteria in 12 cases and headache not classifiable in nine cases. Clinical features of headache are described in the text. Early developmental disorders (0-2 years), such as eating difficulties and sleep disorders, were detected in 18/35 children. Among patients older than 2 years, we also detected interictal somatic disorders (20 cases) such as sleep disorders, eating difficulties, enuresis and idiopathic vomiting. In 14/35 subjects, we identified psychosocial components playing a significant role at the onset of, and during, the headache.\nA better clinical definition of the disorder would make it easier to identify very young affected children and consequently to plan more specific therapeutic interventions, taking into account environmental and psychological factors. A diagnosis of idiopathic headache becomes particularly significant: according to our cases, despite their being limited in number, migraine and tension headache can be considered also as indices of individual or family related problems requiring appropriate psychiatric or psychological intervention. This stresses the need for a multidisciplinary team of specialists that would include a psychologist/ psychiatrist or headache specialist with specific training in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Old and forgotten: Alzheimer's lessons (opening lecture of the ABCDE Congress of Bologna).", "Abstract": "In Alois Alzheimer's times, an integrated approach combining neurology, psychiatry and neuropathology was natural, but those directions are growing apart from each other. Although no doubt these fields have developed into new fruitful disciplines, there is the danger of inconsistency and tunnel vision. In this lecture, a plea is made for a more integrative neuropsychiatric approach. This is demonstrated by means of new research findings from the Maastricht Behavior and Dementia Study, and the Maastricht MCI cohort study. A broad neuropsychiatric approach, in which both biological and psychosocial aspects are studied, does greater justice to patients with dementia. A too narrow view of dementia as a cognitive disorder not only frustrates research, but also is not at all helpful to patients and their carers, because the most harrowing aspects of the disease remain underexposed. Research on psychosocial aspects and care should be given a higher priority."}, {"Title": "The reduction of stigma and discrimination against older people with mental disorders: a challenge for the future.", "Abstract": "Aging of the world population risks to be accompanied by an increase of chronic health problems, and most particularly of mental health problems. To face these problems the organization of care and education in old age psychiatry is still quite low. If at inter -national level the body of knowledge and skills of the psychiatry of the elderly is today enough recognized it is very difficult to convince authorities at national and local level to recognize this discipline as a sub-specialty of psychiatry. Even when some resources exist at local level to support old people with mental disorders, very often these old persons do not look for care as consequence of the prevailing double stigma attached to mental disorders in general and to the end of life in particular. In order to promote changes of this situation, the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre of Lausanne realized a WHO-World Psychiatric Association (WPA) consensus meeting and statement on how to reduce the stigma and the discrimination against old persons with mental disorders, as well it has realized a survey in Europe on this specific subject of stigma and discrimination against these old persons. As education is one of the most important components of the strategy to reduce stigma and discrimination, 3 recent developments were done to promote this. The first one is a survey conducted by the section of old age psychiatry of WPA. The second one is the consensus statement on education in psychiatry of the elderly jointly published by WHO and WPA, and finally was the recent publication of a skill -based objectives for the training in the discipline.

However, the search for pathological substrates of varied mental conditions are leading to a reassessment of the role of minicolumns in mental disorders.

The first paper delineates the challenges for American psychiatry in moving buprenorphine forward into general practice. Most psychiatrists are unprepared to work with opiate-dependent patients or to use buprenorphine. The international successes with office-based buprenorphine from France and Australia are presented in the next papers, followed by presentations on several U.S. studies using buprenorphine in the community for detoxification and office-based maintenance. These experiences have thus far confirmed buprenorphine's utility and promise for opiate addiction treatment in the U.S. Finally, two national monitoring programs have been implemented to assess the public health impact of this new treatment opportunity. This opportunity has a three-year window, however, and a critical need will be to attract a sufficient number of physicians into prescribing buprenorphine/naloxone in order to allow our patients increased access to this treatment."}, {"Title": "Michigan assessment-screening test for alcohol and drugs (MAST/AD): evaluation in a clinical sample.", "Abstract": "In this study, we sought to evaluate a modification of the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test designed to include problems associated with other drug abuse/dependence besides alcohol. Scores of the lifetime Michigan Assessment-Screening Test/Alcohol-Drug (MAST/AD) were compared to other lifetime measures of substance abuse and dependence and to psychiatric scales reflecting current or recent symptoms. Two university medical centers with alcohol-drug programs located within departments of psychiatry hosted 520 patients with alcohol-drug-related diagnoses. Patients completed their own MAST/AD using a paper-and-pencil format. Based on interviews with the patient, a research associate rated the patients' substance-related problems on the Minnesota Substance Abuse Problem Scale (M-SAPS) and obtained information on lifetime treatment for substance abuse. An addictions psychiatrist determined abuse or dependence and made a current diagnosis of alcohol abuse/dependence only, drug abuse/dependence only, and alcohol plus drug abuse/dependence. The MAST/AD was highly correlated with the M-SAPS and several other measures of substance abuse morbidity. Patients with alcohol-only and drug-only diagnoses did not differ from one another on the MAST/AD, although both groups had lower scores than those with alcohol plus drug diagnoses. Current psychosocial morbidity as assessed by the patient and the psychiatrist was associated with the MAST/AD, although less strongly than with lifetime substance abuse measures. The lifetime MAST/AD demonstrates reliability as a severity measure for alcohol and/or drug abuse. With minor modification, this standard measure can be expanded from alcohol diagnoses to all substance diagnoses. This study in a clinical population did not demonstrate its utility as a screening instrument; additional work is needed to reveal its utility for this purpose."}, {"Title": "Experience from the first ACT programme in Denmark.

Before starting the clinical study, an epidemiological analysis of severe mental illness was performed. Severe mental illness was defined from register data on the basis of psychosis and high use of psychiatric services. Data concerning drop-out (inactive during a period), death and address were obtained. The point prevalence rate of severe mental illness on 31 December 2000 in S\u00f8nderjylland (SJ) county was 1.31/1000. The rate of inactive patients was 0.28/1000.

These developments have resulted in new guidelines and recommendations as to what is regarded to be an adequate treatment of the disorder. The objective of the present study was to examine if these developments have led to changes in the views on clinical management of childhood OCD among child psychiatry personnel in Norway. A national survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire addressing preferences and practices among clinicians in their assessment and management of OCD, the clinicians self-reported experienced treatment success, and need to develop clinical skills on assessing and treating childhood OCD. Seventy-nine clinicians (58.5%) responded. The results showed that cognitive/behavioural, family and medication approaches were preferred over psychodynamic and humanistic approaches in the management of OCD. The preferred cognitive/behavioural approach seems to be more cognitive than behavioural, and only one-third of clinicians reported frequent use of anxiety-provoking methods in treatment of childhood OCD. Clinicians that self-rated the Clinical Global Improvement Scale on their last treated OCD case indicated moderate treatment success. Because of low numbers of OCD cases in the clinics, the majority of clinicians are rated as inexperienced in the management of the disorder and results show a need for adequate training opportunities. It is concluded that clinicians have accommodated to recommended standards in the management of childhood OCD, but some results are contradictory and do not justify conclusive statements. The study needs to be supplemented by research focusing on more specific elements of the preferred treatments, thus narrowing the scope of the present study."}, {"Title": "Quality of life with OCD. A self-reported survey among members of the Danish OCD Association.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is today the fourth most frequent diagnosis issued within psychiatry. OCD can be quite incapacitating for the affected person and often becomes chronic. The purpose of the present study has been to help illuminate the character of the quality of life among the members of the Danish OCD Association. The data was compiled from 406 questionnaires sent out to all those members of the Danish OCD Association who had reported to suffer from OCD. The level of response was 54.4%. Persons with OCD signalled striking influences on their academic, occupational and social functions and thereby a corresponding influence on their quality of life in general. Emerging were significant levels of comorbidity and suicidal tendency. The time interval between symptom onset and the establishment of a correct diagnosis was found to be 13 years in average in this study. There appeared to be a marked tardiness in treatment as a consequence of the latency period between onset of symptoms and the establishment of a diagnosis. This has proven to be of importance in relation to the provision of proper treatment, the developmental course of the OCD condition, and not least in the quality of life for the person with OCD as well as his/her family members."}, {"Title": "Is alcoholism a self-induced disease? A survey among doctors in Aarhus, Denmark and in Mainz, Germany.", "Abstract": "The intent of this study was to explore differences in views concerning the statements \"alcoholism is a disease\" and \"alcoholism is a self-induced disease\" among doctors in two cities from two contrasting countries, relating to different official definitions of alcoholism, namely Denmark, where alcoholism is related to ways of lifestyle and Germany, where alcoholism is related to preliminary diseases. The data come from a postal anonymous survey, carried out between January and February 2000 in Aarhus and Mainz, sent to general practitioners and hospital doctors from surgery, internal medicine and psychiatry. The identified sample was n = 572, and the response rate = 66% (n = 374). As opposed to doctors in Aarhus (73.7%), significantly more doctors in Mainz (92.4%) described alcoholism as a disease, but independent of nationality, about half of the samples (no gender, age and healthcare settings differences) also agreed that \"alcoholism is a self-induced disease\". The governmental position on alcoholism seems to have an influence on doctors' evaluation: in Denmark, where alcoholism is defined as a disease of lifestyle, doctors in Aarhus were less likely to describe alcoholism as a disease than in Mainz, where alcoholism is seen as a preliminary disease. The ideological background for these differences is connected to the different influence of the temperance groups on the alcohol field -- less in Denmark and more in Germany. However, half of the doctors in Aarhus and Mainz viewed alcoholism as a self-induced disease and so indirectly assumed that alcoholics are responsible for their self-afflicted disease."}, {"Title": "Prescription of psychotropic drugs in adolescent psychiatry wards in Finland.", "Abstract": "This point-prevalence study was designed to assess adolescent psychiatrists' practices of prescribing psychotropic drugs in hospital settings, and to compare the practices between the years 1991 and 1999.

The sample represented 49% in 1991 and 29% in 1999 of all adolescent psychiatric inpatient beds in Finland. Of the patients included in the study, 30% (20/66) in 1991 and 68% (53/78) in 1999 were treated with drugs. The increase was biggest in the proportion of depressive patients and in the proportion of depressive patients receiving drugs.

There was a continued increase in the number and percentage of flexible SpRs over the period 1995-2001. The rate slowed in 2001 and fell in three regions, suggesting a possible adverse effect of the New Pay Deal for junior doctors.

According to Helmut's article published in the October 2003 issue of Science, in the coming decade researchers and psychiatrists will be called upon to propose a basis for the psychiatric diagnostic system of the future. I propose a new etiology-oriented diagnostic system for psychiatry by integrating two recently emerging bodies of knowledge, one regarding plasticity and the other involving complex systems. Plasticity refers to all brain processes involved in dynamic alterations within communicating neuronal ensembles or networks, in the brain. Complexity refers to certain formulations from system theories relevant to brain dynamics and plasticity. It is proposed to divide plasticity processes into three types based on time domains: (1) \"developmental plasticity\", (2) \"tuning plasticity\" and (3) \"fast stabilizing plasticity\". Each type of plasticity is related to different complexity models achieved by the brain, developmental plasticity is life-long brain organization, it is related to state-space configurations molded into brain representations internalized via processes such as Hebbian learning. Tuning plasticity is related to \"matching complexity\" a measure of adaptability between internal configurations in the brain-system and externally originating event stimuli. Fast stabilizing plasticity is related to \"neural complexity\" a measure of neural network integration in the brain. Neural complexity meets the mental requirement to extract important features from different sensory inputs and to simultaneously generate coherent perceptual and cognitive states, thus balancing specialized segregated brain processes with coherent globally integrated whole brain activity. Mental disorders can be reconceptualized as disorders of plasticity resulting in disturbances of state-space brain configurations, matching and neural complexities. Personality disorders result from altered internal representations of the psychosocial environment. Depression and anxiety have been recently linked to alterations of adaptive neuronal plasticity thus reconceptualized as disorders of matching complexity. Finally, psychoses, including schizophrenia spectrum disorders, are reconceptualized as disturbances of neural complexity resulting in altered fast stabilizing plasticity. The new diagnostic system generates testable predictions regarding diagnosis and treatments of mental disorders which may be the future of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "'The vehicle of success': theoretical and empirical perspectives on the therapeutic alliance in psychotherapy and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The importance of the 'therapeutic alliance' has long been recognized in psychotherapeutic theory and research, but is also increasingly researched in psychiatry. This paper examines the clinical and empirical literature on the alliance and asks, first, whether the concept is unrecognizably distorted when it travels from the psychoanalytic context to other therapies and to psychiatry, or when translated into research instruments; and, second, how we are to understand the apparent anomaly whereby its proponents have defined it as a 'vehicle' for treatment rather than curative, whereas quantitative research increasingly associates it with outcome. This paper reviews the evolution of the concept in clinical theory, traces the development of empirical research on the subject and considers its use in psychiatry. It argues that the empirical research misleadingly suggests a curative paradigm, and that it may be unable to illuminate some of the clinical controversies, although its implications for theory demand consideration. It argues for the retention of the alliance concept in psychiatry distinct from the broader spectrum of the 'relationship'. Finally, it argues that the debate about the concept's curative properties may, paradoxically, be more pressing within psychotherapy than psychiatry, and endorses calls for more theoretically driven empirical research into the alliance."}, {"Title": "[Adverse effects of lithium treatment and safety routines].", "Abstract": "Successful lithium treatment of manic disorders was reported in 1949 by John Cade. This marked the beginning of the pharmacological era in psychiatry. In spite of the emergence of alternative drugs with antimanic and moodstabilising properties, lithium remains the primary long-term treatment for preventing relapse of bipolar disorders. Among the adverse effects of lithium treatment are unintentional lithium intoxication, nephropathy, hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, diarrhoea, tremor, weight gain, and effects on the fetus and the newborn child. Early detection or prevention of adverse effects, particularly lithium intoxication, is vital for safety. Therefore, P-lithium and P-creatinine are assessed every 4 months (and pre-lithium) while thyroid and parathyroid function, weight, 24 h consumption of liquids (or 24 h urinary output), B-glucose, and blood pressure are assessed annually (and pre-lithium). Urinary concentrating capacity and glomerular filtration rate are always measured after 5 years of lithium treatment, and always when clinically indicated. Patient education and annual reinforcement of his/her knowledge of pertinent aspects of the treatment and of risk factors for lithium intoxication are important aspects for ensuring safety."}, {"Title": "Nursing based evidence: moving beyond evidence-based practice in mental health nursing.", "Abstract": "Various authors suggest mental health nursing is dominated by knowledge borrowed from psychiatry, pharmacology and the behavioural sciences. These disciplines favour knowledge developed using quantitative methodologies so they and evidence-based practice (EBP) and evidence-based nursing (EBN), increasingly called for in mental health nursing, fit seamlessly together. Nevertheless, as these movements dismiss qualitative approaches to knowledge (evidence) development, I argue against the move toward EBP/EBN in mental health nursing. This is because the specialty's primary interests - human experiences of illness/health care and human relationships, often do not lend themselves to being quantitatively researched. Using nursing examples, I demonstrate how qualitative research, wholly unacceptable in relation to EBP/EBN quality of evidence scales, is indispensable to mental health nursing. The need for evidence arising from qualitative research in no way precludes the need for quantitatively derived evidence. Indeed, the specialty's twofold interest - the work of nurses with clients and the explication of phenomena which inform practice, require diverse knowledge and thus, diverse research approaches. This twofold interest defines the area of mental health nursing practice, and knowledge informing it is referred to as nursing based evidence (NBE). Because it values multiple approaches to knowledge development, NBE provides a way to articulate the specialty's distinct contribution to the health care of people experiencing mental illness and advances mental health nursing."}, {"Title": "[Case reports of devitalization because of depression.

Clinical interviewers in community samples should probably identify cases that are closer to those seen in clinical settings. The greatest advantage of using clinical interviewers consists of the immediate assessment of a possible psychopathology, i.e. the evaluation of current disorders.\nTwo thousand three hundred and sixty-three citizens from the community of Sesto Fiorentino, Italy, were interviewed by their own general practitioners using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Positive cases for any lifetime psychiatric disorder as well as a random sample of the negative cases were re-interviewed by psychiatrists or trained residents in psychiatry using the Florence Psychiatric Interview (FPI).\nThe point prevalence for any current disorder was 8.7%; the two disorders with the highest prevalence were generalised anxiety disorder (2.9%) and major depressive episode (2.7%). The figures increase about 50% when the sub-threshold sequelae of previous disorders are considered. Current comorbidity was generally high. The one-year prevalence of any disorder was 10.6%. Ninety-two percent of the cases sought help, 82% were being treated at the moment of interview. Social impairment was considerable.\nThe period prevalence rates for most of the disorders considered were generally comparable with the range defined by previous studies conducted in other Western countries, despite using different methodologies.

Exploratory analyses identified additional patient-control differences for normalized K* (eg, inferior frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule), most of which, once corrected for 38 multiple comparisons, lost their significance. Morphometric measurements of the cingulate cortex divisions confirmed that the reduction of normalized K* in depressed patients was not attributable to a reduction in gray matter volume. Normalized K* in the anterior cingulate cortex did not correlate with ratings of depression severity collected at the time of scan.\nReduction of normalized K*, an index of serotonin synthesis, in parts of the limbic and paralimbic cortices may contribute to the biochemical alterations associated with MD."}, {"Title": "Genes and environment: nosology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric syndromal nosology is defined in terms of prototypical symptoms and course.

These discharges occur in about 1.5 to 2.4% of children; only 10% of them suffer from epileptic seizures.\nThis paper reviews genetic, epidemiological, radiological, neurophysiologic, metabolic and neuropsychological findings in children with rolandic discharges.\nThe epileptologic course is favorable, seizures and EEG features usually resolve completely at puberty. In contrast to former assumptions, symptoms range from infrequent seizures to neuropsychological deficits and behavior problems, even in children without overt seizures. The impact of rolandic spikes on the development of affected children and their behavior is unclear. Two models try to elucidate the relation between EEG discharges and neuropsychological disorders. The first regards neuropsychological disturbances as transient cognitive impairment due to epileptiform discharges; the second model strengthens the role of a hereditary impairment of brain maturation.\nThe benefit of pharmacotherapy for treating neuropsychiatric symptoms in children with rolandic spikes but without overt seizures remains to be clarified."}, {"Title": "[Chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome and its relevance for child and adolescent psychiatry.

We have operationalised this condition as a major depressive episode (MDE) with three or more intra-episode hypomanic signs and symptoms (DMX3). Of 320 consecutive bipolar II outpatients, presenting for MDE treatment and interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, modified to permit the systematic evaluation of hypomanic features during the index MDE, 200 met our criteria for DMX3 (62.5%). When compared with the remaining non-DMX bipolar II, they had significantly earlier age at onset, higher percentage of females, atypical features and bipolar family history. Multivariate logistic regression ofintra-MDE hypomanic signs and symptoms found evidence supporting an \"excited depression\" subtype (defined by the core feature of psychomotor agitation, and further characterised by talkativeness, irritable mood and distractability) and a \"depression with flight of ideas\" subtype (defined by the core feature of racing/crowded thoughts, and further characterised by risky pleasurable impulses including, among others, those with intense sexual arousal). We thereby documented the existence of two distinct DMX subtypes which testify to the clinical acumen of Kraepelin (and his pupil Weygandt) who in 1899 described these two subforms of depressive mixed states in more severely ill hospitalised patients."}, {"Title": "Historical review: Autointoxication and focal infection theories of dementia praecox.", "Abstract": "The popularity of theories of autointoxication and focal infection in general medicine and dentistry in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries led Emil Kraepelin and others to speculate that dementia praecox was caused by a poisoning of the brain from toxins produced in other parts of the body, notably the sex glands, the intestines and the mouth. Emil Kraepelin's commitment to the autointoxication theory is ignored in the literature on the history of psychiatry due to the focus of historians and clinicians on the major contributions of Kraepelin's methods of clinical psychopathology. Besides heredity, autointoxication and focal infection were the other most dominant theories of the organic aetiology of dementia praecox in the first three decades of its existence as a nosological entity in psychiatry. Rational treatments for dementia praecox that followed logically from these aetio-logical theories were colonic irrigations and major abdominal surgeries such as appendicostomies, colectomies and the removal of presumably infected ovaries, testes and other organs associated with reproduction.

Although ETS originates mainly from smoking patients, both non-compliance from patients and employees with existing bans resulted in non-smokers being exposed to ETS. Due to non-compliance, ETS exposure was quite high when there is a general smoking ban (designated areas option). Only with a complete ban was compliance good and employees sufficiently protected from ETS exposure. Psychiatrists, psychologists, physicians, attendants, and nurses were most concerned about resistance from patients, partly because of the fear of infringing on patients' freedom to smoke.\nComplete smoking bans are the only way to fully protect those working in psychiatry from ETS exposure, mainly because general smoking bans are not sufficiently complied with. Communication strategies to improve compliance with complete bans are crucial to protect those working in psychiatry from ETS. Compliance could be improved by addressing the belief that the ban will effectively result in less ETS exposure and the issue of patients' freedom to smoke versus employees' right to work in a smoke-free environment."}, {"Title": "The use of international videoconferencing as a strategy for teaching medical students about transcultural psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Videoconferencing is an innovative method that potentially allows medical students exposure to international teachers in refugee mental health who would otherwise be inaccessible.

Interviews indicate that patients of all three therapeutic systems showed improvement after follow-up assessments and that several patients had radically divergent experiences with each of the three therapies; each therapy was found by some to be helpful and by others to be ineffective. These findings suggest that a greater availability of distinct forms of therapy makes it more likely that an individual will find a therapy to which he or she responds well, an insight that helps interpret World Health Organization-sponsored studies which examined mental disorders in developed and developing country sites and found a better outcome for these disorders in developing country centers. Although several studies have attempted to account for this difference in outcome, none have done so by considering that the 'developing' country sites in the World Health Organization studies are all places that have a greater availability of diverse forms of therapy when compared with the 'developed' sites."}, {"Title": "A psychoanalytic psychotherapist working within psychiatry: covert and overt functions.", "Abstract": "Within psychiatric practice, psychotherapy occupies a unique role.

Nineteenth-century alienists such as J.-M. Charcot and Henry Maudsley developed critiques of supernatural phenomena in an attempt to pathologize religious experience. Modern historians have reanalyzed these critiques, representing them as strategies in medical professionalization. These accounts all maintain an oddly bifurcated approach to the perceived conflict, treating demonology, as a passive and unchanging set of practices, while medicine is depicted as an active and aggressive agent. An examination of early twentieth-century demonological literature reveals a very different story. Fundamentalists and Pentecostalists engaged with the problems of conversion and possession, developing sophisticated models of the normal and the pathological in spiritual experience. Their writings drew upon medical and psychiatric sources ranging widely from Pastorian germ theory to Jacksonian neurology.

The evaluative study on an age-group random sample survey (n=95) of patients and parents at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of Heidelberg includes success of treatment, experience of treatment and satisfaction with treatment by means of specially constructed and parallelized questionnaires for patients, parents and therapists. Apart from the extent of subjectively experienced changes in precisely defined success variables, not only agreements and differences were studied, but also connections between success of treatment, experience of treatment and satisfaction with treatment as well as influences of success variables and experience variables on treatment satisfaction. Parents', patients' and therapists' evaluations of the treatment in regard of most success variables were all positive. At the end of treatment a perspective convergence was noticeable in some variables. The pressure on the parents requires special therapeutic attention. In the sense of therapy evaluation the change in the way the problem was viewed proved to be a worthwile success criterium. From the patients' and parents' point of view the change in the problem \"as a whole\" is mainly characterized by a positive change in emotional disposition. The therapeutic atmosphere and organisation of therapeutic relationships were highly appreciated by patients and parents. All in all patients, parents and therapists were highly satisfied with inpatient treatment. The correlations found between the grade of success, experience of treatment and satisfaction with treatment were clearly positive. On the patients' side treatment satisfaction was dictated more by their experiences during the treatment, whereas on the parents' side the success of treatment proved to be the stronger factor."}, {"Title": "[Functional psychosis in childhood and adolescence].", "Abstract": "To review the literature about functional psychosis in children and adolescents, allowing pediatricians to recognize the pathology in their daily work routine.\nClassical textbooks of child and adolescent psychiatry; search of MEDLINE and Lilacs databases (1993 to 2003). Computerized search methods were combined with manual search of the literature.\nThis article is structured in topics, trying to define and classify psychosis in childhood and adolescence, with schizophrenia being the main disorder. The article stresses the difficulties for the diagnosis in children, and addresses the main treatment guidelines.\nSchizophrenia beginning in childhood, or very-early-onset schizophrenia, is a very rare pathology, almost 50-fold less frequent than early-onset schizophrenia (appearing at age 15 or later). Childhood-onset schizophrenia is a separate disorder, different from infantile autism, not only in terms of conceptual issues, but also in terms of phenomenology, genetics and associated clinical and neurological issues."}, {"Title": "Decreasing assault occurrence on a psychogeriatric ward: an agitation management model.", "Abstract": "An agitation management model providing staff education, quantitative assessment of agitation, and emphasized psychosocial interventions was introduced on a geriatric psychiatry ward for male patients. A within-subjects comparison was made of Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) scores and frequency of committing assault under pre- and post-intervention conditions. Among participants (N = 8) who finished the 72-week study, CMAI scores did not differ significantly under either of the study conditions (p > .05, two-tailed t test). Twenty-nine assaults occurred during the pre-intervention time period and six assaults occurred during the post-intervention time period. According to analysis with the Wilcoxon signed ranks test, the distribution of assaults differed significantly between the two time periods (p < .05, two-tailed). Among individuals who were excluded from the intervention because of lack of consent, assaults increased over the same two time periods. Psychosocial interventions intended to reduce agitation among elderly men with dementia may not necessarily serve to decrease agitation, but may serve to decrease assault occurrence."}, {"Title": "Convergent and discriminant validity of three measures of depressive personality disorder.", "Abstract": "Sixty-eight outpatients from a veterans' administration psychiatry clinic and community mental health center were assessed with 3 measures of depressive personality disorder (DPD)-the Diagnostic Interview for Depressive Personality Disorder (Gunderson, Phillips, Triebwasser, & Hirschfeld, 1994), the Depressive Personality Disorder Inventory (Huprich, Margrett, Barthelemy, & Fine, 1996), and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders (First, Gibbon, Spitzer, Williams, & Benjamin, 1997a)-to evaluate their convergent and discriminant validity. Evidence supporting the measures' validity was mixed. The rate of convergence of depressive personality diagnoses across 3 measures was less than optimal, but the degree of intercorrelation among the measures was strong. Although depressive personality scores had moderate levels of intercorrelations with other personality disorders, the degree of intercorrelation decreased substantially after controlling for depressive symptoms. I conclude that further work is needed to strengthen the validity of measures of DPD."}, {"Title": "Role and attitude of companions on geriatric psychiatry outpatient visits in Taiwan.", "Abstract": "The purpose of the present paper was to investigate the role and attitude of people who accompanied geriatric patients to an outpatient psychiatric clinic. The study was conducted at a large university hospital in Taiwan. Participants included 108 patients aged 65 years and older who were seen for their initial psychiatric visit; 81 patients were accompanied. All accompanying people were interviewed to obtain their assumed role and attitude during the visit. Data were gathered prospectively; statistical analyses were performed using SPSS-PC. Accompanied patients (75% of participants) were older than those in the unaccompanied group. Most patients (53.1%) were accompanied by adult children who lived with them. Of the accompanying spouses, 48% were described as a supporter, and 60% showed a positive attitude. Most of the accompanying children acted as critics and speakers. Accompanying people whose responsible patients reported insomnia and suicide attempts showed a significantly positive attitude, whereas people who accompanied alcoholic patients were more negative and assumed a critic role. Many accompanying people requested further examination and drug treatment and expressed concern that the patient may be mentally ill. The role and attitude of accompanying people on the geriatric patient encounter are important factors in promoting patient-doctor communication and trust."}, {"Title": "The neurobiology of dopamine signaling.", "Abstract": "The brain contains 2 major groups of dopamine neurons. One is located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamic median eminence and is involved in neuroendocrine regulation. The other, which is the subject of this article, is located in the ventral mesencephalon and projects to the forebrain. Although dopamine neurons are few (<1/100 000 brain neurons), they play an important role in regulating several aspects of basic brain function. They are necessary for the normal tasks of the regions they innervate, including motor behavior, motivation, and working memory. Dopamine neurons are also a central element in the brain reward system that controls the learning of many behaviors. Disappearance of nigrostriatal neurons results in Parkinson disease, whereas blockade of dopamine receptors has therapeutic effects in psychosis. Finally, artificial increase in dopamine transmission is the common mechanism of action of drugs of abuse that leads to addiction. Understanding how dopamine works is a major goal of neurobiology. Much progress has been accomplished in identifying the intracellular signaling pathways that underlie the immediate actions of dopamine and account for its long-term effects on brain properties. Recent findings allow us to identify molecules that may represent future therapeutic targets in neurology and psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Integrating mental health services into primary HIV care for women: the Whole Life project.", "Abstract": "The high rate of mental health problems in HIV-infected women jeopardizes the health of this vulnerable population, and constitutes a mandate for integrating mental health services into HIV primary care.

The response rate was 42% (n = 1204). We recruited patients from a Canadian on-line survey (n = 67) and from a local mental health clinic (n = 90).\nPsychiatrists had lower levels of beliefs and practices than did patients and the general population. In both groups, 47% felt there was \"often or always\" a place to include spirituality in psychiatric assessment, although the perceived importance differed. Among patients, 53% felt it important to have this issue addressed, and 24% considered the psychiatrist's spiritual interest important in their choice of psychiatrist. Barriers to addressing the issue of spirituality and mental health related to psychiatrists' concern regarding its appropriateness and patients' perception that interest is lacking. Psychiatrists' own beliefs and practices were strong predictors of spiritual inquiry.\nAlthough psychiatrists report lower levels of spiritual and religious belief than do patients, they acknowledge that it is important to include this topic in patient care. Increased discussion and education may lower reported barriers to including spirituality and religion in routine psychiatric assessment."}, {"Title": "Advances in psychotherapy education.", "Abstract": "Acquiring expertise in psychotherapy is central to the professional development of psychiatrists able to employ a broad therapeutic repertoire in their clinical practice. This article reviews how postgraduate psychiatry programs address this important aspect of training. We present the results of a national survey of psychotherapy education in Canadian psychiatry residency programs. The results highlight significant advances over the past decade in curriculum, in teaching methods, and in evaluation. These include training in evidence-based, manualized, time-limited therapies such as cognitive-behavioural and interpersonal therapy, greater attention to evaluating competence, and integrating electronic technology. Trends and advances in postgraduate and continuing medical psychotherapy education programs are considered in association with principles of adult learning. Health education research endorses the provision of longitudinal training programs that integrate learning and practice. We discuss issues related to the development of expertise, the importance of educational communities of practitioners, and the importance of attending to both educational process and outcomes, with a view to more effectively translating psychotherapy practice guidelines into sustained improvements in practice behaviours."}, {"Title": "[Clinical psychoacoustics can support an objective diagnosis of schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "This article deals with a new branch of research in psychiatry focusing upon schizophrenia in the first hand. Methods of investigating psychoacoustic aberrations in this disease have been developed during the last twenty years at our laboratory; Unit of Clinical psychoacoustics, Division of Psychiatry, Dept of Clinical Neuroscience, Lund University (www.psykiatr.lu.se/psykoaclab). Schizophrenic persons show dysfunctions at the psychophysiological level as displayed by many psychoacoustic mechanisms such as streaming, restoration and contralateral induction of sounds. These dysfunctions may influence general cognitive and perceptual processes and partly explain clinically observed symptoms of the disease. Further investigations on the efforts to elucidate normal functioning of the psychoacoustic processes by functional magnetic resonance imaging, auditory brainstem response and via animal models are described. One immediate aim of all the studies is to be able to demonstrate objective measurements of the schizophrenic aberrations using psychoacoustic tests. This would help supporting the diagnosis, setting early diagnosis or guide therapeutic decisions."}, {"Title": "L -5-Hydroxytryptophan treatment of sleep terrors in children.", "Abstract": "To test the hypothesis that the administration of L -5-hydroxytryptophan (L -5-HTP) might exert beneficial effects on sleep terrors, we carried out an open pharmacological trial in a group of children with sleep terrors compared to a group of children with the same disorder but without L -5-HTP treatment. Participants in the trial were 45 children (34 males and 11 females; age range 3.2-10.6 years), referred to the Sleep Centre of the Department of Developmental Neurology and Psychiatry of the University of Rome \"La Sapienza\", affected by sleep terrors. All subjects underwent: (1) complete medical and sleep history; (2) complete neurological examination and EEG recording whilst awake and sleeping, (3) a structured sleep diary for 2 months, (4) after 1 month, all subjects were examined again from the clinical and EEG points of view and (5) after 6 months, a structured interview in order to evaluate the clinical outcome. After the first visit, L -5-HTP was administered (2 mg/kg per day) at bedtime to 31 randomly selected patients for a single period of 20 consecutive days. After 1 month of treatment, 29/31 (93.5%) of patients showed a positive response. In the comparison group without drug therapy, after 1 month, the episodes disappeared only in four children (28.6%) while ten children (71.4%) showed the persistence of episodes with the same frequency as before. After 6 months, 26/31 (83.9%) of children treated with L -5HTP were sleep terror-free, while in five children (16.1%) sleep terror episodes persisted. Of the children in the comparison group, ten (71.4%) continued to show sleep terrors at 6-month follow-up.\nto our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the efficacy of a new drug treatment for sleep terrors.

Psychiatry 44 (2003) 331] was used to assess cognitive complaints in 73 subjects with schizophrenia. Visuo-spatial tests of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) [Cogn. Neuropsychiatry 3 (1998) 45] were administered as objective measures.\nCognitive complaints in several cognitive domains were mainly correlated with a true difficulty in memory. Higher SSTICS attention scores, i.e. increased complaints, were associated with poorer CANTAB explicit visual memory and planning performances. Higher SSTICS executive functioning scores were associated with poorer CANTAB explicit visual memory scores.\nThese findings suggest that outpatients with schizophrenia express some cognitive difficulties. However, the cognitive nature of these subjective complaints does not strictly correspond with objective performances. These results also suggest that theoretical constructs of cognitive functions do not always have ecological validity. Thus, subjective cognitive complaints should be taken into account in assessment of patient well-being, but cannot be used as a substitute to objective cognitive measures. The simultaneous use of subjective and objective measures of cognitive dysfunction may provide a more complete picture of individual rehabilitation targets in patients with schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Psychological trauma: psychiatry and the law in conflict.", "Abstract": "To contrast the psychiatric and legal construct of psychological trauma, with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as the reference disorder.\nLiterature relevant to DSM-IV PTSD definition of a traumatic event (Criterion A) was assessed.

Cyproheptadine has been shown in medical samples to stimulate weight gain. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 28 consecutive pediatric psychiatry outpatients prescribed cyproheptadine for weight loss or insomnia while on stimulants. Of these, 4 patients never took cyproheptadine consistently, and 3 discontinued it within the first 7 days due to intolerable side effects. Data were analyzed for 21 other patients (age range 4-15 years) who continued with 4-8 mg of cyproheptadine nightly (mean final dose = 4.9 mg/day) for at least 14 days (mean duration = 104.7 days). Most had lost weight on stimulant alone (mean weight loss was 2.1 kg, mean weight velocity was -19.3 g/day). All 21 gained weight taking concomitant cyproheptadine, with a mean gain of 2.2 kg (paired t = 6.87, p < 0.0001) and a mean weight velocity of 32.3 g/day.

Although there is nothing new about the occurrence of this conduct it has been discussed in psychiatry more intensely in recent years. As a result there are a few attempts at classification, without any claim of general validity. Patterns of stalking behaviour reflect a wide spectrum from aggressive actions in the course of conflicts in a relationship to schizophrenia. Thus, it is not adequate to classify this as a psychiatric disorder per se.

In countries where high rates of immigration have been long-standing such as Britain and the Netherlands, these increased rates have also been seen in the second generation of migrants. This has impacted on psychiatry significantly with regard to the aetiology, diagnosis, and treatment of schizophrenia.\nWe reviewed the literature to summarise the available evidence about the phenomenon across the European countries where these findings have been reported. Comparisons of the findings between countries were highlighted to establish their impact on psychiatry and to identify areas and implications for future research.\nThe history of this kind of research is longest in Britain and has established increased risk for non-white migrants, with Caribbean and African patients being especially vulnerable. Caribbean migrants to the Netherlands have also been found to be at increased risk, but they are predominantly of Indo-Caribbean ethnicity. In the other European countries, East and West African migrants have been implicated in some countries, while European migrants have been implicated in other countries. Social inequalities, family fragmentation and urbanicity seem to be the main hypotheses proposed for these increased rates, though, in some countries where asylum seekers and refugees form the largest group of migrants, the stress of the migratory process itself may be implicated. These may all interact with genetic vulnerability and substance abuse.\nEthnicity and differences in dominant language emerge as major structural references in this new epistemology of psychosis and both the causes and the effects on psychopathology may be filtered through an experience of social disadvantage in an urban environment."}, {"Title": "The feminization of psychiatry? Some ruminations.", "Abstract": "This article considers the position of women in psychiatry today from the historical perspective of feminism. Feminism in medicine demands the inclusion of the traditional priorities of women: collaboration and cooperation over competition and hierarchy, compassionate care over technology and automation, flexible care for the individual in a social context over the study of units of diseased organs. These themes, in addition to the care of women and children, were prominent in the lives of early women physicians and again in the 1970s and 1980s. The number of women in psychiatry has increased. However, their influence is scant and feminist goals are again submerged. At the same time psychiatry has become increasingly interested in the organ (brain) at the expense of the individual person. Women need a new awakening. They must use their new presence to assert feminine values in patient care and protect themselves from becoming provider units on the assembly line."}, {"Title": "The path from initial inquiry to initiation of treatment for social anxiety disorder in an anxiety disorders specialty clinic.", "Abstract": "Efficacious treatments for social anxiety disorder have become increasingly available, with approximately three-quarters of treatment completers showing significant improvement [Arch.

Three \"critical points\" associated with high pretreatment attrition were identified: scheduling an initial interview, attending a scheduled initial interview, and initiating a treatment program after receiving a principal diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. Several demographic variables (e.g., level of education, race) were related to attendance at the initial interview. However, no differences were found between those who did and did not initiate treatment on demographic variables, symptom severity, or quality of life.

A significant relationship between genetic variation in the cytochrome P450 system and drug-induced adverse effects may exist for certain medications. Finally, a number of independent studies point to a significant effect of a dopamine D(3) receptor polymorphism on susceptibility to tardive dyskinesia.\nInitial research into the pharmacogenetics of psychotropic drug response suggests that specific genes may influence phenotypes associated with psychotropic drug administration. These results remain preliminary and will require further replication and validation. New developments in molecular biology, human genomic information, statistical methods, and bioinformatics are ongoing and could pave the way for the next generation of pharmacogenetic studies in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The Staffing of Inpatient Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services.", "Abstract": "\u2002 There is a need for more accurate information regarding the staffing of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric inpatient units.

In addition, the recent advancements in the study of neurogenesis in the adult brain force the change of the therapeutic strategy of mental disorders. The fact that the central nervous tissues can repair even after the maturation and that the replacement of neurons continues during adulthood will alter our understanding about their pathogenesis. The action of several psychiatric medications such as antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and electroconvulsive therapy is converging at neurogenesis and/or neuroprotection. When the validity of the \"neurogenesis/neuroprotection hypothesis\" of psychiatric medication will be proved in psychiatric practice, we can establish a more rational and more effective treatment of mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Novel antipsychotics in bipolar and schizoaffective mania.", "Abstract": "Novel antipsychotics are increasingly used in the treatment of bipolar and schizoaffective mania.

Studies have shown that users generally find the service provided by psychiatry unsatisfactory. One reason for this may be a lack of confidence on the part of psychiatrists to take on such work. We focus on whether future psychiatrists feel that they learn enough about this topic.\nWe asked 60 residents in psychiatry in various stages of their graduate medical education to evaluate their own knowledge or skills in 109 fields expected to be mastered by a specialist in psychiatry. Items with high relevance to mental retardation were compared with other items of similar relevance to psychiatric practice.\nThe residents felt they lacked skills/knowledge in psychiatric and medicolegal fields mainly concerning people with mental retardation. In fields that were highly relevant for both general psychiatric practice and mental retardation the residents reported higher confidence.\nThe efforts during the reform process to secure psychiatric services for people with mental retardation are not reflected in the training of new psychiatrists or in their confidence in their ability to undertake such work."}, {"Title": "Further evidence for a possible association between serotonin transporter gene and lithium prophylaxis in mood disorders.", "Abstract": "We previously reported an association between the functional polymorphism in the upstream regulatory region of the serotonin transporter gene (SERTPR) and the prophylactic efficacy of lithium in a sample of 201 Italian subjects affected by Mood disorders. The aim of the present study was to replicate analyses on an independent sample. In total, 83 subjects affected by Bipolar disorder were recruited in the Mood Disorders Clinic of the Eginition Hospital of the Athens University, Medical School Department of Psychiatry. All patients were administered with lithium as prophylactic therapy and they were prospectively observed for at least 3 years. Subjects were typed for their SERTPR variant using polymerase chain reaction techniques. SERTPR variants were associated with lithium outcome among those subjects who had few manic episodes before lithium treatment and, as a trend, among subjects who received a high daily dose of lithium (> or =1200 mg/die). In both cases, subjects with the l/l variant showed a higher probability to develop an illness episode within 3 years of prophylactic treatment with lithium. The present study confirmed our previous observation of a better response of SERTPR*l/s carriers, but could not confirm a poor efficacy in subjects with the SERTPR*s/s genotype. Notwithstanding the conflicting results, SERTPR variants are a possible liability factor for lithium long-term efficacy in mood disorders. Further studies on independent and large samples are required to determine the reliability and direction of the possible association between SERTPR variants and lithium outcome."}, {"Title": "Methylomics in psychiatry: Modulation of gene-environment interactions may be through DNA methylation.", "Abstract": "Fine-tuning of neuronal connections during development is regulated through environmental interactions. Some fine-tuning occurs through changes in gene expression and/or epigenetic gene-specific DNA methylation states. DNA methylation occurs by transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine to cytosine residues in the dinucleotide sequence CpG. Although CpG sequences spread throughout the genome are usually heavily methylated, those occurring in CpG islands in the promoter regions of genes are less methylated. In most cases, the extent of DNA methylation correlates with the extent of gene inactivation. Other known epigenetic mechanisms include histone deacetylation and chromatin remodeling, RNA inhibition, RNA modification, and DNA rearrangement. Exposure memory expressed as epigenetic DNA modifications allows genomic plasticity and short-term adaptation of each generation to their environment. Environmental factors that affect DNA methylation include diet, proteins, drugs, and hormones. Induced methylation changes may produce altered gene response upon subsequent hormonal stimulation. The gene-specific DNA methylation state may be preserved upon transmission through mitosis and meiosis. An increasing amount of data implicates a role for DNA methylation in multi-factorial psychiatric disorders. For example, L-methionine treatment can exacerbate psychosis; while valproate, a drug producing hypomethylated DNA, reduces such symptoms. Hypermethylation of the promoter region of the RELN gene correlates with reduced gene expression. This gene's protein Reelin, which is necessary for neuronal migration and synaptogenesis, is reduced in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, suggesting hypermethylation of the promoter region in these disorders. Some evidence implicates methylation of the promoter regions of the DRD2 and HTR2A genes in schizophrenia and mood disorders as well. DNA methylation usually increases with age, although hypomethylation of the promoter region of the amyloid A4 precursor gene during aging may play a role in Alzheimer's disease. More studies are needed to define the role of methylomics and other epigenetic phenomena in the nervous system."}, {"Title": "[Bioequivalence and therapeutic equivalence in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Many psychotropics on the market are generic forms and essentially similar products.

These instruments improved the reliability of the data collection and interrater reliability allowing greater homogenisation of the subjects taking part in clinical research, essential factor to ensure the reproducibility of the results. The diagnostic instruments, conversely to the clinical traditional diagnostic processes allow a systematic and exhaustive exploration of disorders, diagnostic criteria but also severity levels, and duration. The format of the data collection, including the order of exploration of the symptoms, is fixed. The formulation of the questions is tested to be univocal, in order to avoid confusions. In child and adolescent, researches in pharmacology and epidemiology increased a lot in the last decade and the standardisation of diagnostic procedures is becoming a key feature. This Article aims to make an assessment, a selection, and a description of the standardized instruments helping psychiatric diagnosis currently available in the field of child and adolescent's psychiatry. Medline and PsycINFO databases were exhaustively checked and the selection of the instruments was based on the review of four main criteria: i) compatibility with international diagnostic systems (DSM IV and/or ICD-10); ii) number of disorders explored; iii) peer reviewed Journals and iv) richness of psychometric data. After the analysis of the instruments described or mentioned in the literature, 2 structured interviews [the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC) and the Children's Interview for Psychiatric Syndromes (ChIPS)] and 4 diagnostic semi-structured interviews [the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (Kiddie-SADS), the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescent (DICA), the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment (CAPA) and the Interview Schedule for Children and Adolescents ISCA)] were retained according to the 3 first criteria. All can be administered by clinicians, and x out of 6 can also be administered by lay-interviewers. All include a child/adolescent version and a parent version. Two instruments evaluate the presence of DSM IV axe II disorders: The ISCA explores the criteria of the Antisocial Personality Disorder. The CAPA evaluates Borderline, Obsessional-compulsive, Histrionic and Schizotypic Personality Disorders. Regarding the psychometric quality criterion, the selection was much more difficult because of the lack of data and the weakness of the samples studied in reliability studies. Interrater reliability appeared to be good for the 6 instruments, with kappas ranging from 0.5 to 1. This is usual in such instruments. The test-retest reliability was found to vary from bad to excellent depending on the instruments, the \"informant\" status (child/adolescent or parent), and the disorder explored, kappas ranging from 0.32 to 1. The worst results concerned face-to-face reliability studies which showed weak concordances for the diagnoses, whatever the procedure implemented: Diagnostic interview vs. i) Another diagnostic interview, vs. ii) An expert diagnosis or vs. iii) Scales and questionnaires. Overall, the K-SADS-PL appeared to be the instrument that has the best test-retest reliability for Anxious Disorders and Affective Disorders (the value kappa showing good to excellent reliabilities). Several important methodological observations emerged from this review. Firstly, the metrological data corresponding to the diagnoses according to DSM IV or ICD-10 criteria's were lacking. The face validity was globally satisfactory, but the data concerning their face-to-face validities and their test-retest reliability, although better than in the former versions, were limited because they were tested on small sample. In fact, it appeared that the agreements depend on the informant, the sample studied, the various diagnostic categories and the instrument used. Since the studies carried out by Cohen et al., with now obsolete versions of the DISC and K-SADS, no other study establishing a comparison between two EDS have been conducted. Consequently, the clinicians must be very careful before comparing DSM or ICD diagnoses generated by different instruments. The second point was the length of the interviews that appeared sometimes longer than instruments used in adults, considering the fact that diagnostic procedure implies two independent interviews, one with the child/adolescent and one with the adult referent. The minimum duration was found to be 1 h 30 for the Chips in clinical setting, while it could reach 4 h or more for the DISC IV or the ISCA. The interviews had to be often carried out in several sessions, so the assessment became very difficult in easily tired and/or distractible subjects. The third point referred to the necessity to consider multiple data sources in young patients during the diagnostic procedure, and the weakness of the levels of agreement generally reported between sources. Empirically, it was observed that the investigator granted more weight to the report of the children than to the parent's one, when the clinical judgement was necessary to synthesize the data. On another level, studies showed a high agreement on the factual contents or on the specific events (ex: hospitalization), like on the obvious symptoms (ex: enuresis). The parents report more problems of behaviour, school and relational difficulties, whereas the children report more fear, anxiety, obsessions and compulsions, or delusional ideas. In other words, it appeared that children were better informants in describing their mental states (internalised disorders), and that adults would bring more reliable information in describing externalised disorders. Like McClellan and Werry, we think that further researches are needed to clarify if and when this is the case. The last major point concerned the problem of language. These instruments must be used in the maternal language of the interviewees and they were developed for most of them into English only. For example, there is only one instrument available into French (the Kiddie SADS). Nowadays, it remains difficult to conduct international studies in child and adolescent psychiatry and/or to compare data is this domain. To conclude, the use of the EDS and EDSS brings many benefits, in academic researches as well as in clinical practice, but a more systematic use is limited by a certain number of parameters. The instruments currently available in child and adolescent are far from being optimal in terms of quality and quantity. It seems necessary and useful to contribute to their development and their improvement. In particular, the following points should be considered: drastic reduction of the length of the interviews; simplification in the use of these instruments, during the interviews, but also in the treatment of the data collected during the final phase of diagnosis generation, the clinician having to carry out ceaseless returns to check the presence or not of each diagnostic criterion; reduction of the duration of the highly necessary training, which can be easily solved by the global simplification of the instruments; quantitative and qualitative improvements of psychometric properties, in particular in terms of sensitivity, specificity and face-to-face validity. Finally, it is highly necessary to continue to develop structured diagnostic interviews adapted to the assessment of child and adolescent psychiatric diagnoses keeping in mind simplicity, feasibility and reliability. Developing this kind of instruments is hard, expensive, and sometimes tiresome but it remains the inescapable stage to produce high quality data in the future."}, {"Title": "[Acute lithium intoxication.

The symptomatic overlap between different psychotic conditions and other emotional, behavioral, and developmental disorders has led to high rates of misdiagnosis, especially at time of onset. The clinical expression and progression of diagnosable disorders are affected by maturational processes. Thus, psychotic illnesses in pediatric patients may vary from adult presentations because of developmental factors. Establishing a specific diagnosis is difficult when the differential diagnosis comprises disorders that share common symptoms and are frequently comorbid. The clinical assessment depends as much on input from parents and teachers as from the patients themselves, and there may be conflict between these different perceptions.

The case of mesmerism in British India.", "Abstract": "This article is concerned with the development of early nineteenth-century Western medicine and psychiatry in relation to religion and magic during British colonial rule in India. The case of mesmerism is taken to illustrate that 'colonial medicine/psychiatry in India' itself was plural in nature, being made up of a variety of different, at times competing, strands. Religious connotations and references to spiritual enlightenment increasingly posed a peculiar problem to emerging Western science-based medicine in the nineteenth century. Mesmerism was met with as much hostility by an emerging Western medical orthodoxy as indigenous medical systems. The affiliation of mesmerism with Indian magical practices and religious customs contributed to its marginalization - despite or, rather, because of its popularity among members of the Indian nobility and middle classes, Indian patients and practitioners. The case of mesmerism also shows that awareness both of the domineering power of a gradually emerging medical 'imagined' mainstream and an analysis of the complex challenges faces by heterodoxy (as much as by orthodoxy) facilitate a more critical understanding of the development of colonial medicine and psychiatry in the East as well as, arguably, of medicine and psychiatry in Britain itself."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry in Genoa.", "Abstract": "The most important lines in the history of Genoese psychiatry are presented.

A complementary approach focuses on some of the cognitive processes involved in patients' re-evaluation of their anomalous experiences and of their specific misinterpretations: distancing, objectivity, perspective, and self-correction. The Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) was developed to evaluate patients' self-reflectiveness and their overconfidence in their interpretations of their experiences.

This situation dates back to the 1970s, in which strong aversive opinions toward ECT grew in the Netherlands, largely as a reaction to the malpractice of ECT in that time and influenced by social-cultural opinions toward psychiatry. Negative attitudes among professionals and lack of knowledge may contribute to the under use in depressed elderly patients.\nA postal questionnaire was sent to 152 psychiatrists who specialize in old age to assess their opinions and attitudes toward ECT.\nOnly a small minority thought ECT was a treatment of choice in a depressive disorder with psychotic features (4%), severe suicidal risk (2%), or physical exhaustion (5%). The majority of the psychiatrists had strongly reserved opinions in considering ECT as a treatment of first, second or third choice in depressed elderly patients, even in treatment-resistant depressive disorders.\nMany psychiatrists who specialize in old age in the Netherlands divert from the current guidelines and are reluctant toward using ECT as a treatment of choice in a number of specific, clinical situations. This might be a major contributing factor to the present and past underuse of ECT in depressed elderly patients in the Netherlands."}, {"Title": "Decision-making models in Japanese psychiatry: transitions from passive to active patterns.", "Abstract": "This study deconstructs the current dynamics of the physician-patient relationship in the treatment of minor mood disorders including depression in Japan. An in-depth qualitative investigation was conducted on psychiatrists employed at mental health clinics, university hospitals, and psychiatric hospitals. Triangulation was conducted concurrently using key informant interviews and periodic non-structured interviews with additional physicians and patients. Results revealed two patterns of omakase (entrusting) (Omakase Model) and an emerging pattern of patient participation in decision making (Participatory Model). The pattern traditionally denoted by the Omakase Model encompasses an active and passive entrusting model. The phenomenon of an emerging Participatory Model was uncovered whereby an in-depth analysis led to an understanding behind the associative physician-patient relationship, communication patterns, and a patient's level of awareness. It was found that while active participation in medical decision making is capable of raising the level of treatment efficacy, it is not only active participation in medical decision making, but also active participation in medical treatment that is valued in the physician-patient relationship. Ultimately, a patient actively participates in his or her medical treatment under either the active Omakase Model or Participatory Model, be it entrusting or participatory. Consequently, the active Omakase Model will continue to remain functional alongside the Participatory Model while the passive Omakase Model is likely to fade away in time."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry as a clinical science.

It has suggested that the philosophical and historical methods are not fundamentally different for they use the same tools to tackle different periods of the narratives of psychiatry. The history of the history of psychiatry has been analyzed in some detail and then something has been said on the conceptual approach as applied to the history of mental symptoms and diseases. The historical needs of the clinician have been emphasized. Conceptual analysis must be mindful of the fact that it is dealing with a complex mixture of narratives which directly and independently relate to the history of the words, concepts and behaviours involved in the construction of a symptom. In this sense, the history of descriptive psychopathology is seen as paying attention both to constructional elements (by accepting that the semantic content of the terms involved may markedly change from period to period, and is socially-dependent) and to the (often biological) invariants that confer continuity to particular forms of peculiar behaviour. In this latter respect, clinical historians entertain a form of naive realism of which (qua medics), they do not need to feel ashamed. Collaboration between professional historians and clinicians could render the conceptual history approach into a fine art. The ensuing body of knowledge not only would provide real historians with solid foundations for their macro-concepts, but also constitute a direct contribution to clinical understanding and patient care.

Cost effectiveness studies and guidelines based on such studies are often seen as impartial, neutral instruments which try to reduce the influence of non-scientific factors. However, such rationalising instruments often hide normative assumptions about the goals of treatment, the selection of treatments, the role of the patient, and the just distribution of scarce resources. These issues are dealt with in the context of increased control over clinical practice by third parties. In particular, health insurers have a great interest in economic evidence in clinical care settings in order to control access to and quality of (mental) health care. The authors conclude that guideline setting and cost effectiveness analysis may be seen as important instruments for making choices in health care, including mental health care, but that such an approach should always go hand in hand with a social and political debate about the goals of medicine and (mental) health care. This article is partly based on the results of a research project on the normative aspects of guideline setting in psychiatry and cardiology which was conducted under the guidance of the Royal Dutch Medical Association."}, {"Title": "The sniper attacks and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The three weeks of terror created by the snipers from October 2 to October 22 affected Maryland psychiatrists as it affected other Maryland citizens.

Clinical trials established alprazolam as efficacious for panic disorder, and the agent was widely prescribed for patients at MGH after its approval. Soon, however, clinical observation suggested a short duration of benefit for a given dose in some patients. In some cases, patients who missed a dose reported rebound worsening. In response to the apparent problematic pharmacokinetics of alprazolam, members of the MGH psychiatry department pursued investigation that ultimately established the antipanic efficacy of clonazepam as well as examined its effectiveness in the treatment of other disorders, such as bipolar disorder and social phobia.

Diseases discovered in the last 30-plus years, for example, Bartter syndrome and Gitelman syndrome, D-lactic acidosis, and bulimia nervosa, can be diagnosed according to characteristic acid-base findings. Accuracy in acid-base problem solving is a direct result of a reproducible, systematic approach to arterial pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, bicarbonate concentration, and electrolytes. The 'Rules of Five' is one tool that enables clinicians to determine the cause of simple and complex disorders, even triple acid-base disturbances, with consistency. In addition, other electrolyte abnormalities that accompany acid-base disorders, such as hypokalemia, can be incorporated into algorithms that complement the Rules and contribute to efficient problem solving in a wide variety of diseases. Recently urine electrolytes have also assisted clinicians in further characterizing select disturbances. Acid-base patterns, in many ways, can serve as a 'common diagnostic pathway' shared by all subspecialties in medicine. From infectious disease (eg, lactic acidemia with highly active antiviral therapy therapy) through endocrinology (eg, Conn's syndrome, high urine chloride alkalemia) to the interface between primary care and psychiatry (eg, bulimia nervosa with multiple potential acid-base disturbances), acid-base problem solving is the key to unlocking otherwise unrelated diagnoses.

The core symptoms of autism are abnormalities in social interaction, communication and behaviour. The involvement of neurotransmitters such as 5-HT has been suggested in neuropsychiatric disorders and particularly in autistic disorder. Increased platelet 5-HT levels were found in 40% of the autistic population, suggesting that hyperserotonaemia may be a pathologic factor in infantile autism. Therefore, it is of interest to assess the efficacy of cyproheptadine, a 5-HT2 antagonist in the treatment of autistic disorder. In this 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed the effects of cyproheptadine plus haloperidol in the treatment of autistic disorder.\nChildren between the ages 3 and 11 years (inclusive) with a DSM IV clinical diagnosis of autism and who were outpatients from a specialty clinic for children at Roozbeh Psychiatric Teaching Hospital were recruited. The children presented with a chief complaint of severely disruptive symptoms related to autistic disorder. Patients were randomly allocated to cyproheptadine + haloperidol (Group A) or haloperidol + placebo (Group B) for an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The dose of haloperidol and cyproheptadine was titrated up to 0.05 and 0.2 mg/kg/day respectively. Patients were assessed by a third-year resident of psychiatry at baseline and after 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of starting medication. The primary measure of the outcome was the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist-Community (ABC-C) and the secondary measure of the outcome was the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (relating to people and verbal communication). Side effects and extrapyramidal symptoms were systematically recorded throughout the study and were assessed using a checklist and the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale, administered by a resident of psychiatry during weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8.\nThe ABC-C and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale scores improved with cyproheptadine. The behaviour of the two treatments was not homogeneous across time (groups-by-time interaction, Greenhouse-Geisser correction; F = 7.30, d.f. = 1.68, P = 0.002; F = 8.21, d.f. = 1.19, P = 0.004 respectively).

No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of extrapyramidal symptoms (P = 0.23). The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side effects was not significant.\nThe results suggest that the combination of cyproheptadine with a conventional antipsychotic may be superior to conventional antipsychotic alone for children with autistic disorder.

Logistic regression detected three different psychopathological domains (delusional, alexithymic, and basic body symptoms) strongly associated with self-centrality. Among these the most influential independent variable was basic body symptoms. These results suggest that impaired lived body experience (i.e. protopathic body disattunement) is a psychopathologic condition concomitant with the emergence of autocentric polarization of experience (i.e. self-centrality)."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric complications in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the acute treatment phase: a series of 10 cases.", "Abstract": "In February 2003, Hong Kong was hit by a community-wide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

Academic psychiatrists pursuing comparative international studies on mental health, together with medical anthropologists conducting clinical ethnographies, contributed to its theoretical basis (Kleinman, 1987; Littlewood, 1990). What at first appeared to be a marginal specialty is no longer so. For example, the UK alone has witnessed a steady growth of the field, as evidenced by its mandatory inclusion in mental health training curricula, and the existence of several taught masters courses, academic positions in universities and three dedicated journals, as well as, more recently, lead papers in mainstream publications that have debated the cultural position of 'biology' itself (Timimi & Taylor, 2004). Additionally, with a proliferation of clinical jobs for 'ethnic minority' services in hospital trusts across the country, there is ample scope for employment. The overall evidence indicates that 'cultural psychiatry' in the UK is now a specialty in its own right."}, {"Title": "International psychiatry - an agenda for the way forward.", "Abstract": "A news release from the World Health Organization (2003) suggested that a mere 10% of global health research is devoted to diseases that account for 90% of the global disease burden.

Most of the authors are, as expected, psychiatrists living and working in Western Europe or North America. This is also, of course, acceptable and important.

Psychiatry is an evolving cultural product. Its diagnostic categories represent pathologies rooted in Western notions of self, identity, normality and abnormality (Gaines, 1991). Psychiatric practice in Egypt, on the other hand, is the product of two different and often incompatible world views, namely Western psychiatry and Egyptian concepts of self, identity, normality and abnormality. The task of the psychiatrist in Egypt is to negotiate symptoms and diagnoses in a way that is sensitive to the demands of these two competing cultural streams. Analysis of this process provides a unique view of the ways in which culture can have an impact on professional psychiatry in any society or ethnic context."}, {"Title": "Analysis of mental health publications from Arab countries in PubMed, 1987-2002.", "Abstract": "To perform geographical analysis of mental health publications produced in 22 Arab countries from 1987 to 2002 in PubMed, to compare the ratio of mental health to the total number of citations for each country as well as the percentage of each country`s mental health publication to the total mental health publications of the all Arab countries and to study the fields and types of mental health research publications in Arab countries during this period.\nA MEDLINE search was performed in July 2003 at the Faculty of Health Sciences, American University of Beirut to ascertain the total number of citations for each Arab country followed by another search in the MeSH database of MEDLINE for citations under the psychiatry and psychology category.

Although numerous reports on the risks of adverse hematological effects associated with psychotropic drugs have led to stringent monitoring requirements for some compounds, particularly neuroleptics, it is still difficult to estimate the true prevalence of such risks. Sixteen episodes of thrombocytopenia, 63 of neutropenia, 22 of agranulocytosis, 4 episodes of severe neutro- and thrombocytopenia, and 2 of pancytopenia were documented by the drug safety program in psychiatry AMSP (Arzneimittelsicherheit in der Psychiatrie) in a population of 122,562 patients between 1993 and 2000. All cases were related to the epidemiological data provided for this population and systematically analyzed as regards history of medication, co-medication, and the clinical course. Putative risk rates for the main groups of medications and a number of drugs could be estimated with this database. Most changes in the white blood cell counts, which were rated as probably or definitely drug-induced, were attributed to clozapine (0.18 % of patients exposed), carbamazepine (0.14 %) and perazine (0.09 %). In patients on newer atypical neuroleptics, we documented neutropenia assumed to be probably or definitely drug-related in five patients during treatment with olanzapine and in one case with risperidone. In all five olanzapine-related cases, the drugs were the sole cause of the adverse drug reactions. All surveyed patients who received clozapine showed no difference in age and gender distribution from those who developed hematological changes. Incidences of hematological changes for antidepressants were much lower (about 0.01 %).

Imputed drug classes for probable cases were antidepressants in 0.03 % and neuroleptics in 0.019 %, but other drugs were also involved. Within the group of antidepressants, the risk for a cardiac ADR depends much on the class: SSRIs were never imputed alone, but tricyclic antidepressants were imputed alone in 0.05 %. In the group of antipsychotics, the lowest rate of cardiac ADRs was found for the group of phenothiazines (0.003 %). Cardiovascular risk factors elevated the risk for a cardiac ADR from 0.04 % to 0.14 %. Age as an independent factor did not contribute substantially to the risk for a cardiac ADR.

Here we report on 53,042 of 122,562 patients treated with antidepressants who were monitored from 1993 to 2000 in 35 psychiatric hospitals in German-speaking countries. The overall incidence of severe ADRs of antidepressants was 1.4 % of exposed patients; when only ADRs rated as probable or definite were considered, a rate of 0.9 % in patients treated with antidepressants was observed. ADR rates were higher for TCAs (imputed in 1.0 % of patients overall, respectively in 0.6 % of patients when only ADs were imputed) and lower for MAO inhibitors and SSRIs (0.7 % for both, respectively 0.3 % and 0.4 %). Within the TCA group there was a difference among clomipramine (2.1 %, respectively 1.0 %), amitriptyline (1.0 %, respectively 0.6 %), and doxepin or trimipramine (both 0.6 %, respectively 0.3 %). With regard to single SSRI, similar rates were observed for paroxetine (0.8 %, respectively 0.5 %) and for citalopram (0.7 %, respectively 0.4 %). Of the new dual-acting antidepressants, venlafaxine ranged at 0.9 %, (respectively 0.5 %) and mirtazapine at 0.6 % (respectively 0.5 %). In particular, TCAs were associated with known risks, such as toxic delirium, grand mal seizures, and hepatic (i. e., increased liver enzymes), urologic (i. e., urinary retention), allergic (i. e., exanthema), or cardiovascular (i. e., mainly orthostatic collapse) reactions. In SSRI-treated patients (non-delirious) psychic and neurological ADRs were most prominent, followed by gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and endocrinological/electrolyte reactions, with agitation, hyponatremia (probably as part of the SIADH syndrome and associated with severe neurologic or psychiatric symptoms in 64 % of all cases), increased liver enzymes, nausea, and the serotonin syndrome as leading unwanted symptoms. Venlafaxine (in the immediate-release formulation) was associated with adverse CNS and somatic symptoms such as severe agitation, diarrhea, increased liver enzymes, hypertension, and hyponatremia. Mirtazapine was mostly connected with increased liver enzymes, cutaneous edema, and collapse, but with no case of significant hyponatremia.

A total of 60.7 % of patients experienced at least one adverse drug reaction (ADR) with probable or definite causality during their stay in the hospital; 37.1 % of patients exhibited ADRs that had some therapeutic impact on further treatment. ADRs that led to drug discontinuation were observed in 8.6 %. This rate ranged from 9.5 to 5.1 % for haloperidol and perazine, the most common neuroleptics at that time; sedating antidepressants (AD) rated lower than non-sedating (amitriptyline 5.1 %, clomipramine 10.4 %). Lithium salts, antiparkinson drugs, and benzodiazepines were associated with considerably lower rates of ADRs than neuroleptics or antidepressants. Severe ADRs occurred in 1.4 % of exposed patients (e. g., toxic delirium, grand mal seizures, malignant neuroleptic syndrome, or agranulocytosis). The AMUP data suggest that administration of psychotropic drugs in psychiatric hospitals at that time was a safe, but also inconvenient treatment for many patients due to a wide range of bothersome side effects that compromised patient compliance.

The association is consistent across both a case-control and family-based sample. We attempted to replicate their finding using a larger, independent family-based sample from the NIH Collaborative Programs of Excellence in Autism (CPEA) Network. In our data, allele transmissions to individuals with autism versus unaffected individuals are unbiased, both when alleles are classified by repeat length and when they are classified into long/short categories. Because of the apparent linkage of autism to chromosome 7q, particularly related to the development of language, we also evaluate the relationship between Reelin alleles and the age at which autism subjects use their first word or first phrase. Neither is significantly associated with Reelin alleles. Our results are not consistent with a major role for Reelin alleles in liability to autism."}, {"Title": "Candidate genes for nicotine dependence via linkage, epistasis, and bioinformatics.", "Abstract": "Many smoking-related phenotypes are substantially heritable.

Based on the principles of the glutamatergic hypothesis of schizophrenia, the amino acid glycine (GLY) and the antituberculosis drug D-cycloserine (DCS) have been assessed, during the last decade, as adjuvants to antipsychotic drugs. Observations stemming from these studies suggest that, in addition to improving schizophrenia symptoms, these compounds may also be beneficial against drug-induced dyskinesias. In order to investigate this hypothesis, GLY and DCS effects were studied using the putative TD analogue vacuous chewing movements (VCM) rat model. Following 24 weeks of treatment with haloperidol decanoate (0.38 mg/kg/4 weeks) rats (N=40) were randomized to receive one intraperitoneal injection with 1.6 g/kg GLY, 10 mg/kg (\"low dose\") DCS; 100 mg/kg (\"high dose\") DCS or saline (\"placebo\"), respectively. Behavior was videotaped at intervals during the experiment and all VCM, rearing, grooming and immobility episodes were analyzed and scored. A control group (N=9) received saline for 24 weeks. Haloperidol administration decreased motor activity and significantly induced VCM. High dose DCS significantly reduced VCM without affecting other motor parameters. GLY treatment resulted in significantly less VCM but also reduced rearing, grooming and mobility. In contrast, low dose DCS and placebo did not significantly affect any of these parameters. These findings indicate that the use of GLY and DCS results in attenuation of VCM in rats and may have an effect on TD in humans.

First, the therapeutic decision has to be rapid because of the unpredictability of its immediate course. This concerns often results in polypharmacy with adjunct treatments. However, the therapeutic choice has to be cautious since part of the treatment will be maintained for prophylaxis. According to recent guidelines, the use of monotherapy with mood stabilisers during acute manic states concerns only few patients with mostly hypomania to moderate mania. Up to date, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are considered as adjunct treatment in mania with psychotic symptoms or hostility. However, survey studies show that antipsychotics are widely used as adjunct treatments to mood stabilisers, indeed beyond the indications held by the guidelines. Our objective was to describe the clinical situations justifying the addition of an adjunct treatment during acute mania and to clear up from published data, the advantages and the inconveniences of combining antipsychotics and/or benzodiazepines with a mood stabilisers in order to define differentiated indications. Mania associated with either agitation, sleep disturbances or psychotic symptoms requires most of the time to combine mood stabiliser and respectively, sedative and/or anxiolytic, hypnotic or anti-psychotic treatments. Patients suffering from mania associated with other disorders need specific treatment adjustment and combination related to their medical condition. Adjunctive conventional antipsychotic remains widely used in first intention treatment. The conventional antipsychotic is often prescribed alone in the first weeks prior to the association with a mood stabiliser. Nevertheless there are controversies in the literature about their efficiency and their delay of action with regard to other treatments. When the conventional antipsychotic is a part of their initial treatment, manic patients remain taking them when discharged from hospital and are still taking them after 6 Months in a great percentage of the cases. The adverse events with conventional antipsychotic are numerous and severe enough in bipolar patients to restrict their use in first intention mainly to psychotic mania. Moreover, there are evidences for higher sensitivity to adverse effects of the conventional antipsychotics in manic patients. When agitation in acute mania requires an adjunct to mood stabiliser, the conventional antipsychotic treatment could be use for over-excitation without catatonic features and with particular care with the risk of akathisia. Long term effects of conventional antipsychotics, especially on depressive recurrences, should argue to stop them as soon as possible. Since the safety of adjunctive new antipsychotics with mood stabilisers seems until now acceptable, its indication should be limited to acute psychotic manias. Adjunctive benzodiazepine, should be evaluated in the various types of mania with specific concerns with comorbidity frequently met in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Benzodiazepines plus mood stabilisers may be the treatment of choice for the manias in which anxious state, catatonic symptoms or sleeplessness."}, {"Title": "[The practice of restraint in a psychiatric emergency unit].", "Abstract": "The practice of physical restraint is relatively frequent in medical emergency and geriatric units. Its use in psychiatry is controversial. Although distinct, it is often associated with seclusion, as a response to or prevention of agitated mentally ill patients'behavior. A detailed review of the literature shows the scarceness of work defining the exclusive use of restraint without seclusion. We report a naturalistic study over 6 Months, covering 76 cases having required restraint. The study of the international literature concerns nursing care, geriatric, child-adolescent psychiatric and adult psychiatric reviews. The restraint is a usual practice in general care like emergency, intensive care or geriatric units in order to prevent the patients from falling or to administrate certain care. Legal action has been reported as a consequence of lack of information or agreement of the family. The psychiatric use of restraint is conceived as an additional measure to seclusion, which is a controversial procedure from a therapeutic point of view as well as because of its long duration of application. The practice of restraint described in French literature, from Pinel (in to Daum\u00e9zon and from French hospital regulations to \"transparency forms\", seems to be more easily accepted for its short duration and its careful prescription in order to maintain relations with the patients, including agitated children. We made a 6 Months retrospective study in a Parisian psychiatric emergency unit receiving an average of 30 patients a day. The rate of restraint is 1.4%. The objective was to describe the main clinical, epidemiological and situational characteristics and to define quality criteria concerning restraint regarding to the existing standards. We had at our disposal a restraint protocol in order to avoid its prescription as a punishment or for the comfort or the convenience of an insufficient staff. The decision of the restraint is directly prescribed by a physician or decided in emergency by the nurses and then rapidly confirmed by medical prescription. In short, most restrained patients are male, the average age is 32 Years old, and the diagnoses associated with restraint in order of frequency are schizophrenia, personality disorders, acute psychotic episodes, manic episodes and toxic abuses. The main early-warning signs are aggressiveness, delusions, opposition, paranoiac thoughts and distrust. The average duration is 2 hours with continuous clinical supervision and a relational contact maintained. Our study confirms the notion of cumulate restraint days. Actually, 43% of the restraints happen on the same day as others do. The high rate on those days could be as Fischer hypothesized the result of instinctive, aggressive and sexual release of the staff, as well as the consequence of an increase in anxiety and agitation of the other patients. The legal framework is more the duty of assistance to a person in danger than constrained hospitalization, which is not systematically pronounced. No injury or somatic complication occurred during restraint. Neither complaint from the patient or his family nor sick leave of staff was recorded. The specific use of restraint can be compared to the existing standards for using the seclusion room. Among those standards only 1 of 23 criteria was not verified. The others was applicable or without object. The therapeutic use of restraint requires the development of specific quality standards, and the existing criteria concerning seclusion represent a necessary but insufficient answer. We emphasize the need to take into account the early warning signs, a response to the cumulative restraint days, as well as a satisfaction study on patients and the feasibility of such a study in an emergency service."}, {"Title": "The effect of ethnicity and gender on first-contact rates for schizophrenia-like psychosis in Bangladeshi, Black and White elders in Tower Hamlets, London.", "Abstract": "A recent study of very-late onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (SLP) in South London showed an increase in first contact rates amongst African- and Caribbean-born elders compared to British-born ones. This study investigates incident first contact rates in an area of East London with a high Bangladeshi population, to investigate if Bangladeshi-born elders also have an increased referral rate for SLP.\nRetrospective case note review of first contacts to the old age psychiatry service from 1997 to 2002 identifying cases of schizophrenia-like psychosis. In addition, a one-year review of first contacts for all diagnostic categories was completed. Gender, ethnicity and place of birth were established from the case notes.\nAmong the African- and Caribbean-born, but not the Bangladeshi-born, the odds ratio (OR) of being referred with SLP was significantly higher than for the British-born population. We observed a loss of the reported effect of female gender. For Whites the odds ratio for female gender and psychosis was 2.5 (1.0-6.1) and for non-Whites 0.8 (0.3-2.7) which was a trend away from the expected male to female ratio. In the one-year review there was a higher rate of referrals for organic disease in Bangladeshi men compared to Bangladeshi women and British-born men and women.\nBangladeshi elderly migrants do not have an increased rate of SLP compared to indigenous elders.

The frequencies with which combinations of drugs expected to interact via CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 were documented and compared between these two settings.\nAll 2089 drug prescriptions, of which 1237 (59%) were administered, were analyzed. One hundred and seventy-two patients (73%) on adult wards and 59 (68%) on functional elderly wards were prescribed at least one drug metabolized by and/or inhibiting CYP2D6, the difference being nonsignificant (95% confidence interval on the difference -6.3%, 16.4%). Anticipated interactions from 62/82 CYP2D6-related combinations prescribed on adult wards (27/100 patients) and 19/30 prescribed to elderly patients (22/100 patients) were judged to be clinically important or potentially clinically important. The proportion of patients on functional elderly wards prescribed at least one drug interacting with CYP3A4 (87%) was significantly greater than that for patients on adult wards (57%, P < 0.001). The frequency of interactions involving CYP3A4 was significantly greater on functional elderly than adult wards (43/100 vs 22/100 patients, P < 0.025, 95% confidence interval on the difference 4, 38/100).\nOur findings confirm extensive polypharmacy on general adult psychiatric and functional elderly psychiatric wards. A substantial proportion of patients were receiving combinations of drugs that interact with CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A4, many of which are known to produce clinically important interactions. Doctors practising in old age psychiatry should be aware that patients on functional elderly wards are at increased risk of clinically important CYP3A4 interactions. Psychiatrists should consider the pharmacokinetic implications of drugs prescribed for use 'as needed', because of the potential for unpredictable interactions."}, {"Title": "Experiences from psychiatric rotation for pre-registration house officers: contributions to subjective learning.", "Abstract": "The clinical experience and the subjective learning of pre-registration house officers who completed 4 months' psychiatric rotation are described.\nThe study was cross-sectional and based on self-report.

The relative concentrations of oxyhemoglobin [oxyHb] were measured with frontal and temporal probes every.1 sec during word fluency and unilateral finger tapping tasks, with two 24-channel NIRS machines.\nThe [oxyHb] increase patterns during the word fluency task varied among the three groups, although their task performances were similar: the depression group was characterized by a smaller [oxyHb] increase during the first half of the task period and the schizophrenic group by a small trough of [oxyHb] at the start of the task period and [oxyHb] re-increase in the posttask period. [OxyHb] increases during the finger-tapping task were rather larger in the patient groups than in the control group.\nThe characteristic time courses of [oxyHb] changes in the frontal lobe were elucidated for depression and schizophrenia.

Gen. Psychiatry 2002 (in press); Psychol. Med. 31 (2001) 459-467], very little is known about whether there are any differences in dysfunctional attitudes between unipolar and bipolar patients. Both the behavioural activation system theory [J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 67 (1994) 488-498; Major Theories of Personality Disorder, Guilford Press, New York, 1996; Psychol. Bull. 117 (1995) 434-449] and the cognitive model for bipolar affective disorder [Cognitive Therapy for Bipolar Disorder: A Therapist's Guide to Concepts, Methods and Practise, Wiley, New York, 1999] postulate high goal striving as a risk factor for bipolar disorder. However, the existing subscales in the dysfunctional attitude scale (DAS) were derived from patients and relatives of patients suffering from unipolar depression, patients with a mixed psychiatric diagnosis or normal controls. None of the existing subscales reflects high goal striving beliefs. Using a sample of bipolar patients may yield different factors.\nA total of 143 bipolar 1 patients filled in the short version of DAS 24. Principal component analysis was carried out to derive factors. The scores of these factors were compared with those of 109 unipolar patients to investigate if these factors distinguish bipolar patients from unipolar patients.\nThree factors were derived: factor 1 'Goal-attainment' accounted for 25.0% of the total variance. Factor 2 'Dependency' accounted for 11.0% of the total variance. Factor 3 'Achievement' accounted for 8.2% of the total variance. However, factor 1 appeared to consist of items that made a coherent theoretical construct. No significant differences were found when the validation sample was compared with 109 patients suffering from unipolar depression in any of the three factors. When subjects who were likely to be in a major depressive episode were excluded, the scores of bipolar patients (n=49) were significantly higher than euthymic unipolar patients (n=25) in factor 1 'Goal attainment'. Goal-attainment also correlated with the number of past hospitalisations due to manic episodes and to bipolar episodes as a whole.\nThe Goal-attainment subscale captures the risky attitudes described by the behavioural activation system theory and the cognitive model for bipolar affective disorder. It is postulated that these beliefs may interact with the illness and predispose bipolar patients to have a more severe course of the illness."}, {"Title": "[Creation of the first university chair in psychiatry: Johann Christian August Heinroth in Leipzig].", "Abstract": "Much research has been done on the work of the alleged \"psychicist\" Johann Christian August Heinroth (1773-1843).

Existing large-scale studies of polysubstance abusers have reported only minimal recovery of cognitive functioning with abstinence [Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 35 (1978) 1063]. The goal of this study is to test whether length of abstinence (1 day and 14 months) is related to cognitive ability in a large cross-sectional sample of men recovering from dependence on at least two drugs (N = 207). A series of Poisson and linear regressions were run to test whether length of abstinence is associated with neuropsychological performance while controlling for demographic variables, raw Vocabulary score, drug use, and dependency. The primary finding is that increasing length of abstinence was not statistically associated with superior neuropsychological ability. This suggests that the abuse of multiple substances potentially produces long-lasting neuropsychological impairment with minimal recovery of functioning over a 1-year period."}, {"Title": "Natural disaster and mental health in Asia.", "Abstract": "The purpose of the present article was to review the literature on disaster mental health in relation to natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and cyclones throughout Asia.

As an old soldier, I would like to give an account of some important milestones in my lifetime learning. The first factor that linked me to epilepsy was listening to a lecture delivered by Dr Yushi Uchimura on 'The pathogenesis of Ammon's horn sclerosis' at a conference of the Japanese Society of Neurology (now Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology) in 1928 when I was a 4th year medical student at Tokyo University. The following year, I started to study under Dr Uchimura at the Department of Psychiatry, Hokkaido University School of Medicine. Another factor that linked me to clinical care and research of epilepsy as a psychiatrist was my encounter with the two volumes of 'Selected Writing of John Hughlings Jackson' edited by J. Taylor. Jackson's greatest asset and contribution to modern epileptology include (i) the discovery of 'Jacksonian epilepsy', (ii) 'conceptual revolution of epilepsy' by recognizing transient mental disorders as seizures, (iii) modern definition of epilepsy by defining epileptic seizures as discharges in the gray matter, and (iv) discovery of 'new epilepsy' (now temporal lobe epilepsy). In 1940, I reported clinical courses indistinguishable from schizophrenia in epilepsy cases. Through my studies, I disputed the then prevailing interpretation of this condition as epilepsy complicating schizophrenia, and proved that these cases were in fact epileptic mental disorders caused by epilepsy. Many patients with epilepsy require medical care as well as rehabilitation and welfare support. We need to further promote the facilities for rehabilitation and employment in the community for persons with epilepsy, such as co-operatives and welfare worksites. The issues that epileptology and epilepsy face in the 21st century is to realize the goals of liberating epilepsy from social stigma and protecting all the citizen's rights for persons with epilepsy."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric treatment and research unit for adolescent intensive care: the first adolescent forensic psychiatric service in Finland.", "Abstract": "Finland does not have a history of providing forensic adolescent psychiatric units although the need for this kind of service has been established.

A total of 91 study subjects were recruited from child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinics. Clinical diagnoses were used as a gold standard for the examination of validity of K-SADS-PL-K. Consensual validity of threshold and sub-threshold diagnoses were good to excellent for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), fair for tic and oppositional defiant disorders, and poor to fair for anxiety and depressive disorders. Inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities were fair to excellent for ADHD and tic disorder. The significant correlations between the K-SADS-PL-K and Korean Child Behavior Checklist (K-CBCL) were found, which provided additional support for the concurrent validity of the K-SADS-PL-K. Sensitivities varied according to the diagnostic categories, but specificities remained high over all diagnoses, suggesting that the K-SADS-PL-K is a desirable confirmatory diagnostic tool. The results of this study suggest that the K-SADS-PL-K is an effective instrument for diagnosing major child psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, behavioral disorders and tic disorders in Korean children. Future studies will examine the validity and reliability of the K-SADS-PL-K in larger samples, including adolescents and community samples on a variety of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Sleep polygraphy in Angelman syndrome.", "Abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequent in Angelman syndrome (AS); however, beside the few studies which have investigated sleep disorders in AS by means of questionnaires, to our knowledge, no systematic polysomnographic recordings have been carried out in AS patients. The present study represents the first attempt to study sleep patterns of AS by polysomnography, to evaluate the influences of sleep on the paroxysmal electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns of AS and to assess the eventual age-related changes of sleep architecture and of sleep EEG abnormalities in children and adolescents with AS.\nFifteen children with AS (7 males and 8 females, mean age 7.2 years, range 3-16 years), attending the Sleep Center of the Department of Child Neurology and Psychiatry of the University of Rome 'La Sapienza' and the Sleep Research Centre of the Oasi Institute (IRCCS) of Troina were included and subdivided into two subgroups by age: subgroup 1, aged 3-5 years, and subgroup 2, aged 9-17 years. Two control groups of age-matched normal subjects were also included: one aged less than 8 years and another aged more than 8 years; additionally, two other groups of age-matched children with epilepsy and mental retardation of different origin, one aged less and one aged more than 9 years were taken into consideration. The statistical comparison between the sleep parameters obtained from the patients and those from the other groups was carried out by means of the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and the Mann-Whitney U test.\nThe most frequent EEG abnormality found in AS patients appeared to be the 2-3 c/s poorly defined spike/waves complexes. This pattern was influenced by sleep stages; the duration of the runs showed an increasing length with sleep deepening from sleep stage 1 to slow-wave sleep (SWS). Moreover, the 2-3 c/s bursts activity present in sleep stage 2 showed a slowing to 1-2 c/s during SWS. Regarding sleep architecture, in subjects with AS aged <8 year there was a significant reduction in sleep efficiency as compared to normal controls, while the percentage and duration of REM sleep was significantly lower and the percentage of SWS was significantly higher. REM sleep time was reduced in AS subjects aged >8 years than in normal controls. The comparison between AS groups and mental retardation with epilepsy groups did not show significant differences.\nSimilarly to other types of genetically determined mental retardation syndromes, also subjects with AS seems to show important abnormalities of their sleep polysomnographic patterns.\nThis is the first study which reports, in detail, these abnormalities and opens a new path for further insight into the knowledge of additional sleep-related disturbances which are reported in sleep questionnaires by the caregivers of AS subjects."}, {"Title": "Development of a computerized assessment of clinician adherence to a treatment guideline for patients with bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "The adoption of treatment guidelines for complex psychiatric illness is increasing. Treatment decisions in psychiatry depend on a number of variables, including severity of symptoms, past treatment history, patient preferences, medication tolerability, and clinical response. While patient outcomes may be improved by the use of treatment guidelines, there is no agreed upon standard by which to assess the degree to which clinician behavior corresponds to those recommendations. This report presents a method to assess clinician adherence to the complex multidimensional treatment guideline for bipolar disorder utilized in the Texas Medication Algorithm Project. The steps involved in the development of this system are presented, including the reliance on standardized documentation, defining core variables of interest, selecting criteria for operationalization of those variables, and computerization of the assessment of adherence. The computerized assessment represents an improvement over other assessment methods, which have relied on laborious and costly chart reviews to extract clinical information and to analyze provider behavior. However, it is limited by the specificity of decisions that guided the adherence scoring process. Preliminary findings using this system with 2035 clinical visits conducted for the bipolar disorder module of TMAP Phase 3 are presented. These data indicate that this system of guideline adherence monitoring is feasible."}, {"Title": "General psychiatry residents' perceptions of specialized training in the field of mental retardation.", "Abstract": "This study examined the perceptions of general psychiatry residents about the utility of specialized training that they received on an inpatient unit for patients with mental retardation and co-occurring psychiatric disorders.

It serves as the main regulating hormone of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, which is activated within seconds after exposure to acute stress. Furthermore, it acts as a neurotransmitter in numerous other brain regions. Globally, CRH leads to a number of metabolic, neuroendocrine and autonomic adaptations, which are vitally important for an adequate reaction to acute stress, but can lead to pathological somatic and psychological effects in chronic stress situations. The adequate functioning of CRH is a delicate equilibrium, which can be permanently disturbed by early experiences of physical or sexual abuse, leading to psychopathology in adulthood. This review discusses the physiological functions of CRH as the stress response hormone. Subsequently, the emerging data on the disruptive effects of early trauma on the CRH system are summarized. The third part is devoted to CRH and HPA axis abnormalities in major depression and other psychiatric disorders. This rapidly accumulating evidence will change our understanding of psychopathology, and might challenge the established classification of psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Developing the BALANCE trail--the role of the pilot study and start-up phase.", "Abstract": "The initial design of the BALANCE (Bipolar Affective disorder: Lithium / ANtiConvulsant Comparative Evaluation) Trial of maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder was based on the experience of previous trials in bipolar disorder and psychiatry and on the methods developed for large randomized trials in other areas of medicine. This report describes the adaptations to the initial design and trial procedures following the initial phases of the study. The rationale for the trial and full protocol have been published elsewhere.\nA pilot study and start-up phase were used to check the tolerability of the interventions, refine the trial design and develop trial procedures that are acceptable to both clinicians and patients.\nChanges to the procedures included: the dropping of masking of allocated treatment from clinicians and participants; introduction of the use of postal delivery to supply medication; and dispensing with the proposed schedule of regular follow up appointments. In addition, support was made available to participating psychiatrists who often had limited experience of participating in randomized trials.\nPilot studies and start-up phases are essential to refine clinical trial design and allow development of procedures that are both methodologically rigorous and flexible and robust enough to promote recruitment and follow up.

The current study was undertaken to map the course of the disorder and the prevailing prescribing practice in early-onset bipolar disorder at a child and adolescent psychiatry center in India. A chart review of 139 children and adolescents (<16 years) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder-mania was performed and the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, episode characteristics, and treatment and follow-up details were collected and the data analyzed. The index episode remitted in all 133 (96%) subjects for whom the information was available. One hundred twenty-five (90%) subjects received thymoleptics for the index episode, of which lithium was used in 85%. Valproate was the next most commonly used thymoleptic (18%). Eighteen (13%) subjects received combination thymoleptics. Sixty-eight percent received neuroleptics either alone or as adjuncts in the acute phase. During the follow-up period, which ranged from 3 to 56 months (mean +/- SD, 15 +/- 14), 35% of subjects relapsed, 89% within the first 2 years. Twenty-eight percent of subjects relapsed despite being on apparently adequate doses of lithium. The limitations of the study are that it is retrospective in nature, and that structured diagnostic tools and rating scales were not used. We conclude that lithium is the most commonly used thymoleptic in early-onset bipolar disorder. Lithium alone or in combination with neuroleptics appears to have good efficacy in the acute phase of the disorder. The majority of relapses occurred in the first 2 years and the efficacy of currently used thymoleptics in prophylaxis is uncertain."}, {"Title": "The 5-HT2C receptor as a target for mood disorders.", "Abstract": "The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine<inf>2C</inf> [5-HT<inf>2C</inf>]) receptor is one of the 5-HT receptors with a G-protein-coupled intracellular signalling pathway. A large number of compounds showing antidepressive, antipsychotic and anxiolytic properties, and affecting sleep patterns, feeding behaviour and neuroendocrine functions, target this subtype of receptor. The potential use of 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptor ligands in psychiatry has been suggested as a result of a number of observations from animal and in vitro experiments. The results of studies performed suggest that some of the therapeutic effects of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be mediated, at least in part, by the 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptor. The long-term downregulation of 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptors is associated with their interaction with some SSRIs and may lead to disinhibition of the mesolimbic dopamine system, which may be partly responsible for their antidepressant action. Nevertheless, current evidence does not allow complete definition of 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptor functions and properties. Concerning genetics, there are no unequivocal results for the involvement of polymorphisms of the 5-HT<inf>2C</inf> receptor, and no studies on their association with an antidepressant response have ever been performed.

Our aim was to find a link between overt aggressive and autoaggressive behaviour, which could be readily observed.\nWe investigated the frequency, type and intensity of aggressive, suicidal and self-injurious behaviour exhibited by 521 successively admitted psychiatric patients at the time of admission with the help of a standardised instrument (Social Dysfunction and Aggression Scale). The Social Dysfunction and Aggression Scale enables the investigation of 9 different types of overt aggressive behaviour and 2 different types of autoaggressive behaviour (suicidal vs. self-injurious behaviour). After calculating correlations between single variables, we attempted to estimate the predictive value of the different types of aggressive behaviour for suicidal and self-injurious behaviour by using ordinal regression models. In addition, the categorical information of our data was evaluated by loglinear analyses.\nOur study showed that all degrees of aggressiveness (low, moderate, high), which are exhibited in different types of aggressive behaviour, were linked to an increased risk of self-injurious behaviour. No correlation was found, however, between overt aggressive behaviour and suicidal behaviour. Only in the subgroup of depressive disorders did we establish that the risk of aggressive behaviour was decreased and the risk of suicidal behaviour was increased at the time of admission.\nThe strong relationship between aggressive behaviour and self-injurious behaviour has previously been described in specific diagnostic subgroups, but not yet in a heterogeneous population of psychiatric in-patients from a defined catchment area. We, therefore, conclude that the link between aggressive and self-injurious behaviour could be a general one. Exhibiting aggressive behaviour and self-injurious behaviour within a short time span may be the result of an increased or disinhibited aggressive potential, which is independent of a specific diagnosis. As such, it possibly represents the general consequence of a highly altered state of mind and does not seem to be linked to a specific diagnostic subgroup. In psychiatric emergency situations, the previously described close relationship between aggressive and self-injurious behaviour should be taken into account."}, {"Title": "Childhood sexual abuse.

A clinical epidemiological cross-sectional study in patients with psychiatric disorders].", "Abstract": "To study the prevalence of pain and risk factors for pain in psychiatric patients in a psychiatric hospital.\nUsing a questionnaire we investigated in a cross-sectional study the prevalence of pain, duration of pain, impairment and unfitness for work due to pain in 106 patients primarily diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder in the field of general adult psychiatry. Potential risk factors were explored.\nThe point prevalence of pain was about 50%, the 6-month prevalence 75.5% and the 12-month prevalence 76.5%. The patients' most frequent complaints were low back pain, headache and shoulder and neck pain. Patients with affective disorders most frequently had pain complaints, followed by those with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and those with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizotypic and delusional disorders. Almost 10% of all patients reported pain continuing at least 3 months in the past year. Impairment and unfitness for work were related to specific psychiatric diagnosis. Statistically significant risk factors for pain were depression (OR=6.05) and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals (OR=3.609).\nWe found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines."}, {"Title": "Expert and trainee determinations of rhetorical relevance in referral and consultation letters.", "Abstract": "Referral and consultation letters ferry patients among providers, negotiating co-operative care. Our study examined how \"relevance\" is signalled and decoded in these letters, from the perspective of both experts and trainees in three clinical specialties.\n104 letters were collected from 16 physicians representing family medicine, psychiatry and surgery. Interviews were conducted with 14 of these physicians and 13 residents from the three specialties. All documents and transcripts were analysed for emergent themes.\nSix rhetorical factors influenced expert physicians' decisions about what material is relevant: educational, professional, audience, system-institutional, medical-legal, and evaluative. Each specialty placed different emphasis on these factors. Trainees reported having no instruction regarding how to construct rhetorically relevant letters, and they demonstrated awareness of only three of the factors identified by experts--professional, audience and evaluative. Experts and trainees differed in their understanding and application of these three factors.\nThis research demonstrates that six rhetorical factors influence relevance decisions in letter writing, and that experts address these factors in tacit, dynamic and discipline-specific ways. Trainees share with experts an appreciation of the rhetorical functions of referral and consultation letters, but lack a comprehensive understanding of the influential factors and do not receive instruction in them. These findings provide a framework for instruction in this domain to equip novices to meet the expectations of their professional audiences successfully."}, {"Title": "Exclusion criteria used in antidepressant efficacy trials: consistency across studies and representativeness of samples included.", "Abstract": "The inclusion and exclusion criteria used to select subjects for participation in antidepressant efficacy trials (AETs) vary from study to study. It is unknown how much impact different sets of exclusion criteria have on the representativeness of subjects treated in AETs. In the present study, we applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria used in 39 recently published AETs to patients evaluated in routine clinical practice to evaluate the range and extent of the representativeness of samples treated in AETs. Nearly 600 patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar depression underwent a thorough diagnostic evaluation. Inclusion and exclusion criteria used in AETs were applied to determine how many patients from our sample would have qualified for each AET had they applied. Approximately one sixth of the 596 depressed patients would have been excluded from an efficacy trial because they had a bipolar or psychotic subtype of depression. In the remaining 503 outpatients with nonpsychotic, unipolar MDD, the rates of exclusion ranged from 0% to 95.0% (mean=65.8%). Thus, the findings suggest that there is much variability in the generalizability of AETs, although, in general, subjects treated in AETs represent only a minority of patients treated for MDD in a community-based psychiatry outpatient practice."}, {"Title": "Portable computing in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Personal digital assistants (PDAs) or handheld computers have become more popular in the practice of medicine.

The literature shows that the general public is using the Internet to obtain information and, to a lesser extent, to communicate with health care professionals. In terms of health outcomes, the effectiveness of patient on-line access to information is still uncertain, and further research is necessary. Although physicians have embraced on-line journals, further work is required before they embrace on-line CME.

Eighty-five PD patients were submitted to both a hyperventilation challenge test and a breath-holding test. They were asked to hyperventilate (30 breaths/min) for 4 min and a week later to hold their breath for as long as possible, four times with a 2-min interval. Anxiety scales were applied before and after the tests. We selected the patients who responded with a panic attack to just one of the tests, i.e., those who had a panic attack after hyperventilating (HPA, N = 24, 16 females, 8 males, mean age +/- SD = 38.5 +/- 12.7 years) and those who had a panic attack after breath holding (BHPA, N = 20, 11 females, 9 males, mean age +/- SD = 42.1 +/- 10.6 years). Both groups had similar (chi(2) = 1.28, d.f. = 1, P = 0.672) respiratory symptoms (fear of dying, chest/pain discomfort, shortness of breath, paresthesias, and feelings of choking) during a panic attack. The criteria of Briggs et al. [British Journal of Psychiatry, 1993; 163: 201-209] for respiratory PD subtype were fulfilled by 18 (75.0%) HPA patients and by 14 (70.0%) BHPA patients. The HPA group had a later onset of the disease compared to BHPA patients (37.9 +/- 11.0 vs 21.3 +/- 12.9 years old, Mann-Whitney, P < 0.001), and had a higher family prevalence of PD (70.8 vs 25.0%, chi(2) = 19.65, d.f. = 1, P = 0.041).

To assess the type and scope of services delivered in the PES setting, the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry sponsored an Expert Consensus Panel Survey of these services in 1999. The questionnaire was mailed to medical directors of PES facilities with 91% (n = 51) responding. More than 90% of the respondents were teaching sites. Restraints were reportedly used in a mean of 8.5% of presentations for a mean of 3.3 h per episode. Restraint utilization correlated with the percentage of psychotic patients treated, but not with a wide variety of other patient and service variables. Involuntary medications were used in 16% of cases, though in oral form in 29% of those cases. A large majority (94%) endorsed mild sedation permitting further assessment as the appropriate endpoint and rejected sleep or heavy sedation as an endpoint (82%). Benzodiazepines received the strongest endorsements and 82% indicated it would be appropriate to administer a benzodiazepine alone for agitation first and initiate antipsychotic treatment subsequently if appropriate. When there is no history of prior antipsychotic exposure, 60% favored a benzodiazepine alone. However, given a history of previous antipsychotic treatment, only 8% endorsed this strategy. Most respondents (78%) preferred to use oral medication for treating behavioral emergencies, whenever possible but 70.3% reported regular use of an IM combination of a benzodiazepine and high-potency typical neuroleptic when necessary. In addition to managing emergencies, 82% of services initiated standing medications for patients being admitted to hospital settings and 70% initiated regular medication treatments for patients being released to the community. Of patients started on oral antipsychotics, 42% received an atypical antipsychotic.

Does the mutation Leu309Met in the WKL1 gene, encoding a putative membrane protein, non-selective cation channel, have any effect on the channel activity? Is the WKL1 gene, which is expressed exclusively in brain, expressed differently in SCZ brains compared to controls? These questions were answered by screening the Leu309Met mutation in 117 Israeli Jewish patients with SCZ (55 Ashkenazi and 62 non-Ashkenazi Jews) and 176 matched controls. In search of differences in the level of WKL1 gene expression, postmortem dorsalateral prefrontal cortex of 16 schizophrenic patients and 15 controls was checked.

Psychoses complicate about one in 1000 deliveries. The most common is related to manic depression, in which neuroleptic drugs should be used with caution. Post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessions of child harm, and a range of anxiety disorders all require specific psychological treatments. Postpartum depression necessitates thorough exploration. Cessation of breastfeeding is not necessary, because most antidepressant drugs seem not to affect the infant.

It is hoped that the application of such technologies will result in the identification of novel targets for the treatment of diseases such as depression and to gain a better understanding of the molecular pathophysiological mechanisms that are regulated by current clinically effective antidepressant medications. The advent of these tools has resulted in the need to adopt, refine and develop mouse-specific models for analyses of depression-like behavior or behavioral patterns modulated by antidepressants. In this review, we will focus on the utility of current models (eg forced swim test, tail suspension test, olfactory bulbectomy, learned helplessness, chronic mild stress, drug-withdrawal-induced anhedonia) and research strategies aimed at investigating novel targets relevant to depression in the mouse. We will focus on key questions that are considered relevant for examining the utility of such models. Further, we describe other avenues of research that may give clues as to whether indeed a genetically modified animal has alterations relevant to clinical depression. We suggest that it is prudent and most appropriate to use convergent tests that draw on different antidepressant-related endophenotypes, and complimentary physiological analyses in order to provide a program of information concerning whether a given phenotype is functionally relevant to depression-related pathology."}, {"Title": "Visual scanpath dysfunction in first-degree relatives of schizophrenia probands: evidence for a vulnerability marker?", "Abstract": "Previous research demonstrates that people with schizophrenia have abnormally 'restricted' visual scanpaths to face and facial expression stimuli, which appear to be diagnostically specific to schizophrenia [Schizophr.

We recorded visual scanpaths for 65 schizophrenia subjects, 37 biological first-degree relatives and 61 nonrelated 'healthy' control subjects in two experiments: 'face recognition' and 'facial affect recognition'. Concurrent behavioral tasks were face matching and expression matching, each under two multiple-choice conditions (seven or three options). As predicted, first-degree relatives generally showed an attenuated form of the markedly 'restricted' scanpaths of schizophrenia subjects across all face stimuli. The notable exception to this pattern was the relatives' extreme avoidance of facial features (compared to both schizophrenia and healthy control groups). Our results offer the first evidence that some components of visual scanpath dysfunction may represent a trait marker in the familial transmission of schizophrenia, but that first-degree relatives may have additional disturbances in social cognition associated with the perception of facial features."}, {"Title": "Evidence-based medicine and geriatric psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The vast amount of clinical information available today and the difficulties that clinicians have in applying this information have given rise to interest in evidence-based medicine.

Depression is the most common mental disorder related to suicidal behavior. The present study aimed at investigating the relationship between the symptomatology related to death, dying, and suicide and neurobiological factors in depressed patients. Fifty patients aged 21-60 years suffering from major depression were investigated. Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry version 2.0 and the International Personality Disorder Examination were used to assist the clinical diagnosis. The psychometric assessment included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the 1965 and 1971 Newcastle Depression Diagnostic Scales, the Diagnostic Melancholia Scale, the General Assessment of Functioning Scale, and the Personality Deviance Scale. Psychophysiological methods included electro-oculogram, flash electroretinogram under photopic and scotopic conditions, and pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials. Biological markers included the 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test, the 30-mg dexfenfluramine challenge test, and brain (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT. Statistical analysis included one-, two-, and three-way Manova and Mancova and the Scheff\u00e9 test as post hoc test. Patients without thoughts of death had higher self-confidence levels and less overdependency on others and intropunitiveness. The suicidal patients had a significantly prolonged pattern-reversal visual evoked potential latency in comparison with the other patients. The findings of this were related to the status of the patient at the time of the interview but not to his/her history. They also provide neurobiological data to support the need for a combined presence of self-directed aggression and a higher arousal level or disinhibition of self-directed aggressive thoughts in order for a patient to become suicidal.

The authors examined the impact of past exposure to the Nazi Holocaust on the development of suicidal ideation in a sample of depressed older adults.\nAuthors conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study. The study sample comprised data on 530 consecutive eligible first admissions of Jewish patients who were referred and admitted to a geriatric psychiatry day hospital program between September 1986 and December 2000.\nMultiple logistic-regression analyses, controlling for social support, history of suicide attempts, and other negative life events, showed that severity of depression and exposure to the Holocaust were independently associated with suicidal ideation. Those not showing suicidal ideation were slightly more likely to have reported having a confidant.\nThis is the first empirical study to demonstrate an increased likelihood for suicidal ideation in survivors of the Nazi Holocaust. The chronic stress produced by these traumatic events may have predisposed survivors to cope ineffectively as they age, thus resulting in suicidal ideation.

In the context of recent findings that the performance of individuals with HFA was superior to typically developing individuals in several non-social cognitive operations, it was expected that the HFA group would outperform a typically developing comparison group matched on full-scale IQ. Results showed that individuals with autism performed all spatial tasks at a level at least equivalent to the typically developing comparison group. No differences between groups were found in route and survey tasks. Superior performance for individuals with HFA was found in tasks involving maps, in the form of superior accuracy in graphic cued recall of a path, and shorter learning times in a map learning task. We propose that a superior ability to detect [Human Perception and Performance 27 (3) (2001) 719], match [Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry 34 (1993) 1351] and reproduce [Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry 40 (5) (1999) 743] simple visual elements yields superior performance in tasks relying on the detection and graphic reproduction of the visual elements composing a map. Enhanced discrimination, detection, and memory for visually simple patterns in autism may account for the superior performance of persons with autism on visuo-spatial tasks that heavily involve pattern recognition, either in the form of recognizing and memorizing landmarks or in detecting the similarity between map and landscape features.

In line with a recent hypothesis, using the experience of AED treatment in psychiatry, we examined whether mood effects are related to the known anticonvulsant mechanisms of action of the AEDs. Specifically we examined whether AEDs, acting through potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmitter release, have \"sedating\" effects on mood, whereas AEDs that act through the reduction of excitatory glutamate neurotransmitter release have \"activating\" effects on mood. The results of this review yield evidence that there are relationships between the known anticonvulsant mechanisms of action of the AEDs and mood effects. Mood effects occur especially when the drugs have a sustained effect on neuronal mechanisms, in particular when the inhibitory or excitatory neurotransmitter release is altered. Drugs with \"use-dependent\" impact on sodium or calcium channels probably have a more transient impact and do not lead to interictal stable mood effects. Drugs with multiple mechanisms of action seem to combine a favorable efficacy profile with an increased risk of severe mood problems. The quality of the evidence, however, is not conclusive and there are many paradoxical results. One reason for this lack of \"fit\" may be the use in this review of a simplified classification, based only on the predominant mechanism of action to classify a drug. Only a limited number of AEDs (ethosuximide, tiagabine) are characterized by a single anticonvulsant mechanism of action. Probably more detailed coupling of mechanisms of action (e.g., inspecting the type and route of impact on GABA release) and mood effects may give less confusing results. The use of magnetic resonance imaging techniques such as spectroscopy may provide interesting results."}, {"Title": "Sleep and sleep disorders in Don Quixote.", "Abstract": "In Don Quijote de la Mancha, Miguel de Cervantes presents Don Quixote as an amazing character of the 17th century who suffers from delusions and illusions, believing himself to be a medieval knight errant. Besides this neuropsychiatric condition, Cervantes included masterful descriptions of several sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep deprivation, disruptive loud snoring and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. In addition, he described the occurrence of physiological, vivid dreams and habitual, post-prandial sleepiness--the siesta. Cervantes' concept of sleep as a passive state where all cerebral activities are almost absent is in conflict with his description of abnormal behaviours during sleep and vivid, fantastic dreams. His concept of sleep was shared by his contemporary, Shakespeare, and could have been influenced by the reading of the classical Spanish book of psychiatry Examen de Ingenios (1575)."}, {"Title": "The perception of aggression by nurses: psychometric scale testing and derivation of a short instrument.", "Abstract": "Patient aggression is a serious problem in psychiatric nursing. Nurses' attitudes towards aggression have been identified as mediating the choice of nursing interventions. To date, investigations are lacking which elucidate the stability of one of the few scales for measuring the attitude of aggression. This study aimed to investigate the test-retest stability of the Perception of Aggression Scale and to derive a shortened version. In order to test the reliability of the Perception of Aggression Scale items, three groups of psychiatric nurses were requested to fill in the Perception of Aggression Scale twice (30 student nurses after 4 days, 32 qualified nurses after 14 days and 36 qualified nurses after 70 days). We derived the shortened version from an independent data set obtained from 729 psychiatry nurses using principal component analysis, aiming to maximize parsimony and Cronbach's alpha. Amongst competing short versions, we selected those with the highest reliability at 70 or 14 day retest. A scale using 12 of the original 32 items was derived yielding alphas of r = 0.69 and r = 0.67 for the two POAS factors with retest reliabilities of r = 0.76 and r = 0.77. The shortened scale offers a practical and viable alternative to the longer version."}, {"Title": "'Caught in the middle'? Mental nurse training in England 1919-51.", "Abstract": "The early history of mental health nurse training is one that has only been partially researched. While some writers have discussed the content and impact of training on the development of mental health nursing, little has been written on the professional and institutional factors that influenced this development. The medical profession, psychiatry, was to play an important role in the development of training and regulation of nursing staff in the large Victorian asylums and was an important influence on the knowledge base of mental health nursing. Their professional organization, the Medico-Psychological Association (the Royal Medico-Psychological Association after 1926 when they acquired a royal prefix) produced the first textbook for asylum nurses in 1885 and established a national training scheme for them 4 years later. However, in 1919 the Nurses Registration Act established the General Nursing Council for England and Wales and this body was given statutory responsibility for the training and registration of nurses, including 'mental' nurses. They were soon to be in conflict with the Medico-Psychological Association. The two organizations continued to run their own rival training schemes for mental health nurses for over 30 years, the Royal Medico-Psychological Association finally relinquishing their role in 1951. The Royal Medico-Psychological Association scheme proved far more popular than the General Nursing Councils, with significantly more nurses participating in it. This paper discusses these organizational influences on the development of 'mental nurse' training and discusses the possible impact that they have had on the knowledge base of mental health nursing."}, {"Title": "Religious and spiritual assessment of the child and adolescent.", "Abstract": "Assessment in child and adolescent psychiatry is a complex process that involves developmental, environmental, and experiential perspectives.

Relative to PhD applicants, fewer grant proposals were being made by physicians (paired t16 = 7.08, p < 0.001) and, in consequence, fewer proposals were funded. The proportion of proposals funded was similar for MD and PhD applicants (paired t16 = 0.27, p = 0.79).

The diagnosis was established if the hallucinations were well documented as being anxiety-related, not auditory, and with no evidence of underlying organic etiology. All cases were initially screened in the emergency department. Demographic information included age, gender, duration, and description of symptoms, stressors, family psychiatric history, and outpatient treatment.\nTen children with this disorder were encountered. VTPH can be differentiated from other causes of hallucinations in that the children are preschool to young school age; their hallucinations are tactile and visual, presenting at night; and symptoms are anxiety-based but short-lived. When toxins, drug reactions, central nervous system, and febrile etiologies are ruled out, timely consultation with the psychiatry team can eliminate costly and time-consuming procedures and avoid further emotional distress for the child and family.\nVTPH is a more commonly occurring disorder than previously reported in the pediatric emergency medicine literature.

People with mental illness are at great risk of suicide, but indirect evidence suggests that the treatment of psychiatric disorders may prevent suicide. The aim of our study was to compare the risk of suicide in the population of psychiatric patients with that of the general population in Friuli Venezia-Giulia (FVG). METHOD We analyzed the suicide rates, based on the official statistical database, relating to the resident population in FVG during the years 1998-1999. The sucide rates (per 100\u2008000 subjects) were standardised by sex and age. The characteristics of suicidal behaviour in subjects who had been in contact with (Community Mental Health Centres) CMHC (n=65) were compared with that of suicidal subjects not in contact (n=237). RESULTS There was an increase in the suicide phenomenon in the elderly population in FVG over the tested period. The rates were three times higher in males than in females. The rates of patients in contact with CMHC in 1998 and in 1999 were, respectively, 14 and 20 times higher than that of the general population. Most suicidal schizophrenics and 37% of the depressed patients have been previously hospitalised. CONCLUSION The population of north-eastern Italy is at high risk of suicide compared to other regions. The mortality ratio of psychiatric subjects who commit suicide in our sample is elevated. Since Italian community-oriented services rely less on hospitalisation than in other countries, the fact that about 50% of suicidal psychiatric patients have been previously admitted in a psychiatric ward may indicate that previous hospitalisation is a hierarchic factor related to suicide."}, {"Title": "Medication algorithm for mood disorders: Present status and future direction in Japan.", "Abstract": "Medication algorithms have been used extensively in treating psychiatric patients, while geographic variations among these reflect the local history of the practice of psychiatry in each region. Here we review algorithms used for mood disorders in Japan in terms of their utility, problems, and possible future development. The first Japanese algorithm for mood disorders was completed in 1997 by the Japanese Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project (JPAP). Development of the JPAP algorithm was evidence-based, giving major but not exclusive weight to clinical trial outcomes. Unlike others, the JPAP algorithm suggests possible addition of a benzodiazepine to first-line antidepressant treatment for major depression. When the first-choice antidepressant fails, the algorithm recommends monotherapy with another antidepressant over \"add-on\" therapy. Clinical problems with the JPAP algorithm include lack of guidance concerning how to change from one drug to another. Psychiatry in Japan provides less formal structure for post-graduate education and undertakes less communication with the general public than in many countries.

Using a retrospective approach, a single investigator reviewed the medical records of individuals diagnosed with major depression or dysthymia (those with both disorders were excluded from analysis) in an adult, university-based, outpatient psychiatry clinic. Records were examined for demographic information, Axis I and II diagnoses, number and type of psychotropic medications, and number of psychotherapy sessions. There were no demographic differences between groups. Compared to those with major depression, individuals with dysthymia had a similar number of Axis I diagnoses, but were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with a personality disorder. Those with major depression were prescribed a significantly greater number of psychotropic medications, and all seven patients who received antipsychotics were diagnosed with major depression. Finally, there were no between-group differences in the number of psychotherapy sessions. These data indicate that, compared with major depression, dysthymia may have significantly greater Axis II, but not Axis I, psychiatric comorbidity. The implications of greater psychotropic medication prescription among the subsample with major depression, and similar psychotherapy utilization between groups, is discussed.

They do not take into account the multiple phenotypes of depression and often do not include patients with \"real-life\" clinical depression. Psychiatry is called an evidence-based specialty, and this is supported by the wealth of evidence provided by the antidepressant drug trials. However, if the evidence demonstrated by these trials is not accurate, then psychiatry may fail to provide satisfactory treatment for patients with depression. Trial data commonly show the effect of antidepressant treatment to be indistinguishable from placebo. On first examination it could be said that antidepressant drugs act mainly as placebos, or, even worse, that antidepressant drugs are no better than placebos in effect. However, this view is at odds with the observations of clinicians in everyday practice, and the impact of this perception is worrying, with the pharmaceutical companies, patients and practitioners all being adversely affected. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) provide limited data about the true effectiveness of an antidepressant. However, such RCTs are required by regulatory authorities for drug approval. Antidepressant effects in \"real-life\" depression need further investigation. When efficacy data for drug and non-drug treatments for major depression are compared, there are very few differences. This lack of differentiation across treatments allows every therapy to be perceived as efficacious, but also non-specific. This leads to patients being fitted to their therapist's preferred treatment, and not vice versa. This \"all roads lead to rome\" model is contrary to the rest of medicine, where differential treatment effects are to be expected. Why, therefore, is there confusion? A dimensional model for depression homogenises the multiple underlying subtypes of depression. This leads to treatments being tested as having universal application instead of targeting the specific depressive subtypes. This largely underpins the lack of specificity in RCT evidence. These trials involve patients who bear little resemblance to those who clinicians see in everyday practice. These trials also select and favour natural and rapid responders. Therefore the failure to differentiate between drug and placebo is unsurprising in the RCTs. Our spectrum model seeks to identify clinically meaningful expressions of depression, allowing drugs to be targeted to separate depressive conditions and their underlying cause. This allows a rational model for prevention and long-term management. For example, when treating depression associated with anxiety, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) produce a high response in patients with internalised anxious worrying or externalised irritability. Not only do they treat the depression but also the fundamental cause. In summary, efficacy data will continue to provide little meaningful clinical information while treatments are tested as \"universal\" in reference to non-specific conditions such as \"major depression\". Through use of the spectrum model, therapy can be better fitted to depression subtype, through identification of clinical phenotypes and their causes."}, {"Title": "The Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test can predict social functioning among schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine.", "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to find out whether clinical symptoms, such as positive and negative symptoms, or cognitive problems, such as impairment in memory, are predictive of social outcome among patients with schizophrenia and treated with clozapine in the long-term.

Subjects were assessed at baseline, and 6, 12 and 24 months, using symptoms measures, the Social Behaviour Scale (SBS) and the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT), which tests episodic memory. Three multivariate stepwise regression models were created with SBS at 6, 12 and 24 months score as dependent variable, and the other measures at baseline as independent variables.

Acceptance in science is always provisional; changing paradigms, frameworks of enquiry and raising new questions is integral to break through in scientific knowledge.

Therapeutic undertreatment was more often found in the group of GPs. Referrals were found not to be oriented towards guidelines. After six to eight weeks, one half of patients reported a reduction in depressed symptoms, the other half of patients reported a stagnation or even a progression.\nThe study has shown that physicians in outpatient settings still fail to orient themselves towards guideline recommendations.

Genetic association has been reported between a synonymous 102T/C polymorphism in the gene encoding HTR2A and a number of clinical phenotypes, including schizophrenia, clozapine response, psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease and certain features of depression. Given that there are no known effects of the 102T/C polymorphism on the structure of the receptor, attention has switched to the possibility that the observations of both altered expression and genetic association point to functional sequence variants that alter expression of the HTR2A gene. Moreover, data have been presented recently suggesting that mRNAs containing the 102T- and C-alleles are differentially expressed. This suggests a direct effect of the variant itself on mRNA levels, or the influence of a distinct regulatory variant, such as the -1438A/G promoter polymorphism, with which it is in perfect linkage disequilibrium. The present study tested this hypothesis by employing a highly accurate quantitative allele- specific primer extension assay to measure the relative expression of brain mRNAs carrying each allele in 23 individuals heterozygous for the 102T/C polymorphism. Comparison between allele ratios derived from genomic DNA and mRNA from several cortical regions revealed that the 102C- and T-alleles are expressed identically. Furthermore, the absence of any interindividual variability in relative mRNA allele ratio suggests that the HTR2A locus is unlikely to contain common polymorphisms or epigenetic modification that alter HTR2A mRNA levels in adult brain, and essentially exclude such phenomena as a potential explanation for the altered expression and genetic associations that have been reported to date."}, {"Title": "Genome-wide scan in Portuguese Island families identifies 5q31-5q35 as a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia and psychosis.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a common psychiatric disorder with a complex genetic etiology.

Structured instruments were used to collect information regarding neuropsychiatric symptoms, activities of daily living and current met and unmet needs. Where discharge was delayed an assessment was made regarding the appropriateness for an intermediate care setting according to the criteria set by the Department of Health guidelines. A total of 30 (46%) patients' discharges were delayed. Of these, 19 (29%) patients met the DOH criteria for intermediate care; 10 (53%) had dementia, five (26%) affective disorder, and four (21%) with schizophrenia. The 11 other delayed discharges were because of lack of availability of finance for placements. The study found that the prompt discharge of older patients from acute psychiatric care was a significant problem and many of those patients may benefit from the therapeutic and rehabilitative process afforded by intermediate care."}, {"Title": "Olanzapine versus clozapine in treatment-resistant or treatment-intolerant schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Clozapine has been the gold standard for treatment of patients with refractory schizophrenia but is associated with serious safety liabilities. This has prompted the search for therapeutic alternatives for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of olanzapine versus clozapine in schizophrenic patients who failed to respond adequately to antipsychotic medication or who experienced intolerable adverse effects associated with the medication. This 18-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel study compared treatment with either olanzapine (5-25 mg/day, n=75) or clozapine (100-500 mg/day, n=72) in patients with schizophrenia who were nonresponsive to, or intolerant of, standard acceptable antipsychotic therapy. At the 18-week endpoint, no statistically significant differences were found between olanzapine and clozapine in any efficacy measure used: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, positive, negative, or general psychopathology or Clinical Global Impression severity (CGI-S). Response rates based on the criteria of Kane et al. [Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 45 (1988) 789] were also not significantly different between olanzapine-treated (57.9%) and clozapine-treated patients (60.8%). There were no significant differences in measurements of extrapyramidal symptoms or electrocardiography, and no clinically and statistically significant changes were seen in vital signs or laboratory measures in either group. Both treatments were well tolerated. Olanzapine demonstrated similar efficacy to clozapine in patients who had failed previous treatment because of lack of efficacy (treatment resistance) or intolerable side effects (treatment intolerance). Olanzapine therefore presents a safe alternative in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "The modulation of cocaine-induced conditioned place preferences by alcohol: effects of cocaine dose.", "Abstract": "Busse and Riley [Biol. Psychiatry 26 (2002) 1373] have recently reported that alcohol dose dependently attenuated cocaine-induced place preferences. Although the mechanism for this effect is not known, it is possible that it is due to alcohol potentiating the aversive properties of cocaine, a potentiation that masks or abates cocaine's rewarding effects in this preparation. Given that the affective properties of cocaine (both aversive and rewarding) have been reported to be dose dependent, it might be expected that alcohol's ability to affect cocaine-induced place preferences would be influenced by changes in cocaine dose. To address this possibility, the following experiments assessed the effects of alcohol (0.5 g/kg) on place preferences induced by high (20, 30 and 40 mg/kg: Experiment 1) and low (2.5 and 5 mg/kg; Experiment 2) doses of cocaine. Specifically, every other day for four cycles male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with cocaine, alcohol or one of several cocaine/alcohol combinations immediately before being placed on one side of a two-compartment place preference chamber. On alternate days, they were placed on the other side of the chamber after being injected with the drug vehicle(s). In Experiment 1, all doses of cocaine (20, 30 and 40 mg/kg) produced a significant preference for the drug-paired compartment, whereas alcohol alone produced no effect. When given in combination, alcohol attenuated the cocaine-induced place preference (at 30 and 40 mg/kg cocaine). In Experiment 2, neither cocaine (2.5 or 5 mg/kg) nor alcohol produced a significant effect when given alone. However, animals receiving the combination of alcohol and cocaine (5 mg/kg) displayed a significant place preference. These findings indicate that alcohol can both weaken and strengthen cocaine-induced place preferences, possibly via its effects on the rewarding and aversive properties of cocaine. The effect of alcohol is dependent on the dose of cocaine."}, {"Title": "Adult psychopathic personality with childhood-onset hyperactivity and conduct disorder: a central problem constellation in forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "To describe lifetime mental disorders among perpetrators of severe inter-personal crimes and to identify the problem domains most closely associated with aggression and a history of repeated violent criminality, we used structured interviews, clinical assessments, analyses of intellectual functioning, medical and social files, and collateral interviews in 100 consecutive subjects of pretrial forensic psychiatric investigations. Childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorders [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD), learning disability, tics and autism spectrum disorders] affected 55% of the subjects and formed complex comorbidity patterns with adult personality disorders [including psychopathic traits according to the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R)], mood disorders and substance abuse. The closest psychiatric covariates to high Lifetime History of Aggression (LHA) scores and violent recidivism were the PCL-R scores and childhood conduct disorder (CD). Behavioral and affective PCL-R factors were closely associated with childhood AD/HD, CD, and autistic traits. The results support the notion that childhood-onset social and behavioral problems form the most relevant psychiatric symptom cluster in relation to pervasive adult violent behavior, while late-onset mental disorders are more often associated with single acts of violent or sexual aggression."}, {"Title": "Assessing the needs of people with learning disabilities and mental illness: development of the Learning Disability version of the Cardinal Needs Schedule.", "Abstract": "People with learning disability (LD) experience a range of mental health problems. They are a complex population, whose needs are not well understood. This study focuses on the development of a systematic process of needs assessment for this population.\nThe Cardinal Needs Schedule used in general psychiatry was adapted for people with learning disabilities (LD). The Learning Disability version of the Cardinal Needs Schedule (LDCNS) was tested on a sample of 35 people with LD and mental illness for its inter-rater reliability.\nThe inter-rater reliability (Kappa) was calculated for 22 areas of functioning assessed by the LDCNS. Overall, there was very good agreement in seven areas, moderate agreement in six areas, fair agreement in three areas and poor agreement in one area. In four areas of functioning, Kappa could not be calculated. More needs were found in the social domain than in the clinical domain.\nA systematic needs assessment schedule (LDCNS) was developed for people with LD and mental illness. The inter-rater reliability is generally acceptable, but requires further examination."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric epidemiology of old age: the H70 study--the NAPE lecture 2003.", "Abstract": "To describe methodological issues and possibilities in the epidemiology of old age psychiatry using data from the H70 study in G\u00f6teborg, Sweden.\nA representative sample born during 1901-02 was examined at 70, 75, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 90, 92, 95, 97, 99 and 100 years of age, another during 1906-07 was examined at 70 and 79 years of age, and samples born between 1922 and 1930 were examined at 70 years of age. The study includes psychiatric examinations and key informant interviews performed by psychiatrists, physical examinations performed by geriatricians, psychometric testings, blood sampling, computerized tomographies of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid analyses, anthropometric measurements, and psychosocial background factors.\nMental disorders are found in approximately 30% of the elderly, but is seldom detected or properly treated. Incidence of depression and dementia increases with age. The relationship between blood pressure and Alzheimer's disease is an example of how cross-sectional and longitudinal studies yield completely different results. Brain imaging is an important tool in epidemiologic studies of the elderly to detect silent cerebrovascular disease and other structural brain changes. The high prevalence of psychotic symptoms is an example of the importance to use several sources of information to detect these symptoms. Dementia should be diagnosed in all types of studies in the elderly, as it influences several outcomes such as mortality, blood pressure, and rates of depression. Suicidal feelings are rare in the elderly and are strongly related to mental disorders.\nModern epidemiologic studies in population samples should be longitudinal and include assessments of psychosocial risk factors as well as comprehensive sets of biologic markers, such as brain imaging, neurochemical analyses, and genetic information to maximize the contribution that epidemiology can provide to increase our knowledge about the etiology of mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Autobiographical memory predicts the course of depression during detoxification therapy in alcohol dependent men.", "Abstract": "Recall of autobiographical memories (AM) has shown to predict the course of depression during psychiatric treatment [British Journal of Psychiatry 162 (1993)]; therefore, we assume that AM also predicts the remissive course of depression during detoxification therapy in alcohol dependent men.\nIn a longitudinal study, 65 patients were assessed twice: at admission to a detoxification unit and about 3 weeks later for follow-up. AM scores at the beginning of the detoxification program were used as predictors in hierarchical regression analyses.\nAfter controlling for initial depression, mental status and degree of alcohol dependence, AM in response to positive and aggressive cue words significantly predicted affective change. These results validate the assumption that AM is a psychological depression marker.\nNo data are reported on depression prior to drinking onset.\nAs a practical consequence, AM can assist the physician with the decision for concomittant antidepressive therapy during detoxification and rehabilitation of alcohol dependent men."}, {"Title": "Negative pathways to psychiatric care and ethnicity: the bridge between social science and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "It has been consistently reported that the African-Caribbean population in the UK are more likely than their White counterparts to access psychiatric services via the police and under compulsion. The reasons for these differences are poorly understood. This paper comprises two main parts. The first provides a comprehensive review of research in this area, arguing the current lack of understanding stems from a number of methodological limitations that characterise the research to date. The issue of ethnic variations in pathways to psychiatric care has been studied almost exclusively within a medical epidemiological framework, and the potential insights offered by sociological and anthropological research in the fields of illness behaviour and health service use have been ignored. This has important implications as the failure of research to move beyond enumerating differences in sources of referral to psychiatric services and rates of compulsory admission means no recommendations for policy or service reform have been developed from the research. The second part of the paper sets out the foundations for future research, arguing that the pathway to care has to be studied as a social process subject to a wide range of influences, including the cultural context within which illness is experienced. It is further argued that Kleinman's (Patients and healers in the context of culture: an exploration of the borderland between anthropology, medicine and psychiatry, University of California Press, Los Angeles, 1980) Health Care System model offers a particularly valuable preliminary framework for organising and interpreting future research. It is only through gaining a more qualitative understanding of the processes at work in shaping different responses to mental illness and interactions with mental health services that the patterns observed in quantitative studies can be fully understood. This further reflects the need for a bridge between the social sciences and psychiatry if services are to be developed to respond to the increasing diversity of modern societies."}, {"Title": "Hemispheric specialisation for imitation of hand-head positions and finger configurations: a controlled study in patients with complete callosotomy.", "Abstract": "Several studies of patients with unilateral brain damage and a patient with spontaneous callosal disconnection [Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry 61 (1996) 176; Neuropsychologia 37 (1999) 559; Neuropsychologia 39 (2001) 1432] suggest that the imitation of positions of the hand relative to the head is a strongly lateralised left hemispheric function. In contrast, the imitation of finger configurations draws on resources of both hemispheres with a predominance of the right hemisphere. While these findings suggest a specific pattern of imitation impairment in split-brain patients, thus far, no imitation deficits have been reported in split-brain patients. Three patients with complete callosotomy and two control groups, four patients with partial callosotomy and 10 healthy subjects, imitated hand-head positions and finger configurations with non-lateralised and tachistoscopic stimulus presentation. In addition, the influence of visual control on the imitation performance was examined. One split-brain patient showed the predicted dissociation as she had severe right hemispheric deficit in imitating hand-head positions, while finger configuration imitation was preserved. The other two split-brain patients had no impairment in hand-head position imitation. Withdrawal of visual control significantly deteriorated imitation of finger configurations in the split-brain group, but not in the controls, demonstrating that the split-brain patients relied heavily on visual control as a compensatory strategy indicating an imitation deficit in the separate hemispheres. The findings question the previously held belief that in split-brain patients both hemispheres are perfectly capable of imitating gestures and that imitation is not dependent on hemispherically specialised functions."}, {"Title": "International consensus statement on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and disruptive behaviour disorders (DBDs): clinical implications and treatment practice suggestions.", "Abstract": "Researchers and clinicians worldwide share concerns that many youngsters with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or disruptive behaviour disorders (DBDs) do not receive appropriate treatment despite availability of effective therapies. At the request of Johnson and Johnson (sponsor), 11 international experts in child and adolescent psychiatry were selected by Professor Stan Kutcher (chair) to address these concerns. This paper describes the experts' consensus conclusions, including treatment practice suggestions for physicians involved in the early treatment of youngsters with ADHD (or hyperkinetic disorder, in countries preferring this classification) and/or DBDs internationally: suggested first-line treatment for ADHD without comorbidity is psychostimulant medication aided by psychosocial intervention. For ADHD with comorbid conduct disorder (CD), psychosocial intervention combined with pharmacotherapy is suggested. For primary CD, suggested first-line treatment is psychosocial intervention, with pharmacotherapy considered as an 'add-on' when aggression/impulsivity is marked and persistent. Pharmacotherapy requires careful titration; full-day coverage is the suggested goal. Regular long-term follow-up is recommended."}, {"Title": "Diminished GABA(A) receptor-binding capacity and a DNA base substitution in a patient with treatment-resistant depression and anxiety.", "Abstract": "In this report, we describe the case of a caucasian male patient, aged 42 years, suffering from severe treatment-resistant generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks and from severe major depression, for which he was treated with a course of electroconvulsive therapy. During electroconvulsive treatment, anesthesia was difficult to induce with etomidate and, once, propofol. Bispectral indices recordings (assessing the depth of anesthesia) revealed a much shorter duration of loss of responsiveness compared to a control patient receiving also a course of electroconvulsive therapy. Since GABA receptor-mediated regulation of cortical excitability is important with respect to general anesthesia, we investigated the density of GABA(A) receptors with (123)I-iomazenil SPECT and found a clearly diminished binding of the radiotracer in the right frontal and orbitotemporal regions compared to the recordings in a 38-year-old healthy male control. Genetic analysis of the exons 7 and 8 of the GABRB1-3 genes coding for the beta1-3 subunits of the GABA(A) receptors revealed a silent G to A substitution in the third position of amino acid 257 of the beta1-subunit. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a link between insensitivity to anesthetic agents and altered GABA(A) receptor function in a clinical case. Whereas reduced GABA(A) receptor-binding capacity has been investigated in anxiety disorders, this has not been the case in depressive disorders. This case illustrates how clinical observations in psychiatry can prompt investigation by modern techniques and potentially link clinics and basic sciences. No conclusion can, however, be made about casual links in this single case [corrected]."}, {"Title": "Using pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in the treatment of psychiatric disorders: some ethical and economic considerations.", "Abstract": "Current pharmacotherapies for psychiatric disorders are generally incompletely effective. Many patients do not respond well or suffer adverse reactions to these drugs, which can result in poor patient compliance and poor treatment outcome. Adverse drug reactions and non-response are likely to be influenced by genetic polymorphisms. Pharmacogenetics holds some promise for improving the treatment of mood disorders by utilising information about genetic polymorphisms to match patients to the drug therapy that is the most effective with the fewest side effects. Pharmacogenomics promises to facilitate the development of new drugs for treatment. However, these technologies raise many ethical, economic and regulatory issues that need to be addressed before they can be integrated into psychiatry, and medicine more generally. We discuss ethical and policy issues arising from pharmacogenetic testing and pharmacogenomics research, such as informed consent, privacy and confidentiality, research on vulnerable persons and discrimination; and economic viability of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics. We conclude with recommendations for the regulation and distribution of pharmacogenetic testing services and pharmacogenomic drugs."}, {"Title": "A study of patients with spinal disease using Maudsley Personality Inventory.", "Abstract": "We administered the Maudsley Personality Inventory (MPI) preoperatively to 303 patients with spinal diseases about to undergo surgery.
