[{"Title": "Does Patient Race/Ethnicity Influence Physician Decision-Making for Diagnosis and Treatment of Childhood Disruptive Behavior Problems?", "Abstract": "Race/ethnic disparities in utilization of children's mental health care have been well documented and are particularly concerning given the long-term risks of untreated mental health problems (Institute of Medicine, 2003; Kessler et al. Am J Psychiatry 152:10026-1032, 1995). Research investigating the higher rates of unmet need among race/ethnic minority youths has focused primarily on policy, fiscal, and individual child or family factors that can influence service access and use. Alternatively, this study examines provider behavior as a potential influence on race/ethnic disparities in mental health care. The goal of the study was to examine whether patient (family) race/ethnicity influences physician diagnostic and treatment decision-making for childhood disruptive behavior problems. The study utilized an internet-based video vignette with corresponding survey of 371 randomly selected physicians from across the USA representing specialties likely to treat these patients (pediatricians, family physicians, general and child psychiatrists). Participants viewed a video vignette in which only race/ethnicity of the mother randomly varied (non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, and African American) and then responded to questions about diagnosis and recommended treatments. Physicians assigned diagnoses such as oppositional defiant disorder (48 %) and attention deficit disorder (63 %) to the child, but there were no differences in diagnosis based on race/ethnicity. The majority of respondents recommended psychosocial treatment (98 %) and/or psychoactive medication treatment (60 %), but there were no significant differences based on race/ethnicity. Thus, in this study using mock patient stimuli and controlling for other factors, such as insurance coverage, we did not find major differences in physician diagnostic or treatment decision-making based on patient race/ethnicity."}, {"Title": "[Are Mental Disorders Natural Kinds?].", "Abstract": "A problem for both philosophers of Psychiatry and Psychiatrists within the domain of nosology is to determine which could be the more appropriate model to classify mental illnesses. Such an endeavor also requires questioning the very nature of mental illness. While trying to cope with the philosophical challenges of such a task, Peter Zachar purports to show that the nosological work in Psychiatry should not adhere to the model of natural kinds. He even considers that it is mistaken to treat mental disorders as natural kinds. Nonetheless, Zachar's view on the existence of natural kinds-even in domains where there is little room for doubting about their existence, like Chemistry-is very unstable. In 2001 he holds that there are no natural kinds, but in 2008 he argues that his objections to the model of natural kinds are more the manifestation of his skepticism against a tradition. Although the problem of the existence of natural kinds shall not be dealt with in this article, a brief description on how deflated is Zachar's view on this matter in 2008 is presented, with the central part of the article devoted to reconstruct and examine his rationale for the thesis that mental disorders are not natural kinds. In the critical section of this paper, it is suggested that, although Zachar's thesis may be right, the arguments he gives to support it are quite flawed."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric disorders and omega-3 fatty acids.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders in children and adolescent are serious problem of all over the world in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry. In the recent years mood disorders occur in the earlier age. The prevalence of major depression (MD) is about 1-2% in preadolescent children and 3-8% in adolescents. When the major depression is not treated there is a big risk of worsening of symptoms, risk of suicide and development of comorbid disorders. The quality of life of the patient and its family is decreasing in the whole view. The molecular basis of major depression is not well known. The main pathomechanism of MD is in noradrenergic, serotonergic and dopaminergic pathway dysregulation, nutition factors, which can influence structure and metabolism of lipids. It was found decreased level of omega 3 fatty aids (FA), increased ratio of omega 6/omega 3 FA in the serum and in erythrocyte membrane. It is supposed that the oxidative neuronal injury can be prevented by dietary supplementation of antioxidants and that membrane phospholipids can be repaired by dietary supplementation of fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids may also participate in modulation of membrane fluidity, which influences the transmission of neurotransmitters. The membrane fluidity is affected by the ratio of phospholipids to free cholesterol. In addition, activation of the inflammatory response was found in depressive patients through increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, interferon gamma, TNF-alpha) and eicosanoids (prostaglandin E2) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. This results in increased lipid peroxidation and degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which may result in increased oxidative stress. Omega-3 fatty acids also stimulate anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) or inhibit the cyclooxygenase, platelet aggregation and formation of eicosanoids. The potential molecular mechanisms will be discussed."}, {"Title": "Mental Illness And Brain Disease.", "Abstract": "It has become common to say psychiatric illnesses are brain diseases. This reflects a conception of the mental as being biologically based, though it is also thought that thinking of psychiatric illness this way will reduce the stigma attached to psychiatric illness. If psychiatric illnesses are brain diseases, however, it is not clear why psychiatry should not collapse into neurology, and some argue for this course. Others try to maintain a distinction by saying that neurology deals with abnormalities of neural structure while psychiatry deals with specific abnormalities of neural functioning. It is not clear that neurologists would accept this division, nor that they should. I argue that if we take seriously the notion that psychiatric illnesses are mental illnesses we can draw a more defensible boundary between psychiatry and neurology. As mental illnesses, psychiatric illnesses must have symptoms that affect our mental capacities and that the sufferer is capable of being aware of, even if they are not always self-consciously aware of them. Neurological illnesses, such as stroke or multiple sclerosis, may be diagnosed even if they are silent, just as the person may not be aware of having high blood pressure or may suffer a silent myocardial infarction. It does not make sense to speak of panic disorder if the person has never had a panic attack, however, or of bipolar disorder in the absence of mood swings. This does not mean psychiatric illnesses are not biologically based. Mental illnesses are illnesses of persons, whereas other illnesses are illnesses of biological individuals."}, {"Title": "World, Time And Anxiety. Heidegger's Existential Analytic And Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Martin Heidegger was one of the most influential but also criticized philosophers of the XX century. With Being and Time 1927 he sets apart his existential analytic from psychology as well as from anthropology and from the other human sciences that deny the ontological foundation, overcoming the Cartesian dualism in search of the ontological unit of an articulated multiplicity, as human being is. Heidegger's Dasein Analytic defines the fundamental structures of human being such as being-in-the-world, a unitary structure that discloses the worldhood of the world; the modes of being (Seinsweisen), such as fear (Furcht) and anxiety (Angst); and the relationship between existence and time. In his existential analytic, anxiety is one of the fundamental moods (Grundbefindlichkeit) and it plays a pivotal role in the relationship of Dasein with time and world. The paper firstly focuses on the modes of being, underlining the importance of anxiety for the constitution of human being; secondly, it shows the relationship between anxiety and the world, and anxiety and time: rejecting both the Aristotelian description of time, as a sequence of moments that informs our common understanding of time, and the Augustine's mental account of inner time, Heidegger considers temporality under a transcendental point of view. Temporality is ek-static, it is a process through which human being comes toward and back to itself, letting itself encounter the world and the entities. The transcendental interpretation of time provided by Heidegger may give its important contribution to psychopathology."}, {"Title": "Milieu improvement in psychiatry using evidence-based practices: the long and winding road of culture change.", "Abstract": "Shorter inpatient stays have resulted in greater patient acuity, making it difficult for patients to heal and challenging for staff to manage.\nTo improve the milieu for psychiatric inpatients using evidence-based practices.\nA thorough literature review suggested 18 basic principles to improve patient outcomes while reducing violence, seclusion, restraint, and 1:1 observation.

This is the first study examining the effects of quality of life and self-esteem on each other in chronic tic disorders.\nAmong 62 patients aged between 6 and 16 years who were diagnosed with chronic tic disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV, 57 patients who met the study inclusion criteria constituted the study group and 57 age- and gender-matched individuals constituted the control group (Ethics committee file number: 2009/69; ethics committee meeting number: 2009/14 (11.06.2009); ethics committee decision number: 16). The Rosenberg self-esteem scale, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Children's Depression Inventory, Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders, Maudsley Obsessional Compulsive Inventory and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime version were applied to the children and adolescents.\nIn the study group, all quality of life subtests were found to be lower compared to the control group both in children and adolescents except for self-reported emotional functionality and social functionality. Being below the age of 12 years and female gender were found to be predictors of low self-esteem in tic disorder. In the reports obtained from the children and adolescents, low self-esteem was related with decreased quality of life in all areas except for academic functionality.\nChildren and adolescents with tic disorder experience functional disruption with a higher rate compared to the group without a psychiatric disorder or severe medical condition. Applying holistic approaches considering other clinical psychiatric symptoms as a part of chronic tic disorder will be useful in increasing the quality of life and self-esteem of these children."}, {"Title": "Fluorodeoxyglucose PET in Neurology and Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "PET imaging with the most widely available PET tracer, 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose (FDG), is a powerful tool in the differential diagnosis of numerous neurologic and psychiatric disorders, particularly in early disease stages.

In conventional SPECT scans, the typical tomographic slices are produced. In three-dimensional thresholded SPECT scans, pixels representing activity below a certain threshold are discarded. A retrospective analysis of 427 patients shows that three-dimensional thresholded SPECT scans yield a sensitivity for predicting clinical attention deficit hyperactivity disorder of 54% [95% confidence interval (CI), 46%-61%; specificity, 76%; 95% CI, 71%-81%] compared with 4% sensitivity [95% CI, 2%-8%; specificity, 97%; 95% CI, 94%-98%] for conventional SPECT scans. For 170 of the patients originating from a general psychiatry practice, conventional SPECT showed 10% sensitivity (95% CI, 4%-23%) and 98% specificity (95% CI, 93%-99%), whereas three-dimensional thresholded SPECT showed 83% sensitivity (95% CI, 68%-91%) and 77% specificity (95% CI, 69%-83%). These findings indicate that a much stronger signal is obtained when the three-dimensional thresholded SPECT scan is performed rather than the conventional SPECT scan in detecting attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and suggest similar results may be obtained for other psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Law & Psychiatry: Has the ADA Been Reborn as a Tool of Broad Community Change for People With Mental Disabilities?", "Abstract": "Twenty-five years after enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the U.S. Justice Department has begun to aggressively use the law to compel states to reform community care of individuals with mental disabilities.

In adult patients, the recommended daily dosage of mexazolam is 1-3\u00a0mg, administered three times daily. The objective of this article is to review the available information on the benzodiazepine (BZD) mexazolam and its clinical utility in treating patients with anxiety.\nThe PubMed database was searched using the keyword \"mexazolam\" with no date or language restrictions applied to the search. As only 11 papers were retrieved, some previously published manuscripts of interest known by the authors (not indexed on PubMed) have been added for completeness. Relevant information was selected for inclusion by the authors.\nA number of early studies demonstrated the ability of mexazolam to reduce anxiety symptoms with few side effects in patients with disorders associated with anxiety. Following on from this preliminary evidence, controlled studies directly comparing mexazolam with other BZDs showed that the drug is more effective than bromazepam and oxazolam, and is at least as effective as alprazolam. A larger, multicenter, phase IV study also showed that mexazolam 2 or 3\u00a0mg/day rapidly improved Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores and substantially reduced the frequency and severity of numerous somatic anxiety symptoms in patients with anxiety disorders. With regard to safety, the clinical evidence indicates that mexazolam is generally well tolerated, with a low incidence of drowsiness and sedation. Furthermore, the lack of psychomotor or cognitive performance impairment following mexazolam administration may lead to better treatment compliance.\nThe available clinical evidence suggests that mexazolam is an effective therapeutic option for the management of anxiety. However, larger, well-controlled clinical trials are needed to directly compare and contrast mexazolam's efficacy and safety with other BZDs."}, {"Title": "Franco Basaglia and the radical psychiatry movement in Italy, 1961-78.", "Abstract": "This article provides a short introduction to the life and work of Italian radical psychiatrist and mental health reformer Franco Basaglia.

Mutations in dystrophin (DMD) gene are also recognized as a cause of cognitive impairment. We aimed to determine the association between intelligence level and mutation location in DMD genes in Serbian patients with DMD. Forty-one male patients with DMD, aged 3 to 16 years, were recruited at the Clinic for Neurology and Psychiatry for Children and Youth in Belgrade, Serbia. All patients had defined DMD gene deletions or duplications [multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR)] and cognitive status assessment (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Brunet-Lezine scale, Vineland-Doll scale). In 37 patients with an estimated full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ), six (16.22%) had borderline intelligence (70<FSIQ \u226485), while seven (18.92%) were intellectually impaired (FSIQ <70). The FSIQ was not associated with proximal and distal mutations when boundaries were set at exons 30 and 45. However, FSIQ was statistically significantly associated with mutation location when we assumed their functional consequence on dystrophin isoforms and when mutations in the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) of Dp140 (exons 45-50) were assigned to affect only Dp427 and Dp260. Mutations affecting Dp140 and Dp71/Dp40 have been associated with more frequent and more severe cognitive impairment. Finally, the same classification of mutations explained the greater proportion of FSIQ variability associated with cumulative loss of dystrophin isoforms. In conclusion, cumulative loss of dystrophin isoforms increases the risk of intellectual impairment in DMD and characterizing the genotype can define necessity of early cognitive interventions in DMD patients."}, {"Title": "Bifactor structure of clinical disability in relapsing multiple sclerosis.", "Abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) can affect virtually every neurological function which complicates the conceptualization and assessment of disability.

With the end of cold war in the late eighties of the last century we have come to see much intrastate violence, in addition to usual interstate hostilities and war, arising out of religious, political, ethnic and economic differences between people. In the changed scenario peacekeeping operations have become complex politico-military-humanitarian efforts. A soldier, trained for conventional military operations, is obliged to participate in the unconventional operations of waging peace in alien lands often in volatile and violent situations and in the process he stands to get exposed to widely variable demands for adjustment that have the potential to bring to the fore many maladaptive responses. Peacekeeping operations also have the potential to offer opportunities for growth and resilience. India is a major player in peacekeeping activities for well over sixty years all over the world.

However, despite a wealth of large, longitudinal studies into prognostic factors, only very few clinically useful outcome predictors have been identified. The goal of future treatment is to either affect modifiable risk factors, or use nonmodifiable factors to parse patients into therapeutically meaningful subgroups. Most clinical outcome predictors are nonspecific and/or nonmodifiable. Nonmodifiable predictors for poor odds of remission include male sex, younger age at disease onset, poor premorbid adjustment, and severe baseline psychopathology. Modifiable risk factors for poor therapeutic outcomes that clinicians can act upon include longer duration of untreated illness, nonadherence to antipsychotics, comorbidities (especially substance-use disorders), lack of early antipsychotic response, and lack of improvement with non-clozapine antipsychotics, predicting clozapine response.

This translational circuit, termed the 'aversive amplification circuit', is thought to drive adaptive, harm-avoidant behavior in threatening environments. Here, in a natural progression of this prior work, we confirm that this circuit also plays a role in the pathological manifestation of anxiety disorders.\nForty-five unmedicated participants (N=22 generalized and social anxiety disorder/N=23 controls) recruited from Washington DC metropolitan area completed a simple emotion identification task during functional magnetic resonance imaging at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.\nAs predicted, a diagnosis by valence interaction was seen in whole-brain amygdala connectivity within the dmPFC/ACC clusters identified in our prior study; driven by significantly greater circuit coupling during fearful versus happy face processing in anxious, but not healthy, participants. Critically, and in accordance with contemporary theoretical approaches to psychiatry, circuit coupling correlated positively with self-reported anxious symptoms, providing evidence of a continuous circuit-subjective symptomatology relationship.\nWe track the functional role of a single neural circuit from its involvement in adaptive threat-biases under stress, to its chronic engagement in anxiety disorders in the absence of experimentally induced stress. Thus, we uniquely map a mood and anxiety related circuit across its adaptive and maladaptive stages. Clinically, this may provide a step towards a more mechanistic spectrum-based approach to anxiety disorder diagnosis and may ultimately lead to more targeted treatments."}, {"Title": "Cognitive training for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: meta-analysis of clinical and neuropsychological outcomes from randomized controlled trials.", "Abstract": "The authors performed meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials to examine the effects of cognitive training on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, neuropsychological deficits, and academic skills in children/adolescents with ADHD.\nThe authors searched Pubmed, Ovid, Web of Science, ERIC, and CINAHAL databases through May 18, 2014.

Rarely is there a continuation of care, which is aimed at screening for and treating this debilitating disease. Current treatment options for PTSD are held back by inconsistent efficacy, poor evidence, and a lack of understanding of its psychopathology. Without 'gold standard' assessment techniques to diagnose PTSD after an ICU admission, the development of care pathways is hindered. This paper advocates for two interwoven advances in psychiatric care (specifically for PTSD) after ICU: (1) incorporate the monitoring and treating of psychiatric co-morbidities during extended patient follow-up, and (2) rapidly adopting the latest research to maximize its benefit. The discovery that memories were not fixed, but malleable to change, set off a sequence of experiments that have revolutionized the approach to treating PTSD. It is hoped that the phenomenon of reconsolidation can be exploited therapeutically. In the act of remembering and re-storing traumatic memories, propranolol can act to dissociate the state of sympathetic arousal from their recollection. Often, ICU patients have multiple physical co-morbidities that may be exacerbated, or their treatment disrupted, by such a pervasive psychological condition. The rapid uptake of new techniques, aimed at reducing PTSD after ICU admission, is necessary to maximize the quality of care given to patients. Increasingly, the realization that the role of intensive care specialists may extend beyond the ICU is changing clinical practice. As this field advances, intensivists and psychiatrists alike must collaborate by using the latest psychopharmacology to treat their patients and combat the psychological consequences of experiencing the extremes of physiological existence."}, {"Title": "[Anti-NMDA encephalitis in psychiatry; malignant catatonia, atypical psychosis and ECT].", "Abstract": "The symptoms of malignant (lethal) catatonia has been reported similar to initial symptoms of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

Thereafter, we have also found anti-NMDAR antibody positive patients of young females with acute florid psychiatric symptoms without clinical signs of encephalitis. The features of these patients mirror-those of \"Atypical psychosis\" proposed by Mitsuda in Japan, a notion derived from \"Cycloid psychosis\" conceptualized by German psychiatrist, Leonhard. Both cycloid and atypical psychosis have coinciding features of acute onset, emotional disturbances, psychomotor disturbances, alternations of consciousness, high prevalence in women and oriented premorbid personality. Both malignant catatonia and atypical psychosis have been known to be effectively treated with modified electro convulsion therapy (m-ECT). Our 5 cases with anti-NMDAR antibody, m-ECT treatments were effective. Infectious encephalitis is contra indication of m-ECT, but this autoimmune encephalitis would be careful indication. Schizophrenia is a common, heterogeneous, and complex disorder with unknown etiology. There is established evidence of NMDAR hypofunction as a central component of the functional disconnectivity; this is one of the most accepted models for schizophrenia. Moreover, autoimmune mechanisms have been proposed to be involved, at least in subgroups of schizophrenia patients. Further research of anti-NMDAR antibody and encephalitis would be important clues for the investigation of schizophrenia, catatonia and atypical psychosis."}, {"Title": "[Mind the gap: towards integrative perspectives of psychiatry].", "Abstract": "In this century, marked advances in human genetics and brain imaging technology have finally allowed us to approach fundamental questions in psychiatry, even those in clinical psychiatry, by utilizing biological science. As of 2014, discussion on the advantages and limitations in operational diagnostic criteria, such as DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), in clinical psychiatry is becoming even more important. In contrast to most of the medical areas in which multi-disciplinal approaches are successful, factionalism augmented by mind-brain problem or mind-body problem has hampered the progress of psychiatry.

The leitmotif of this investigation is the notion of simulation, as dada artists were referred to as malingerers (simulators) of madness by the press at the time. I hypothesize that the performers imitate/simulate with drums, shouting and 'bruitist' sound poems, the noises of war, staging themselves as war neurotics in a kind of shocking clinical demonstration. Both discourses intersect in the fact that many dadaists try to dodge the draft by simulating madness. The scandalizing anti-art of dada will be understood as contagious anti-pedagogy, trying to vaccinate against the madness of the era."}, {"Title": "[Performing madness: the clinic as stage].", "Abstract": "In the second half of the nine- teenth century, clinical demonstrations became the dominant teaching method in psychiatry, playing a key role in medical-professional disputes, as well. This paper traces this widely used though historiographically neglected practice of knowledge implementation and mediation, as demonstrated in the psychiatric clinic of the Berlin Charit\u00e9 (Psychiatrische und Nervenklinik der Berliner Charit\u00e9) from 1881 to 1927. Documentation of this practice, found within individual medical records, forms the basis of this research. The concept of 'theatricality' assists in uncovering the dramatic quality of the clinical demonstration: Psychiatric knowledge was not simply disseminated through such a practice; rather, such knowledge was first performatively created through the very logic of its presentation of exemplary patient histories, as well as through the examination and diagnostic positioning of its patients. The 'success' of such presentations depended on many variables, related to staff, time, place, and other situational factors. These include the presence of appropriate lecture halls, the availability and calculated selection of patients, and the employment of specific performative techniques by doctors for the sake of producing desired results. As one effect, clinical demonstrations also encouraged patients to both learn and rehearse behavior considered relevant to the particular diagnosis that was to be demonstrated."}, {"Title": "What can we learn from the history of male anorexia nervosa?", "Abstract": "The eating disorders literature has focussed on females and little is known of the male experience. The overall image this has generated suggests a young woman in conflict with socio-cultural pressures which associate thinness with beauty. Historical studies have examined anorexia nervosa from an entirely female focus while ignoring how diagnostic categories have shaped approaches to the male body. This paper will track the case of the male with anorexia nervosa through changing theories of causation and treatment approaches, from when the condition first emerged in 1873 to the present. In doing so, we gain a valuable new insight into how anorexia nervosa has been historically gendered and the far-reaching implications this has had for diagnosis and treatment of the male sufferer. Similarities between the sexes helped to establish male anorexia as a distinct category. However, this shifted focus away from important differences, which have yet unexplored implications in the assessment, diagnosis and management of disordered eating. Throughout history, there has been constant pressure to give a precise definition to anorexia nervosa, despite being fraught with medical uncertainties. This has resulted in inevitably harmful generalisations rooted in the dominant epidemiology. This paper reveals that anorexia nervosa is a truly global phenomenon which cannot be adequately constructed through exclusive studies of the female. There is consequently a pressing need to address the dearth of research examining eating disorders in males."}, {"Title": "The \"Splendid Isolation\" of Aaron T. Beck.", "Abstract": "Aaron T. Beck's Cognitive Therapy (CT) is a school of psychotherapy, conceived in the 1960s, that is celebrated by many clinicians for having provided the scientific antidote to all that was wrong with psychoanalysis. This essay situates the origins of CT in the crisis of legitimacy in psychiatry in the 1960s and 1970s, when, among many charges, psycho- analysts had to face the accusation that analysis was not adequately scientific. Beck actually began his career as both a psychoanalyst and an experimentalist. Contrary to common triumphalist accounts, Beck created CT to be a neutral space, not a partisan one, in turbulent times. Other notable psychoanalysts also sought compromise, rather than partisanship, to bridge the transition to biomedical science. The biographical approach of this essay to the origins of Beck's CT both situates him historiographically and articulates the complex experiences of a generation of psychoanalysts otherwise opaque to standard narratives."}, {"Title": "Mental health from the perspective of primary care residents: a pilot survey.", "Abstract": "Primary care physicians are increasingly providing psychiatric care in the United States. Unfortunately, there is limited learning opportunity or exposure to psychiatry during their residency training. This survey was conducted to assess primary care resident interaction with mental health professionals and their satisfaction, knowledge, preference, and comfort with the delivery of mental health care in primary health care settings.\nOn the basis of available published literature, a 20-question survey was formulated. Following receipt of the institutional review board's approval, these questions were sent via e-mail in February 2012 to internal and family medicine residents (N = 108) at 2 teaching hospitals in southwest Virginia. Analysis of the electronically captured data resulted in a response rate of 32%. Descriptive analysis was used to examine the results.\nThe responses were equally divided among male and female residents and family medicine and internal medicine residents. There were several interesting findings from the survey. No correlations were noted between the gender of residents, type or location of the medical school, or having had a psychiatric rotation during residency and the reported comfort level treating patients with psychiatric illness or the desire to see psychiatric patients in the future. A positive correlation was found between the residents' training level and their belief about the percentage of mental health providers who have mental health problems.\nThe current training model to acclimate primary care residents to the field of mental health appears to have major limitations.

Although the mechanisms driving pathophysiology are complex and remain largely unknown, advances in the understanding of gene association and gene networks are providing significant clues to their etiology. In recent years, small noncoding RNA molecules known as microRNA (miRNA) have emerged as potential players in the pathophysiology of mental illness. These small RNAs regulate hundreds of target transcripts by modifying their stability and translation on a broad scale, influencing entire gene networks in the process. There is evidence to suggest that numerous miRNAs are dysregulated in postmortem neuropathology of neuropsychiatric disorders, and there is strong genetic support for association of miRNA genes and their targets with these conditions. This review presents the accumulated evidence linking miRNA dysregulation and dysfunction with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and autism spectrum disorders and the potential of miRNAs as biomarkers or therapeutics for these disorders. We further assess the functional roles of some outstanding miRNAs associated with these conditions and how they may be influencing the development of psychiatric symptoms."}, {"Title": "Investigating the Attitude of Graduate Psychiatrists towards Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) and Conventional Clinical Interview Examination.", "Abstract": "In the present study, we investigated the attitude of psychiatrists who graduated in 2002-2009 towards Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) and conventional clinical interview examination (Individual Patient Assessment).\nWe studied 134 psychiatrists graduated; half of whom were examined with conventional clinical interview and the others with OSCE.

In this light, the important role of informed consent in psychiatry with regard to the psychiatric act is examined. Informed consent of mental patients in treatment when they are in need of voluntary or involuntary hospitalization is further examined, while emphasis is being put on the case of involuntary treatment. The Convention for Human Rights and Biomedicine (Convention of \u039fviedo), the European Convention of Human Rights, other documents of International Organizations (UN) and specialized national legislation (A. 2071/1992, Chapter vi, Greek law) constitute basic reference and interpretation points. The examination of consent and the demarcation of the exceptions are important issues that need to be approached. More particularly, our interest lies with the article 7 of the Convention for Human Rights and Biomedicine, which specifically refers to the protection of person who suffers from a mental disorder. The opinion that informed consent in psychiatric treatment and involuntary treatment are concepts and processes which are distinct but not always mutually exclusive is enhanced. In any case, involuntary treatment causes major dilemmas as far as informed consent in the psychiatric act is concerned, as it raises issues that affect the autonomy of the person. Today, however, there are many factors which influence public politics towards the adoption of the measure of involuntary treatment within the community. How is it that this paradoxical link is legitimized and justified: involuntary treatment and community? The enactment of the above mentioned measure in many European and North American countries has created new paths in the practice of contemporary psychiatry. Nonetheless, it continues to divide the psychiatric and legal word for it causes intense questioning from a legal, ethical, deontological and clinical aspect, as it offends fundamental rights of the individual. In a legal civilization, in which the principle of informed consent or refusal constitutes a basic rule of the lawfulness of the medical and psychiatric act, any divergence from this rule has consequences for the patients and affects a well-tempered therapeutic treatment. The above mentioned measure could be counterbalanced by the legal regulation of advance directives and the provision for the appointment of a proxy person by the mental patient."}, {"Title": "[Lexical analysis on the quality of work life of hospital psychiatrists].", "Abstract": "A qualitative study was conducted in 2013 with hospital psychiatrists working in two psychiatric hospitals of different regions in order to document the quality of work life of public hospital psychiatrists.\nSemi-guided interviews were conducted with psychiatrists using an interview guide.

More recent research indicates that oxytocin may have broader pro-social effects on behavior and cognition, which points towards oxytocin's potential as an agent to help improve social cognition and functioning in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. However, new research on oxytocin has also uncovered a 'darker side', including oxytocin's possible role in social out-grouping and envy. Instead of a simple view of oxytocin as 'good' or 'bad', a more accurate depiction of oxytocin's role in social processing likely involves the presence of moderating factors. We review moderation effects in oxytocin and their implications for psychiatry. One implication is that, across diagnostic categories, oxytocin administration may have positive effects for patients with social cognitive deficits but negative effects for patients with social cognitive bias. We conclude that future intervention studies should use methods such as signal detection to measure both deficit and bias parameters of social cognition and to evaluate potential individual and contextual moderators both within and between psychiatric diagnoses in order to determine for whom oxytocin treatment may be beneficial and for whom it may actually be harmful."}, {"Title": "Ethics and the psychiatry journal editor: responsibilities and dilemmas.", "Abstract": "An array of potential ethical stumbling blocks awaits the editors of scientific journals.

The case of depressive disorders in DSM-5.", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to argue that a strictly reductionist approach to psychiatry represents a theoretical and clinical obstacle to a fruitful synthesis between neurobiological and sociocultural aspects of the sciences of mind. We examine the theoretical and practical motivations underlying this approach, by analyzing the case of depressive disorders, as defined in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), and the related removal of the \"bereavement exclusion clause.\" We first explore the claim that DSM is atheoretical, observing that, far from being atheoretical, DSM adopts an implicit, biologically inspired view of the mind; we show that such a view leads to a sort of circularity in the definition of depressive disorders, in which psychopharmacology seems to play a key role. We then turn to further problems deriving from this position, analyzing the issue of placebo effects in the treatment of depressive disorders and the philosophical question of normative preconditions for psychopathological diagnosis. Finally, we address the issue of subjectivity, which, together with the related aspect of the subject's relational context, appears to be crucial to any scientific theorizing about mental disorders, despite DSM's attempt to exclude it. Our defense of a non-reductionist view of mental disorders, however, does not imply that we endorse any sort of metaphysical dualism, or anti-diagnostic or anti-psychiatric positions.

Concerning the mental health care sector, little data exist about the Internet use of psychiatric patients. It is the scope of this current study to analyze the quantity and pattern of Internet usage among mental health patients.\nPatients from all services of the Department of Psychiatry at a university hospital were surveyed by completing a 29-item questionnaire. The data analysis included evaluation of frequencies, as well as group comparisons.\n337 patients participated in the survey, of whom 79.5% were Internet users. Social media was utilized by less than half of the users: social networks (47.8%), forums (19.4%), chats (18.7%), blogs (12.3%). 70.9% used the Internet for mental health related reasons. The contents accessed by the patients included: information on mental disorders (57.8%), information on medication (43.7%), search for mental health services (38.8%), platforms with other patients (19.8%) and platforms with mental health professionals (17.2%). Differences in the pattern of use between users with low, medium and high frequency of Internet use were statistically significant for all entities of social media (p\u2009<\u20090.01), search for mental health services (p\u2009=\u20090.017) and usage of platforms with mental health professionals (p\u2009=\u20090. 048). The analysis of differences in Internet use depending on the participants' type of mental disorder revealed no statistically significant differences, with one exception. Regarding the Internet's role in mental health care, the participants showed differing opinions: 36.2% believe that the Internet has or may have helped them in coping with their mental disorder, while 38.4% stated the contrary.\nMost psychiatric patients are Internet users. Mental health related Internet use is common among patients, mainly for information seeking. The use of social media is generally less frequent. It varies significantly between different user types and was shown to be associated with high frequency of Internet use. The results illustrate the importance of the Internet in mental health related contexts and may contribute to the further development of mental health related online offers."}, {"Title": "The many faces of dissociation: opportunities for innovative research in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "It has been claimed that the progress of psychiatry has lagged behind that of other medical disciplines over the last few decades. This may suggest the need for innovative thinking and research in psychiatry, which should consider neglected areas as topics of interest in light of the potential progress which might be made in this regard. This review is concerned with one such field of psychiatry: dissociation and dissociative disorders. Dissociation is the ultimate form of human response to chronic developmental stress, because patients with dissociative disorders report the highest frequency of childhood abuse and/or neglect among all psychiatric disorders. The cardinal feature of dissociation is a disruption in one or more mental functions. Dissociative amnesia, depersonalization, derealization, identity confusion, and identity alterations are core phenomena of dissociative psychopathology which constitute a single dimension characterized by a spectrum of severity. While dissociative identity disorder (DID) is the most pervasive condition of all dissociative disorders, partial representations of this spectrum may be diagnosed as dissociative amnesia (with or without fugue), depersonalization disorder, and other specified dissociative disorders such as subthreshold DID, dissociative trance disorder, acute dissociative disorders, and identity disturbances due to exposure to oppression. In addition to constituting disorders in their own right, dissociation may accompany almost every psychiatric disorder and operate as a confounding factor in general psychiatry, including neurobiological and psycho-pharmacological research. While an anti- dissociative drug does not yet exist, appropriate psychotherapy leads to considerable improvement for many patients with dissociative disorders."}, {"Title": "Collecting Information for Rating Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF): Sources of Information and Methods for Information Collection.", "Abstract": "Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is an assessment instrument that is known worldwide. It is widely used for rating the severity of illness. Results from evaluations in psychiatry should characterize the patients. Rating of GAF is based on collected information. The aim of the study is to identify the factors involved in collecting information that is relevant for rating GAF, and gaps in knowledge where it is likely that further development would play a role for improved scoring.\nA literature search was conducted with a combination of thorough hand search and search in the bibliographic databases PubMed, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and Campbell Collaboration Library of Systematic Reviews.\nCollection of information for rating GAF depends on two fundamental factors: the sources of information and the methods for information collection. Sources of information are patients, informants, health personnel, medical records, letters of referral and police records about violence and substance abuse. Methods for information collection include the many different types of interview - unstructured, semi-structured, structured, interviews for Axis I and II disorders, semistructured interviews for rating GAF, and interviews of informants - as well as instruments for rating symptoms and functioning, and observation. The different sources of information, and methods for collection, frequently result in inconsistencies in the information collected. The variation in collected information, and lack of a generally accepted algorithm for combining collected information, is likely to be important for rated GAF values, but there is a fundamental lack of knowledge about the degree of importance.\nResearch to improve GAF has not reached a high level. Rated GAF values are likely to be influenced by both the sources of information used and the methods employed for information collection, but the lack of research-based information about these influences is fundamental. Further development of GAF is feasible and proposals for this are presented."}, {"Title": "The pharmacodynamic properties of lurasidone and their role in its antidepressant efficacy in bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "The treatment of bipolar depression is one of the most challenging issues in contemporary psychiatry. Currently only quetiapine, the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination and recently lurasidone are officially FDA-approved against this condition. The neurobiology of bipolar depression and the possible targets of bipolar antidepressant therapy remain elusive. The current study investigated whether the pharmacodynamic properties of lurasidone fit to a previously developed model which was the first to be derived on the basis of the strict combination of clinical and preclinical data with no input from theory or opinion. The authors performed a complete and systematic review of the literature to identify the pharmacodynamic properties of lurasidone. The original model suggests that a constellation of effects on different receptors are necessary but the serotonin reuptake inhibition does not seem to play a significant role for bipolar depression. On the contrary norepinephrine activity seems to be very important. Probably the early antidepressant effect can be achieved through an agonistic activity at 5HT-1A and antagonism at alpha1 noradrenergic and 5-HT2A receptors, but the presence of a norepinephrine reuptake inhibition is essential in order to sustain it. Overall the properties of lurasidone fit well the model and add to its validity. A point that needs clarification is norepinephrine reuptake inhibition which is not yet studied for lurasidone."}, {"Title": "Research by residents: obstacles and opportunities.", "Abstract": "As the psychiatric field continues to evolve in a world with nascent mobile technology (Hilty et al., 2014), novel neuroscience and genetic research, and new payment and care models (Fried et al., 2014) it is likely that the psychiatry residents learn today will not match what they will be practicing tomorrow.

Qualitative analysis indicated three major themes (information, transition, and behaviour) and five overlapping subthemes (positive information sharing and consultation, concerns and anxieties about lack of information, life change and opportunity, home and sense of belonging, and potential conflict). Outcome data indicated little obvious change between first and second interviews. Expressed concerns of patients about transition were largely about tangible and practical issues, including changes to rules, including smoking and prohibited items.

Understanding the controversy on bipolar disorder in children.", "Abstract": "Dramatically increasing prevalence rates of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents in the United States have provoked controversy regarding the boundaries of manic symptoms in child and adolescent psychiatry. The serious impact of this ongoing debate on the treatment of affected children is reflected in the concomitant increase in prescription rates for antipsychotic medication. A key question in the debate is whether this increase in bipolar disorder in children and adolescents is based on a better detection of early-onset bipolar disorder-which can present differently in children and adolescents-or whether it is caused by an incorrect assignment of symptoms which overlap with other widely known disorders. So far, most findings suggest that the suspected symptoms, in particular chronic, non-episodic irritability (a mood symptom presenting with easy annoyance, temper tantrums and anger) do not constitute a developmental presentation of childhood bipolar disorder. Additional research based on prospective, longitudinal studies is needed to further clarify the developmental trajectories of bipolar disorder and the diagnostic status of chronic, non-episodic irritability."}, {"Title": "[Alzheimer and the discovery of Alzheimer's disease].", "Abstract": "Alzheimer was born in Germany in 1864.

Movement disorders are frequently present in mood disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, catatonia, Tourette-disorder and psychogenic movement disorder, leading to differential-diagnostic and therapeutical difficulties in everyday practice. Movement disorders due to psychopharmacotherapy can be classified as early-onset, late-onset and tardive.

At the beginning our work was made almost impossible by an extreme confusion of worldviews and theological concepts which hindered clients' communication with each other as well as the work of sociotherapy and psychotherapy. Thus it became unavoidable to elaborate a common language and value system. This task was accomplished by searching for common denominators. We traced back most problems to two main factors. The first had to do with the essence of humanness, with the main driving force of the human personality. The second related to the final value system by which human actions are judged. We located the first factor in the human aspiration for development in both the inner and outer life and in the need for community. In our department mutual help, the promotion of development and usefulness for the community came to be regarded the standards of behavior. We used these standards as coordinates in our discussions.

All patients were evaluated during the initial 3 days of their admission using the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS),the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) and a sociodemographic questionnaire. The factor structures of the psychopathological scale items were determined with factor analyses and based on the factor loadings, cluster analyses were performed. The relationships among the clusters and the clinical variables were then evaluated.\nThe factor analyses generated three factors: increased psychomotor activity, dysphoria, and psychosis. A hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to the three factor loadings, and revealed that factor 1 (increased psychomotor activity) was high in cluster 1 and that the effects of factors 2 (dysphoria) and 3 (psychosis) were high in cluster 2. Within cluster 1 (Psychomotor elevation), 39% of patients were diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder while 31.6% of patients in the cluster 2 (dysphoric-psychotic) were diagnosed with both alcohol and cannabis use disorders. Within cluster 2 (dysphoric-psychotic), 47.4% of patients had one suicide attempt and 21.1% of patients had two or more attempts during their lifetime.\nThere was a significant difference in the presence of SUDs between patients with psychomotor elevation and patients in dysphoric-psychotic cluster.

We examine the notion that the adaptive drive to social investment - prestige - provides clues to the bipolar spectrum. A seven node bipolar spectrum is proposed, based on a putative gradient of \"bipolarity\". It is conceived that this gradient may correlate with the drive to social investment (prestige). In order to test this hypothesis with proof of concept data, a case control study categorised 228 subjects into a seven node bipolar spectrum. Whilst controlling for mood elevation and depression, differences in strategic prestige (leadership) motivation (MSPM) between spectrum groups were examined. The bipolar I (S1) node had a greater strategic prestige (leadership) motivation score than the controls (S7) by 21.17 points, 95% CI [8.16, 34.18], p<.001, d=1.05, while the bipolar II (S2) node was higher than the control group by 16.73 points, 95% CI [0.92, 32.54], p=.030, d=0.84. Whilst the pseudounipolar (S3) node (those with depression and bipolar family histories; n=17) had only a marginally statistical difference in MSPM compared to controls (p=.051), the mean difference (16.98) and d value (0.86) indicated an elevated MSPM level. Prestige (leadership) motivation score positively correlated with dimensional lifetime bipolarity (Mood Disorder Questionnaire) score (rp=0.47), supporting the spectrum prestige motivation gradient notion. Evidence is presented for a genetic disposition to elevated strategic prestige (leadership) motivation.

In this paper we sought to examine the variables independently associated with suicidal ideation and behaviour in patients diagnosed with AD or depressive (DE) episode among psychiatric outpatients and in liaison psychiatry.\n370 patients who were referred to the liaison psychiatry services (including those seen in the Emergency Department) at 3 Dublin hospitals, and were clinically diagnosed with either DE or AD, based on the ICD 10 diagnostic criteria, were recruited to the study. We examined their demographic and clinical characteristics, and the associations between these and suicidal ideation and behaviour on multivariate analysis.\nYounger age, single marital status, and greater severity of depressive symptoms were significantly associated with suicidality across both diagnoses. On multivariate analysis, greater severity of depressive symptoms was associated with suicidality in those with AD (p=0.012) and DE (p=0.009). Those with AD exhibited suicidality at lower symptom scores than did those with DE but in both groups it still occurred at the highest level of severity. There were differences in the objective circumstances measure of suicide intent.\nWe used clinical diagnosis rather as the main diagnostic classification. The generalisability of this paper may be limited to consultation-liaison psychiatry settings, where suicidal ideation and behaviours are common.\nSuicidality in AD and DE has broadly similar risk factors but differ in aspects of suicide intent.

In spite of the well-known frequency of the addict comorbidity in most psychiatric disorders, the level of association between affective disorders and alcohol is still underestimated and poorly understood. The label of \"double diagnosis\" relates to a simple addition of two independent pathologies. It is suggested to consider a \"dual psychopathology\" combining the effects of one disorder on the other. Interactions between the two disorders commit a complex state calling a new clinical reading, an adapted therapeutic strategy through a necessary integration of care. Association of alcohol use disorder and affective disorder, particularly in bipolar disorders, is correlated with severity, unstable course, treatment resistance and a greater risk of suicide. Alcohol aggravates depression and hampers therapeutics. Alcohol and mania remain a dreaded danger. The mechanism of the comorbid association does not only refer to a behavioral strategy of compensation but seems strongly based on a shared and crossed vulnerability, related to the genetics of the 5HT carrier and gene Clock.

Monitoring is based on the detection of these abnormalities and their early management. The organization of this monitoring system is based on a network of doctors, mostly pediatricians, trained regularly. The objective of this review was to assess the resources, means, and results of 10 years of follow-up.\nThe Pays de la Loire network includes 24 maternity wards and 13 neonatal departments. Annual admissions are around 5000 newborns to approximately 45,000 annual births. Upon discharge of newborns, born prematurely at 34 weeks of gestation (WG) or less, or term infants with neurological problems, parents are asked to have their child monitored by a referring doctor. During the consultation, a reference document is filled out by the doctor and sent to the project manager for data collection and specific compensation for private practitioners. Standardized questionnaires were used such as the ASQ (Ages and Stage Questionnaire) completed by parents, the developmental quotient (DQ) with the L\u00e9zine Brunet-Revised test (BLR), the intelligence quotient (IQ) with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WIPPSI III) completed by psychologists employed in the network, and a questionnaire completed by the teacher at 5 years of age.\nThe network started on 1st March 2003, and 28th February 2013, after 10 years of inclusion, 10,800 children had been included. This population accounts for 2.4% of all annual births: 1.1% were included for prematurity less than 33 weeks and 0.25% were term-born infants. The characteristics of children are presented with gestational age, birth weight, and obstetric and neonatal pathologies. The percentage of these children followed was 80% at 2 years and 63% at 5 years. At 2 years, the results are presented according to gestational age with approximately 60% of children without disabilities at 25-26 WG, 73% at 27-28 WG, 77% at 29-30 WG, and 86% at 31-32 WG. Absorptions are diverse and vary according to the age of the child with physical therapy, psychomotor skill work, speech therapy, hearing and vision consultations, and psychology/psychiatry. Assessment tools were refined by specific analyses: the ASQ 24 months (completed by parents) was deemed valid and predictive with respect to IQ (abandoned in 2012), and the grid completed by the teacher was found to predict abnormalities in 5 years.\nThe Pays de la Loire monitoring network has met its initial objective, namely to detect disabilities early and provide practical help to parents in a population of vulnerable children. Benefits for professionals and other children not followed in the network were observed, with an increase in pediatricians' skills. The benefits of the evaluation results are more difficult to assess with the care than neonatal care in obstetrics. The sustainability of such a network seems assured for healthcare professionals, provided that funding is maintained by the health authorities."}, {"Title": "[Are we (child psychiatrists) pathologizing childhood?].", "Abstract": "Child psychiatry is a young discipline with great potential. Comparing the current resources that we had a few decades ago the contrast is marked. Our discipline has had a great development. The current psychiatric thinking cannot be defined based on one main theory to which all psychiatrists adhere. There is a theoretical pluralism where different models coexist in tension. The child psychiatrist requires conducting diagnostic regardless of their frame of reference without polarizing the field because not only is required to make a psychiatric diagnosis but also requires an understanding of the unique problems of the patient. Currently we have two methods of assessment and diagnosis of children with psychiatric disorders: 1) the phenomenological method (derived from DSM), and 2) the traditional method (dynamic). The best is to make use of all available resources and clinical tools. The use of psychotropic drugs in clinical practice in children and adolescents has been installed as a controversial issue in our society. These debates have great difficulty crossing ideological and clinical arguments. It is appropriate to put in discussion the use of drugs.

This can cause diagnostic confusion and uncertainty about treatment. This paper examines seven ways in which symptoms of both conditions can co-exist. The literature on this topic consists to a large extent of case reports, so that firm conclusions cannot be drawn from their examination. There is no consistent sequence in the co-occurrence of the two conditions-eating disorders sometimes precede, and sometimes follow the onset of psychosis. The advent of the psychosis, and sometimes the treatment of the psychosis can cure the eating disorder, but it can sometimes aggravate it. Psychosis is not necessarily a mark of severity in the course of an eating disorder, and food refusal can occur independent of severity in psychotic illness, but it can be a cause of death. There is some genetic association and some overlap of physiologic, cognitive and brain structure deficits in the two types of disorder. The connection between the two, however, remains speculative. The area of comorbidity and overlapping symptoms in psychiatry requires more research. Clinical recommendations include attention to the different individual ways in which these two disparate conditions often overlap."}, {"Title": "Reduced serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor in patients with first onset vitiligo.", "Abstract": "Vitiligo is an acquired pigmentary skin disease that can cause serious cosmetic problems.

Exploration of history revealed that the patient was eating hairs and clay since early childhood. As per patient she would eat hairs thrown by others. She would like the taste of hair and had strong persistent desire to eat hair and would go out searching for the same. At times she would also eat clay. However, she denied of pulling her own hairs. Physical examination of scalp and other body parts did not show any evidence of alopecia or pulling of hair/short hair.

Typically, only a minority of patients responds to treatment and meet criteria for remission as residual symptoms may persist, the result of an inadequate course of treatment and/or the presence of persistent side effects. The foremost goal of treatment should be to restore patients to full functioning and eliminate or relieve all MDD symptoms, while being virtually free of troublesome side effects. The current available pharmacological options to manage persistent depressive symptoms include augmentation or adjunctive combination strategies, both of which target selected psychobiological systems and specific mood and somatic symptoms experienced by the patient. As well, non-pharmacological interventions including psychotherapies may be used in either first-line or adjunctive approaches. However, the evidence to date with respect to available adjunct therapies is limited by few studies and those published have utilized only a small number of subjects and lack enough data to allow for a consensus of expert opinion.

Very preliminary findings suggest that the antagonists of CRF1 and A-II receptors may have anti-panic properties. However, new medications for PD are far from being implemented in clinical use. The reasons are multiple, including: the heterogeneity of the disorder, the translational validity of animal models and the insufficient use of biomarkers in preclinical/clinical studies.

Therefore, identifying key clusters of comorbidity and exploring the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms represent important steps toward improving mental health care. In the present review, we focus on the frequent association between addiction and depression. In particular, we summarize the large body of evidence from preclinical models indicating that the kappa opioid receptor (KOR), a member of the opioid neuromodulatory system, represents a central player in the regulation of both reward and mood processes. Current data suggest that the KOR modulates overlapping neuronal networks linking brainstem monoaminergic nuclei with forebrain limbic structures. Rewarding properties of both drugs of abuse and natural stimuli, as well as the neurobiological effects of stressful experiences, strongly interact at the level of KOR signaling. In addiction models, activity of the KOR is potentiated by stressors and critically controls drug-seeking and relapse. In depression paradigms, KOR signaling is responsive to a variety of stressors, and mediates despair-like responses. Altogether, the KOR represents a prototypical substrate of comorbidity, whereby life experiences converge upon common brain mechanisms to trigger behavioral dysregulation and increased risk for distinct but interacting psychopathologies."}, {"Title": "Involuntary psychiatric admission: Characteristics of the referring doctors and the doctors' experiences of being pressured.", "Abstract": "In Norway, doctors may make the decision to refer patients to involuntary psychiatric treatment.

Drawing from a longitudinal ethnographic sub-study, part of a larger 1982 birth cohort study, this paper follows the circuitous trajectories of emergent pharma-patterns among \"shantytown\" youth over a ten-year period, exploring the thickly layered and often moralized contingencies in which psychodynamic psychiatrists' intention to resist excessive pharmaceuticalization both succeed and crumble. I juxtapose these trajectories with the growing salience of an \"anti-biologizing\" explanatory framework that psychiatrists and researchers are using to pre-empt the kind of diagnostics-driven \"biopsychiatrization\" so prevalent in North America.

The aim of this paper is to explore the linkages between different components of this pharmaceutical regime through the analysis of psychotropic drug advertising in Canadian medical journals between 1950 and 1990. Advertisements stand at the nexus of macro-level processes related to the development, regulation and marketing of new drug treatments and of micro-level processes related to the use of these drug treatments, both by clinicians and lay persons. We thus examine advertisements from the angle of the mental and classificatory universes to which doctors were exposed through direct-to-prescriber advertisement strategies implemented during this period. Furthermore, we explore to what extent the rationale behind advertisements was permeated by both scientific/professional and popular narratives of mind-body connections. This paper demonstrates that, although this period was marked by paradigm shifts in the classification of mental diseases, the development of modern psychopharmacology, and the questioning of the scientific legitimacy of psychiatry, advertisements unveil a remarkable continuity: that of the mass management of anxiety-depressive disorders by primary care physicians through psychotropic drugs. Also, despite the effective resistance to specificity as shown by the constant redefinitions of diagnostic categories and therapeutic indications, our analysis suggests that the language of specificity used in the promotion of new drugs and in the various narratives of mind-body connection may have been appealing to general practitioners.

In recent years, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an alternative for individuals suffering from TRD not responding to combining antidepressants, multiple adjunctive strategies and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Although the best site for TRD-DBS is still unclear, pilot data suggests that the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) might be a key target to accomplish therapeutic efficacy in TRD patients.\nTo explore the anatomic, electrophysiologic, neurocognitive and treatment data supporting the MFB as a target for TRD-DBS.\nThe MFB connects multiple targets involved in motivated behavior, mood regulation and antidepressant response. Specific phenomenology associated with TRD can be linked specifically to the superolateral branch (sl) of the MFB (slMFB). TRD patients who received DBS-slMFB reported high response/remission rates with an improvement in functioning and no significant adverse outcomes in their physical health or neurocognitive performance.\nThe slMFB is an essential component of a network of structural and functional pathways connecting different areas possibly involved in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. Therefore, the slMFB should be considered as an exciting therapeutic target for DBS therapy to achieve a sustained relief in TRD patients.\nThere is an urgent need for clinical trials exploring DBS-slMFB in TRD.

It is considerded as a neurodeveloppemental illness resulting from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Growing evidence supports the major role of prenatal infections and inflammation in the genesis of schizophrenia. The hypothesis including viral infections has been the subject of several studies and the role of parvovirus B19 (PB19) in the onset of the disease has been suggested. However, there is, up till now, no seroepidemiological evidence of his involvement.\nTo determine the prevalence of parvovirus B19 (PB19) in schizophrenic patients and in control subjects and to examine clinical associations between viral prevalence, risk factors of infectious disease and clinical features.\nWe carried out a case-control seroepidemiological study in the Psychiatry department of Farhat-Hached general hospital of Sousse (Tunisia). We recruited108 schizophrenic patients and 108 healthy controls free from any psychotic disorder and matched for age and sex. We collected sociodemographic data, medical history, axis I comorbid disorders and infectious risk factors. We assessed patients for psychopathology and severity of illness using respectively the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI). For each study participant, blood sample was collected and levels of IgG and IgM anti-PB19 were measured using the ELISA technique.\nThe prevalence of IgG antibodies to PB19 was significantly higher in schizophrenic patients than in controls (73.1% vs 60.2%; P=0.04). There were no statistical differences between the two groups regarding the prevalence of IgM antibodies to PB19. No association was found between viral prevalence and sociodemographic data, risk factors for infection or clinical characteristics. The presence of PB19 antibodies was associated with a lower score on the PANSS negative subscale (P=0.04). No other signficative association were found.\nIn our study, prevalence of IgG antibodies to PB19 was significantly higher in schizophrenic patients than in controls. This finding supports the hypothesis of the involvement of PB19 in schizophrenia. Further studies including both virological and immunological aspects are needed to better clarify the etiopathogenic mechanisms of schizophrenia which would challenge the management of this disease."}, {"Title": "On aims and methods of psychiatry - a reminiscence of 50 years of Tinbergen's famous questions about the biology of behavior.", "Abstract": "In 1963, Nicolaas Tinbergen published an article on \"the aims and methods of ethology\" in which he identified a fundamental framework for the scientific inquiry into the understanding of biological phenomena. In particular, he emphasized to not only study what he called the \"proximate\" causes, that is, mechanism and ontogeny of a given trait, but to include evolutionary explanations, i.e., the phylogeny and adaptive properties of that trait.\nWhile influential in the field of biology and to some degree medicine, psychiatry has fallen short of adopting Tinbergen's approach. This article aims at discussing why Tinbergen's pr\u00e9cis has lost nothing of its attractiveness to psychiatry as a medical discipline. Examples will be given for the analysis of emotions, attachment and psychotherapy. Tinbergen has bequeathed to us a scientific framework that can greatly advance our understanding of psychiatric conditions and improve diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders, with similar potential for medicine in general."}, {"Title": "The association between dietary patterns, diabetes and depression.", "Abstract": "Type 2 diabetes and depression are commonly comorbid high-prevalence chronic disorders. Diet is a key diabetes risk factor and recent research has highlighted the relevance of diet as a possible risk for factor common mental disorders. This study aimed to investigate the interrelationship among dietary patterns, diabetes and depression.\nData were integrated from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (2009-2010) for adults aged 18+ (n=4588, Mean age=43yr). Depressive symptoms were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and diabetes status determined via self-report, usage of diabetic medication and/or fasting glucose levels \u2265126mg/dL and a glycated hemoglobin level \u22656.5% (48mmol/mol). A 24-h dietary recall interview was given to determine intakes. Multiple logistic regression was employed, with depression the outcome, and dietary patterns and diabetes the predictors. Covariates included gender, age, marital status, education, race, adult food insecurity level, ratio of family income to poverty, and serum C-reactive protein.\nExploratory factor analysis revealed five dietary patterns (healthy; unhealthy; sweets; 'Mexican' style; breakfast) explaining 39.8% of the total variance. The healthy dietary pattern was associated with reduced odds of depression for those with diabetes (OR 0.68, 95% CI [0.52, 0.88], p=0.006) and those without diabetes (OR 0.79, 95% CI [0.64, 0.97], p=0.029) (interaction p=0.048).

However, there was anecdotal evidence that the ethics rounds were viewed as a positive experience and that they stimulated ethical reflection.\nThe aim of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of how the ethics rounds were experienced and why the intervention in the form of ethics rounds did not succeed in improving the ethical climate for the staff.\nAn exploratory and descriptive design with a qualitative approach was adopted, using individual interviews.\nA total of 11 healthcare personnel, working in two different psychiatry outpatient clinics and with experience of participating in ethics rounds, were interviewed.\nThe study was based on informed consent and was approved by one of the Swedish Regional Ethical Review Boards.\nThe participants were generally positive about the ethics rounds. They had experienced changes by participating in the ethics rounds in the form of being able to see things from different perspectives as well as by gaining insight into ethical issues. However, these changes had not affected daily work.\nA crucial question is whether or not increased reflection ability among the participants is a good enough outcome of ethics rounds and whether this result could have been measured in patient-related outcomes. Ethics rounds might foster cooperation among the staff and this, in turn, could influence patient care.\nBy listening to others during ethics rounds, a person can learn to see things from a new angle.

(Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol, 2014), is an important, understudied topic in social epidemiology. Although the vast majority of this body of research has been descriptive, generating translational research is essential. This article offers guidance on interpreting evidence from observational studies for translation into policy, related to three policy-relevant elements of housing: receipt of affordable housing subsidies, the target population to which results generalize, and operationalization and modeling of neighborhood context. Policy translation is imperative for understanding which levers outside the health sector can be manipulated to change fundamental causes of mental health related to housing and neighborhood. Shifting from policy relevance to policy translation may be challenging, especially for understanding social causation in observational studies, but it is a necessary shift for improving population health."}, {"Title": "[Economic impact of consultation-liaison psychiatry in a French University Hospital Centre].", "Abstract": "In times of fiscal restraint for health structures, apart from the clinical input, it seems important to discuss the economic impact of liaison psychiatry. There are only a few studies on the economic added value provided by a liaison psychiatry team. In addition to this, only a few psychiatric pathologies are coded as they should be, hence we make the assumption of an additional development provided by a specialised team.\nOver a short period of 4months, in three departments of the Toulouse University Hospital Centre, the added value to the general pricing system of liaison psychiatry was studied. The population was represented by all the consecutive requests for consultations from patients over 18years old, men and women, hospitalised at that time. These three departments frequently request consultations with the psychiatry liaison team. They set a diagnostic, and if this is associated with a higher Homogeneous Group of Patients (HGP), it provides added value.\nFifty-two patients benefited from a psychiatric consultation over 4months. The results highlight a development of \u20ac\u00a08630.43 for the traumatology department, \u20ac\u00a03325.03 for the internal medicine department, and \u20ac\u00a0513.61 for the haematology department over the study period.

In order to mimic cognitive impairments in psychiatry, one approach has been to use acute administration of NMDA antagonists. This disruption in glutamatergic transmission leads to impairments in accuracy, omissions, and premature responses although findings have been inconsistent. In this study, we further investigated glutamatergic mechanisms using a novel version of the 5CSRTT, which we have previously shown to be more sensitive to cognitive enhancers. We first investigated the effects of systemic treatment with NMDA antagonists. We also carried out a preliminary investigation using targeted medial prefrontal cortex infusions of a NMDA antagonist (MK801), mGluR2/3 antagonist (LY341495), and mGluR7 negative allosteric modulator (MMPIP). Acute systemic administration of the different NMDA antagonists had no specific effects on accuracy. At higher doses PCP, ketamine, and memantine, increased omissions and affected other measures suggesting a general disruption in task performance. Only MK801 increased premature responses, and reduced omissions at lower doses suggesting stimulant like effects. None of the NMDA antagonists affected accuracy or any other measures when tested using a short stimulus challenge. Infusions of MK801 had no effect on accuracy but increased premature responses following infralimbic, but not prelimbic infusion. LY341495 had no effects in either brain region but a decrease in accuracy was observed following prelimbic infusion of MMPIP. Contrary to our hypothesis, disruptions to glutamate transmission using NMDA antagonists did not induce any clear deficits in accuracy in this modified version of the 5CSRTT. We also found that the profile of effects for MK801 differed from those observed with PCP, ketamine, and memantine. The effects of MK801 in the infralimbic cortex add to the literature indicating this brain region and glutamate play an important role in impulse control."}, {"Title": "[Where there's a Will, there's a Way?

The changed legal bases now require the use of alternatives before applying coercion as a \"last resort\". In this study we investigated whether and which alternatives are applied by psychiatrists in order to prevent coercive measures in general psychiatric hospitals and which factors are associated with their application.\nA sample of 343 psychiatrists was recruited by contacting psychiatric hospitals throughout Germany. In an online-survey attitudes to coercive measures and the use of alternatives to coercion were assessed by self-report.\nBefore initiating their most recent coercive measures almost half (46%) of the participants employed only 2 or less alternatives. Patient related, individual and structural factors were reported as reasons for the failure of such measures. The use of alternatives was associated with a more positive assessment of their effectiveness as well as a more negative attitude towards coercive measures.\nAlternative measures are applied by many psychiatrists, but are not standard practice. Thus, there is a considerable room for improved practice."}, {"Title": "What do general psychiatrists do?

In response to \"do you believe a psychiatrist is able to know what people are thinking?\", 45% of students and 57% of the public answered \"sometimes\".\nThe results have important implications for public education, as lack of awareness about psychiatry may inhibit help seeking for mental illness, and have a negative impact on recruitment to psychiatry amongst medical students."}, {"Title": "Nurses' experiences of restraint and seclusion use in short-stay acute old age psychiatry inpatient units: a qualitative study.", "Abstract": "Restraint and seclusion are often ineffective and can affect patients adversely. In this study, we explored nurses' experiences of restraint and seclusion in short-stay acute old age psychiatry inpatient units and how these experiences underpin resistance to eliminating these practices. Qualitative interviews were conducted with nurses in three old age psychiatry units in Melbourne, Australia. The results provide one overarching theme, lack of accessible alternatives to restraint and seclusion, indicating that nurses believe there are no effective, accessible alternatives to these practices. Three related themes contribute to this perception. First, an adverse interpersonal environment contributes to restraint and seclusion, which relates to undesirable consequences of poor staff-to-patient relationships. Second, an unfavourable physical environment contributes to aggression and restraint and seclusion use. Third, the practice environment influences the adoption of restraint and seclusion. The findings contribute to the limited evidence about nurses' experiences of these practices in short-stay old age psychiatry, and how account needs to be taken of these experiences and contextual influences when introducing measures to address these practices. Policies addressing these measures need to be accompanied by wide-ranging initiatives to deal with aggression, including providing appropriate education and support and addressing ethical and workplace cultural issues surrounding these practices."}, {"Title": "[Effects of Ward Interventions on Repeated Critical Incidents in Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Inpatient Care].", "Abstract": "Effects of Ward Interventions on Repeated Critical Incidents in Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Inpatient Care.

Secondly, we argue that in a future revised version of dsm-5 personality disorders affecting older persons should be referred to specifically as 'late-onset' personality disorders. Thirdly, we stress that the research programme relating to the dimensional dsm-5 model of personality disorders should involve a larger number of older persons. In addition, more research is needed with regard to the use, wording and validity of the phrase 'personality change due to a medical condition'. Those responsible for the revision of the DSM-5 should ensure that the concept 'late-onset personality disorders' is incorporated in the text.\nThe description of personality disorders in DSM-5 is confusing.

As a result of our recent studies with 100 patients suffering from bipolar disorder, we are now able to determine the levels of cortisol in scalp hair.\nTests that measure hpa activity can be divided into three categories: point measurements, stimulation tests and inhibition tests. In our recent study of bipolar patients we found that a raised level of cortisol in scalp hair was related to a later onset of bipolar disorder (in patients over 30) or to multiple psychiatric diagnoses. Lower levels of cortisol level in scalp hair of bipolar patients were observed in bipolar patients with comorbid panic disorder.\nThe use of hair analysis to measure mean cortisol levels over long periods seems to give added value to the hpa-axis tests currently used for measuring cortisol exposure. The technique may make it easier to differentiate between various subtypes of bipolar disorder."}, {"Title": "A Process-Oriented Approach to Teaching Religion and Spirituality in Psychiatry Residency Training.", "Abstract": "Although the importance of addressing issues of spirituality and religion is increasingly acknowledged within psychiatry training, many questions remain about how to best teach relevant knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Current literature on curricula highlights the importance of maintaining a clinical focus and the balance between didactic content and process issues. The authors present findings from a program evaluation study of a course on religion, spirituality, and psychiatry that deliberately takes a primarily process-oriented, clinically focused approach.\nTwo six-session courses were offered. The first course targeted fourth-year psychiatry residents and the second targeted third-year psychiatry residents. Teaching sessions consisted of brief didactics combined with extensive process-oriented discussion. A two-person faculty team facilitated the courses. Clinical case discussions were integrated throughout the curriculum. A panel of chaplains was invited to participate in one session of each course to discuss the interface between spiritual counsel and psychiatry. A modified version of the Course Impact Questionnaire, a 20-item Likert scale utilized in previous studies of spirituality curricula in psychiatry, assessed residents' personal spiritual attitudes, competency, change in professional practice, and change in professional attitudes before and after the course (N = 20). Qualitative feedback was also elicited through written comments.\nThe results from this study showed a statistically significant difference between the pre- and post-test scale for residents' self-perceived competency and change in professional practice.\nThe findings suggest improvement in competency and professional practice scores in residents who participated in this course. This points toward the overall usefulness of the course and suggests that a process-oriented approach may be effective for discussing religion and spirituality in psychiatric training."}, {"Title": "Do regulated resident working hours affect medical graduate education?

We obtained the pass rates for part I and II for years 2000-2010. Data were divided pre-DHR (2000-2003) and post-DHR (2007-2010). Results During the pre-DHR period, first- and multiple-attempt group pass rates were 80.7% and 39.0% which changed in the post-DHR period to 89.7% and 39.1% respectively. Similarly for the part II exam, the pre-DHR first- and multiple-attempt group pass rates were 60.2% and 43.5% respectively, which increased to 78.7% and 53.8%, among the post-DHR group. Overall, there was a significant increase in the first-attempt candidates pass rates for parts I and II, whereas multiple-attempt candidates did not benefit as strongly.

In addition, there are regular changes to service design and commissioning. The current political mantra is 'more and more, of better quality, for less and less, please'. We suggest that mental health services need to actively respond to these constraints and that clinical transformation is needed to move towards a more sustainable system of healthcare. Emphasis on prevention, patient empowerment and leaner, greener services is required alongside more extensive use of technologies. Focusing on these areas will make mental health services more responsive to the challenges we face and serve to future-proof psychiatry in the UK.

However, its meaning is often vague and inconsistent, its biological bases are a subject of debate, and the methods used to study it are highly heterogeneous. Most crucially, its original definition does not permit easy downward translation to more basic processes such as those studied by behavioral neuroscience, leaving the interpretation of neuroimaging results opaque. We argue for a reformulation of ToM through a systematic two-stage approach, beginning with a deconstruction of the construct into a comprehensive set of basic component processes, followed by a complementary reconstruction from which a scientifically tractable concept of ToM can be recovered."}, {"Title": "Predictive validity of the Short-Term Assessment of Risk and Treatability for violent behavior in outpatient forensic psychiatric patients.", "Abstract": "It remains unclear whether prediction of violence based on historical factors can be improved by adding dynamic risks, protective strengths, selection of person-specific key strengths or critical vulnerabilities, and structured professional judgment (SPJ). We examine this in outpatient forensic psychiatry with the Short-Term Assessment of Risk and Treatability (START) at 3 and 6 months follow-up. An incident occurred during 33 (13%) out of 252 3-month and 44 (21%) out of 211 6-month follow-up periods (n = 188 unique clients). Pearson correlations for all predictor variables were in the expected directions. Prediction of recidivism based on historical factor ratings (odds ratio [OR] = 1.10) could not be improved through the addition of dynamic risk, protective strength, or key or critical factor scores (all ORs ns). The addition of the SPJ improved the model to modest accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] = .64) but made no independent significant contribution (OR = 1.55, p = .21) for the 3-month follow-up. For the 6-month follow-up, SPJ scores also increased predictive accuracy to modest (AUC = .67) and made a significant independent contribution to the prediction of the outcome (OR = 1.98, p = .04). Multicollinearity limits were unviolated. Limitations apply, however, results are similar to those from clinical, researcher rated samples and are discussed in the light of setting specific characteristics.

He found that certain types of mothers and infants may be more likely to benefit from MIP. In addition to providing guidance on therapeutic techniques, this article also effectively outlines ways in which PTIP, as well as psychotherapy for emotional issues during pregnancy, can be better integrated into the comprehensive health care system.

This article identifies two competing moral commitments implied by this shift, both of which appeal to the notion of autonomy. It is argued that because of these commitments the Convention is in tension with more general calls in the medical ethics literature for preserving patient autonomy through support. The competing commitments within the Convention also present a particular challenge in putting the support it requires into practice.

Using the OCF in conjunction with standard diagnostic procedures led to major revisions of diagnoses for 56.5% of patients. Anxiety disorders, especially PTSD, constitute the disorder group in which the most changes were made. In order to understand how information from the OCF interview led clinicians to revise diagnoses, data from clinical discussions were analysed through qualitative content analysis. This revealed four major themes related to the reevaluation, and at times confirmation, of given clinical psychiatric diagnoses: new information; expression of distress in emotional language; expression of distress in relation to life experiences; and improved understanding of the patient's suffering. The findings suggest that the OCF may be useful for: (a) formulating culture in relation to illness experiences, (b) contextualising diagnostic categorisation, and (c) improving overall understanding of the patient that may facilitate individualised planning of treatment and therapy."}, {"Title": "The risks and responsible roles for psychiatrists who interact with the media.", "Abstract": "Journalists often turn to psychiatrists for analysis of medical, social, political, and cultural events that involve human behavior and illness. Once journalists seek their expertise, psychiatrists often rush to be helpful, which can lead to ineffective performance and to statements that may run afoul of principles of professional ethics. In this article, we discuss the bases on which the professionalism of psychiatrists may be impugned when they commit errors in their media presentations. Found within the Principles of Medical Ethics with Special Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry, the Goldwater Rule prohibits certain behaviors when psychiatrists share professional opinions with the public. We first discuss the Goldwater Rule, highlighting the events that led to its development and the professional response to its enactment. We then present a method to guide psychiatrists in their interaction with the media that will help them avoid violating ethics principles or the law. The method encourages knowledge of a framework of ethics principles that in turn guide the psychiatrist's behavior and thinking as he contemplates accepting invitations to interact with the media.

The estimated number of health care apps for mobile phones is increasing tremendously, but previous research has highlighted the lack of critical appraisal of new apps. This lack of appraisal of apps has largely been due to the lack of clinicians with technical knowledge of how to create an evidence-based app.\nWe discuss two freely available methodologies for developing Web-based mobile phone apps: a website builder and an app builder. With these, users can program not just a Web-based app, but also integrate multimedia features within their app, without needing to know any programming language.\nWe present techniques for creating a mobile Web-based app using two well-established online mobile app websites. We illustrate how to integrate text-based content within the app, as well as integration of interactive videos and rich site summary (RSS) feed information. We will also briefly discuss how to integrate a simple questionnaire survey into the mobile-based app. A questionnaire survey was administered to students to collate their perceptions towards the app.\nThese two methodologies for developing apps have been used to convert an online electronic psychiatry textbook into two Web-based mobile phone apps for medical students rotating through psychiatry in Singapore.

The case series presented here aim to highlight the difficult situation the affected children are in. We report on three cases when children have been traumatized and, in one case, even been killed by their parent who was diagnosed with epilepsy. In the first case, we describe a woman with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy who was sentenced to forensic psychiatry care for killing her child. She lived under difficult psychosocial circumstances and a suicide attempt contributed to what happened. The second case describes a man with post-traumatic seizures who was sentenced for child abuse. Ictal or postictal violence was considered in these two cases but a causal link between the violence and epilepsy has not been established. In the third case, we describe a woman with focal epilepsy and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNESs). Her child was hurt and frightened in relation to violent seizures, which were regarded as PNESs. This case series demonstrates that children of parents with epilepsy can be in a vulnerable situation. No causality has been established between the seizures and these events, so consequently other factors such as psychosocial stress, low cognitive function, and a suicide attempt must also be considered as important. When a child is hurt by a parent with epilepsy the patient must be closely examined to determine the role of the seizures. Children can also be affected by PNESs.

At the same time, the use of first generation antipsychotics continues, although it is declining in France as in other countries. In France, we lack data on the pediatric population to ensure a safe prescription, unlike other countries such as Canada and the United States. This is disturbing when many adverse events, potentially serious for young patients' health (neuromuscular complications, risk factors, cardiovascular problems) are beginning to be identified. This article reports the current French and international knowledge on antipsychotics in the pediatric population. It appears that data in the French population are nearly nonexistent and that the methodological tools used are not always relevant (population already exposed to psychotropic drugs, short studies, debatable rating scale and somatic parameters). Within this context, a safety monitoring procedure for the naive pediatric population treated with antipsychotics was developed (ETAPE study) to determine the incidence of adverse events appearing with these drugs. Safety monitoring during the 12-month study period will include clinical assessments and laboratory testing. These assessments will be performed before treatment and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the introduction of the antipsychotic drug.

The aims of the present study were to examine the use of compulsory psychiatric care before and after the reform and if this intention of the law reform was fulfilled.\nThe study was based on register data from the computerized patient administrative system of \u00d6rebro County Council. Two periods of time, two years before (I) and two years after (II) the legal change, were compared. The Swedish civic registration number was used to connect unique individuals to continuous treatment episodes comprising different forms of legal status and to identify individuals treated during both time periods.\nThe number of involuntarily admitted patients was 524 in period I and 514 in period II. CTOs were in period II used on relatively more patients in forensic psychiatric care than in general psychiatry. In all, there was a 9% decrease from period I to period II in hospital days of compulsory psychiatric care, while days on leave decreased with 60%. The number of days on leave plus days under CTOs was 26% higher in period II than the number of days on leave in period I. Among patients treated in both periods, this increase was 43%. The total number of days under any form of compulsory care (in hospital, on leave, and under CTOs) increased with five percent. Patients with the longest leaves before the reform had more days on CTOs after the reform than other patients.\nThe results indicate that the main intention of the legislator with introducing CTOs was fulfilled in the first two years after the reform in the studied county. At the same time the use of coercive psychiatric care outside hospital, and to some extent the total use of coercive in- and outpatient psychiatric care, increased.

In this study, finger print patterns, atd-angles, and palmar flexion crease patterns (PFCs) are compared between Western European adolescent teenage males, of average intellect, with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD; n = 46) and typically developing adolescent teenage males (TD; n = 49). Boys with ASD had a higher rate of discordance in their finger print patterns than TD boys. Thus, the hypothesized prenatal disturbances that play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia and severe autism might not be specific to these severe psychiatric disorders but might also be involved in the etiology of varying degrees of ASD."}, {"Title": "\"What is strange is that we don't have more children coming to us\": A habitography of child psychiatrists and scholastic pressure in Kolkata, India.", "Abstract": "The mental health of Indian school children could be expected to be a major topic of research. More people below 15 years are living in India than in any other country in the world, and India has undergone rapid social, economic, and demographic changes that have greatly increased the pressures on children to do well in school. Yet there is a striking dearth of research in this field. In this article we present the first-ever study focused on child psychiatrists in India. Based on long-term fieldwork and interviews with psychiatrists in the Kolkata metropolitan area, we present a habitography of how psychiatrists experience young people's problems. Child psychiatrists are greatly concerned about the nexus between heightened expectations of educational success and a rise of mental problems among young people. At the same time, they wonder why not many more children are coming to them with school-related complaints. To date, there is not enough research that could either confirm or disconfirm the psychiatrists' analysis of social changes, but some conclusions on the plausibility of their views can be drawn."}, {"Title": "Geographic trends of scientific output and citation practices in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Measures of research productivity are increasingly used to determine how research should be evaluated and funding decisions made. In psychiatry, citation patterns within and between countries are not known, and whether these differ by choice of citation metric.\nIn this study, we examined publication characteristics and citation practices in articles published in 50 Web of Science indexed psychiatric and relevant clinical neurosciences journals, between January 2004 and December 2009 comprising 51,072 records that produced 375,962 citations. We compared citation patterns, including self-citations, between countries using standard x(2) tests.\nWe found that most publications came from the USA, with Germany being second and UK third in productivity. USA articles received most citations and the highest citation rate with an average 11.5 citations per article. The UK received the second highest absolute number of citations, but came fourth by citation rate (9.7 citations/article), after the Netherlands (11.4 citations/article) and Canada (9.8 citations/article). Within the USA, Harvard University published most articles and these articles were the most cited, on average 20.0 citations per paper. In Europe, UK institutions published and were cited most often. The Institute of Psychiatry/Kings College London was the leading institution in terms of number of published records and overall citations, while Oxford University had the highest citation rate (18.5 citations/record). There were no differences between the self-citation practices of American and European researchers. Articles that examined some aspect of treatment in psychiatry were the most published. In terms of diagnosis, papers about schizophrenia-spectrum disorders were the most published and the most cited.\nWe found large differences between and within countries in terms of their research productivity in psychiatry and clinical neuroscience. In addition, the ranking of countries and institutions differed widely by whether productivity was assessed by total research records published, overall citations these received, or citations per paper.

In addition, symptoms of hyperthyroidism (anxiety, weight loss, hyperdefecation) were noticeable. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was marginally elevated, free triiodothyronine (T3) and free thyroxine (T4) were clearly elevated. Hence, the patient was transferred to the Department of Endocrinology.\nThyroid ultrasound revealed a diffuse goiter with a total volume of 24,8 ml. Antibody screening did not show elevated titers. The thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) test depicted a blunted TSH response. Serum levels of free glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit, prolactin and insulin-like growth factor 1 were increased.\nIn cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a hypointense lesion on the left side of the anterior pituitary gland was detected indicating a thyrotropin-secreting microadenoma with concomitant secretion of prolactin and possible secretion of human growth hormone (HGH). A thyreostatic therapy was initiated aiming at euthyreosis. For symptom control, betablockers were administered. Subsequently, the patient underwent an uncomplicated transsphenoidal resection. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a pituitary adenoma with expression of TSH, prolactin and HGH. As expected, thyroid hormones declined afterwards.\nTSHoma is rare. Diagnosis is confirmed by endocrinological testing and cranial imaging. Therapeutic options comprise transsphenoidal adenomectomy, drug therapy (somatostatin analogues, dopaminergic agonists) and irradiation.

This area has recently attracted a surge of interest in psychiatry because studies have reported the pathological activation of the habenula in patients with major depression and in animal models. The LHb plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of depression; however, how habenular neurons are activated to cause various depression symptoms, such as reduced motivation and sleep disturbance, remain unclear. We hypothesized that dysfunctional astrocytes may cause LHb hyperactivity due to the defective uptake activity of extracellular glutamate, which induces depressive-like behaviors. We examined the activity of neurons in habenular pathways and performed behavioral and sleep analyses in mice with pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the activity of the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1 in the LHb. The habenula-specific inhibition of GLT-1 increased the neuronal firing rate and the level of c-Fos expression in the LHb. Mice with reduced GLT-1 activity in the habenula exhibited a depressive-like phenotype in the tail suspension and novelty-suppressed feeding tests. These animals also displayed increased susceptibility to chronic stress, displaying more frequent avoidant behavior without affecting locomotor activity in the open-field test. Intriguingly, the mice showed disinhibition of rapid eye movement sleep, which is a characteristic sleep pattern in patients with depression. These results provide evidence that disrupting glutamate clearance in habenular astrocytes increases neuronal excitability and depressive-like phenotypes in behaviors and sleep."}, {"Title": "Which aspects of long-term outcome are predicted by positive and negative symptoms in early-onset psychosis? An exploratory eight-year follow-up study.", "Abstract": "Early-onset psychoses show substantial variability of diagnostic and functional outcome. Finding reliable prognostic factors may allow to allocate resources to those with the worst prognosis. The aim of the study was to gain new insights regarding the potential value of baseline negative and positive symptoms as predictors of outcome in psychoses of early onset.\nSixty-three patients with early-onset schizophrenia spectrum psychosis hospitalized in an adolescent psychiatry unit were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale during the index admission. Associations with diagnosis, illness course and functional outcome were analysed in mean 8 years of follow-up (range 3.4-13.5 years).\nThe mean age at the index admission and the follow-up was 16.6 \u00b1 1.2 and 24.5 \u00b1 3.0 years, respectively. A significant majority of subjects continued psychiatric treatment (95%) and had been readmitted (71%). The mortality rate was 3% (suicide and accident). Negative symptoms were related to mental health service utilization during the follow-up. General severity of symptoms, specifically positive and cognitive factors were associated with the diagnosis of schizophrenia and inversely with diagnostic shift outside the schizophrenia spectrum at the catamnesis. Poor impulse control at baseline was associated with worse functional outcome. The drug-free subgroup with no occupational/educational activity compared with the drug-treated subjects showed lower levels of baseline negative symptomatology.\nThe study findings suggest that in patients with early-onset psychosis negative and positive symptoms show a differential prognostic value. Pharmacotherapy may attenuate the effect of symptoms on functional outcome.

OATPs are found in enterocytes and hepatocytes and in brain, kidney, and other tissues. In enterocytes, OATPs facilitate the gastrointestinal absorption of certain orally administered drugs. Fruit juices such as grapefruit juice, orange juice, and apple juice contain substances that are OATP inhibitors. These fruit juices diminish the gastrointestinal absorption of certain antiallergen, antibiotic, antihypertensive, and \u03b2-blocker drugs. While there is no evidence, so far, that OATP inhibition affects the absorption of psychotropic medications, there is no room for complacency because the field is still nascent and because the necessary studies have not been conducted. Patients should therefore err on the side of caution, taking their medications at least 4 hours distant from fruit juice intake. Doing so is especially desirable with grapefruit juice, orange juice, and apple juice; with commercial fruit juices in which OATP-inhibiting substances are likely to be present in higher concentrations; with calcium-fortified fruit juices; and with medications such as atenolol and fexofenadine, the absorption of which is substantially diminished by concurrent fruit juice intake."}, {"Title": "Timely topics in pediatric psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This section of Focus on Childhood and Adolescent Mental Health presents findings on an array of topics including inflammation and child and adolescent depression, glutamatergic dysregulation and pediatric psychiatric disorders, predictors of bipolar disorder in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and the continuum between obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

This truth was discovered more than a century ago by Aloysius Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist and neuropathologist. As a psychiatrist, he described the behavioral manifestations of \"senile dementia\" in a 51-year-old female; as a neuropathologist, he was the first to recognize the significance of the senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles found in her brain after her death at age 55 years. It was Alzheimer who made the connection between these \"biomarkers\" and the symptoms of the increasingly prevalent disease that now bears his name. In recent years, the search for psychiatry-relevant biomarkers of major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disease, and other important psychiatric/neuropsychiatric disorders has intensified. Biomarkers in psychiatry and neuropsychiatry have the potential of clarifying the etiology of an ambiguous clinical presentation-making it possible, for example, to detect underlying differences between psychological maladies that have confusingly similar symptoms. In addition, attempts are now being made to classify mental disorders on the basis of biomarkers. Biomarkers may also disclose the presence of a previously unsuspected physical explanation for behavior(s) originally presumed to be \"psychiatric\" in origin. Although clinically usable biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness await validation, candidate genomic biomarkers and protein profiling of candidate biomarkers in psychiatry are rapidly gaining ground as areas of interest, with considerable future potential.

As the only known orexigenic hormone secreted in the periphery, it increases hunger and appetite, promoting food intake. Ghrelin has also been shown to be involved in various physiological processes being regulated in the central nervous system such as sleep, mood, memory and reward. Accordingly, it has been implicated in a series of psychiatric disorders, making it subject of increasing investigation, with knowledge rapidly accumulating. This review aims at providing a concise yet comprehensive overview of the role of ghrelin in psychiatric disorders. Ghrelin was consistently shown to exert neuroprotective and memory-enhancing effects and alleviated psychopathology in animal models of dementia. Few human studies show a disruption of the ghrelin system in dementia. It was also shown to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of addictive disorders, promoting drug reward, enhancing drug seeking behavior and increasing craving in both animals and humans. Ghrelin's exact role in depression and anxiety is still being debated, as it was shown to both promote and alleviate depressive and anxiety-behavior in animal studies, with an overweight of evidence suggesting antidepressant effects. Not surprisingly, the ghrelin system is also implicated in eating disorders, however its exact role remains to be elucidated.

We had for aim to test our hypothesis and to validate a simple and efficient questionnaire to identify these psychiatric disorders.\nFifty-eight consenting patients with facial trauma, recruited prospectively in the 3 maxillo-facial surgery departments of the Marseille area during 3 months (December 2012-March 2013) completed a self-questionnaire based on the French version of 3 validated screening tests (Self Reported Psychopathy test, Rapid Alcohol Problem Screening test quantity-frequency, and Personal Health Questionnaire).\nThis preliminary study confirmed that psychiatric conditions detected by our questionnaire, namely alcohol abuse and dependence, substance abuse, and depression, were risk factors for facial trauma.\nMaxillo-facial surgeons are often unaware of psychiatric disorders that may be the cause of facial trauma. The self-screening test we propose allows documenting the psychiatric history of patients and implementing earlier psychiatric care."}, {"Title": "Palliative care as a primary therapeutic approach in advanced dementia: a narrative review.", "Abstract": "The goal of this narrative review was to identify and summarize the ways in which palliative care could benefit patients who have advanced dementia.\nThis case-based discussion article examines current literature on palliative care for dementia.\nDementia is an incurable, progressive disease that affects millions of subjects. The prevalence has grown in the last decade and is projected to continue on this trajectory. In the later stages of dementia, subjects require increasing levels of care due to severe cognitive and functional impairment. Although the field of palliative medicine focuses on improving the quality of life of patients with life-limiting illnesses, many patients with advanced dementia do not receive palliative care services.\nPalliative care has been shown to improve patient and caregiver satisfaction, quality of life, and symptom burden at the end of life. Patients with advanced dementia would benefit from increased access to palliative care."}, {"Title": "Pharmaceutical industry interactions of psychiatric trainees from 20 European countries.", "Abstract": "Interactions between the pharmaceutical industry (PI) and psychiatrists have been under scrutiny recently, though there is little empirical evidence on the nature of the relationship and its intensity at psychiatry trainee level. We therefore studied the level of PI interactions and the underlying beliefs and attitudes in a large sample of European psychiatric trainees.\nOne thousand four hundred and forty-four psychiatric trainees in 20 European countries were assessed cross-sectionally, with a 62-item questionnaire.\nThe total number of PI interactions in the preceding two months varied between countries, with least interactions in The Netherlands (M (Mean)=0.92, SD=1.44, range=0-12) and most in Portugal (M=19.06, SD=17.44, range=0-100). Trainees were more likely to believe that PI interactions have no impact on their own prescribing behaviour than that of other physicians (M=3.30, SD=1.26 vs. M=2.39, SD=1.06 on a 5-point Likert scale: 1 \"completely disagree\" to 5 \"completely agree\"). Assigning an educational role to the pharmaceutical industry was associated with more interactions and higher gift value (IRR (incidence rate ratio)=1.21, 95%CI=1.12-1.30 and OR=1.18, 95%CI=1.02-1.37).\nThere are frequent interactions between European psychiatric trainees and the PI, with significant variation between countries. We identified several factors affecting this interaction, including attribution of an educational role to the PI. Creating alternative educational opportunities and specific training dedicated to PI interactions may therefore help to reduce the impact of the PI on psychiatric training."}, {"Title": "Psychosocial interventions in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: update.", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common reason for referral to child and adolescent psychiatry clinics.

Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression are not diseases, in the medical sense, and are probably more like syndromes. Instead of spending much time and effort focusing on the mechanisms of diseases that may instead be syndromes, the author believes that psychiatrists should (1) learn more about personalising prescription via drug mechanisms, a pharmacological approach to personalised medicine; and (2) reconsider prior attempts by traditional clinical psychopharmacologists to use sophisticated clinical approaches that try to subdivide psychiatric syndromes into groups that may be more homogenous for treatment response."}, {"Title": "Stress and anxiety: counterpart elements of the stress/anxiety complex.", "Abstract": "The relationship between stress and anxiety is complicated. Stress initially arises from one's environment; anxiety overlays physiological arousal, cognitive appraisals, emotional states, and behavioral responses. Both are components of a stress-anxiety complex, which has evolved to enable individuals to adapt to their environment and achieve equilibrium. Anxiety disorders, which result when this mechanism goes awry, occur along a spectrum. One of the main variables affecting anxiety disorders is the extent of stress. Each anxiety disorder should be evaluated along a stress axis, leading to improved case conceptualization and intervention strategies."}, {"Title": "[Sources of information on suicide attempts in the Nord - Pas-de-Calais (France). Contributions and limitations].", "Abstract": "There are very few permanent indicators of mental health in France; suicidal behavior is often only understood on the basis of deaths by suicide.\nThe epidemiological interest and methodological limits of four medico-administrative databases from which data on suicide attempts can be extracted have been the subject of a study in the Nord - Pas-de-Calais Region of France: telephone calls for emergency medical assistance after suicide attempt (2009 to 2011), admissions in emergency services with a diagnosis of suicide attempt (2012), medical-surgical hospital admissions as a result of suicide attempt (2009 to 2011), and psychiatric admissions with a diagnosis of suicide attempt (2011).\nUsable data were provided by one of two emergency medical assistance units, five of thirty emergency departments and all medical-surgical and psychiatric units; in data from the latter two sources, a unique anonymous identifier gave individual statistics, while the first two covered only suicide attempts. In 2011, the number of suicide attempt calls per 100,000 inhabitants was 304, whereas the number of hospitalisations with this diagnosis was 275; rates are highest in men between 20 and 49 years of age, and in women below 20 years of age and between 40 and 49. Sources are seen to be very homogeneous with regards to the average age at which suicide took place (between 37.8 and 38.5 years, depending on the source), and to the sex (55.0% to 57.6% of women). In 2011, the number of patients with a diagnosis of suicide attempt treated in psychiatry is 2.6 times lower than the number hospitalised for suicide attempt in medical-surgical units (3563 vs 9327).\nPermanent gathering of data, and the large volume of data recorded, should encourage the use of these databases in the definition and assessment of mental health policy: an increased contribution from emergency call centers and emergency services, and the coding of the suicidal nature of intoxications by a few clearly under-declaring units, must however be achieved in order to improve this source of information."}, {"Title": "DSM 5 and child psychiatric disorders: what is new? What has changed?", "Abstract": "The significant changes in DSM 5 as these relate to a number of the child psychiatric disorders are reviewed by several authors in this special issue: In this paper we address some of the changes in the conceptual organisation of DSM 5 and specifically focus on anxiety and related disorders. In the case of child and adolescent psychiatry, the most notable feature is that the chapter on Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in infancy, Childhood or Adolescence has been deleted. Instead, a new chapter in DSM 5 describes Neurodevelopmental Disorders which typically manifest early in development. Further, an expectation had been built that DSM would be based on the latest data in neuroscience and that a clear direction towards a mixed dimensional and categorical approach would be evident. This has been the case with some disorders and a notable example is the removal of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) from the Anxiety Disorder chapter and placement with other related disorders that share similar neurobiology and treatment response. In this regard, the addition in DSM 5 of a new specifier \"tic-related\" to OCD is worth noting as there is emerging evidence that differential treatment response exists when tics are associated with OCD. The same situation applies to tics with ADHD, thus presenting the argument for a dimensional approach to Tic Spectrum Disorder (TSD) incorporating categories such as those with tics only, tics with OCD, tics with ADHD etc. to be given due consideration in the future. Another important change that clinicians in the field of child psychiatry will no doubt notice is the demise of the multiaxial classification. Instead, DSM 5 has moved back to a nonaxial documentation of diagnosis with separate notations for important psychosocial and contextual factors as well as level of functioning and disability. Clinicians are urged, however, to continue to recognise the need to understand how symptoms and behaviours might have arisen and assess relevant contextual factors such as the family relationships, quality of care, any history of abuse, and so on. Further, the move to harmonise DSM 5 with the structure of ICD 11 (scheduled for release in 2015) should make understanding and familiarising oneself with the two major classificatory systems easier in the future."}, {"Title": "Insight in psychosis: an independent predictor of outcome or an explanatory model of illness?", "Abstract": "While the traditional view within psychiatry is that insight is independent of psychopathology and predicts the course and outcome of psychosis, recent data from India argues that insight is secondary to interaction between progression of illness on one hand and local culture and social environment on the other. The findings suggest that \"insight\" is an explanatory model (EM) and may reflect attempts at coping with the devastating effects of mental disorders. Most societies are pluralistic and offer multiple, divergent and contradictory explanations for illnesses. These belief systems interact with the trajectory of the person's illness to produce a unique personal understanding, often based on a set of complex and contradictory EMs. Like all EMs, insight provides meaning to explain and overcome challenges including disabling symptoms, persistent deficits, impaired social relations and difficult livelihood issues. The persistence of distress, impairment, disability and handicap, despite regular and optimal treatment, call for explanations, which go beyond the simplistic concept of disease. People tend to choose EMs, which are non-stigmatizing and which seem to help explain and rationalize their individual concerns. The frequent presence of multiple and often contradictory EMs, held simultaneously, suggest that they are pragmatic responses at coping. The results advocate a non-judgmental approach and broad based assessment of EMs of illness and their comparison with culturally appropriate beliefs, attributions and actions. The biomedical model of illness should be presented without dismissing patient beliefs or belittling local cultural explanations for illness. Clinical practice demands a negotiation of shared model of care and treatment plan between patient and physician perspectives. The diversity of patients, problems, beliefs and cultures mandates the need to educate, match, negotiate and integrate psychiatric and psychological frameworks and interventions. It calls for multifaceted and nuanced understanding of \"insight\" and explanatory models of illness."}, {"Title": "A proposed system for classifying psychotropic drugs.", "Abstract": "Most drugs used in psychiatry are classified according to their initial or main therapeutic indications rather than by their pharmacological profiles.

The five axes of this system would describe a drug's primary pharmacological target and relevant mechanism; relevant neurotransmitter and mechanism; neurobiological activities; efficacy and side effects; and approved indications. The proposed multi-axial system is a common sense but scientifically informed approach for classifying psychotropic drugs that would be practically useful for prescribers, clinicians, and patients."}, {"Title": "Why are job stressors relevant for psychiatry?", "Abstract": "Work-related mental health disorders are a major public health problem.

Yet, theories of conditioned responses in humans, such as placebo and nocebo effects on pain, have a strong emphasis on conscious recognition of contextual cues that trigger the response. Here, we investigated the neural pathways involved in nonconscious activation of conditioned pain responses, using functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy participants. Nonconscious compared with conscious activation of conditioned placebo analgesia was associated with increased activation of the orbitofrontal cortex, a structure with direct connections to affective brain regions and basic reward processing. During nonconscious nocebo, there was increased activation of the thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. In contrast to previous assumptions about conditioning in humans, our results show that conditioned pain responses can be elicited independently of conscious awareness and our results suggest a hierarchical activation of neural pathways for nonconscious and conscious conditioned responses. Demonstrating that the human brain has a nonconscious mechanism for responding to conditioned cues has major implications for the role of associative learning in behavioral medicine and psychiatry. Our results may also open up for novel approaches to translational animal-to-human research since human consciousness and animal cognition is an inherent paradox in all behavioral science."}, {"Title": "Diagnostic stability in pediatric bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "The diagnostic stability of pediatric bipolar disorder has not been investigated previously. The aim was to investigate the diagnostic stability of the ICD-10 diagnosis of pediatric mania/bipolar disorder.\nAll patients below 19 years of age who got a diagnosis of mania/bipolar disorder at least once in a period from 1994 to 2012 at psychiatric inpatient or outpatient contact in Denmark were identified in a nationwide register.\nTotally, 354 children and adolescents got a diagnosis of mania/bipolar disorder at least once; a minority, 144 patients (40.7%) got the diagnosis at the first contact whereas the remaining patients (210; 59.3%) got the diagnosis at later contacts before age 19. For the latter patients, the median time elapsed from first treatment contact with the psychiatric service system to the first diagnosis with a manic episode/bipolar disorder was nearly 1 year and for 25% of those patients it took more than 2\u00bd years before the diagnosis was made. The most prevalent other diagnoses than bipolar disorder at first contact were depressive disorder (21.4%), acute and transient psychotic disorders or other non-organic psychosis (19.2%), reaction to stress or adjustment disorder (14.8%) and behavioral and emotional disorders with onset during childhood or adolescents (10.9%). Prevalence rates of schizophrenia, personality disorders, anxiety disorder or hyperkinetic disorders (ADHD) were low.\nData concern patients who get contact to hospital psychiatry only.\nClinicians should be more observant on manic symptoms in children and adolescents who at first glance present with transient psychosis, reaction to stress/adjustment disorder or with behavioral and emotional disorders with onset during childhood or adolescents (F90-98) and follow these patients more closely over time identifying putable hypomanic and manic symptoms as early as possible."}, {"Title": "An adaptationist perspective on the etiology of depression.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) presents with a variety of symptoms and responds to a wide range of treatment interventions. Diagnostic criteria collapse multiple syndromes with distinct etiologies into the same disorder. MDD is typically understood as a malfunction of neurotransmission or brain circuitry regulating mood, pleasure and reward, or executive function. However, research from an evolutionary perspective suggests that the \"normal\" functioning of adaptations may also generate symptoms meeting diagnostic criteria. Functioning adaptations may be an underappreciated etiological pathway to MDD. Many adaptive functions for depressive symptoms have been suggested: biasing cognition to avoid losses, conserving energy, disengaging from unobtainable goals, signaling submission, soliciting resources, and promoting analytical thinking. We review the potential role of these adaptive functions and how they can lead to specific clusters of depressive symptoms. Understanding MDD from such a perspective reduces the heterogeneity of cases and may help to select the best intervention for each patient. We discuss the implications of different adaptive and maladaptive etiological pathways for the use of antidepressants and various modes of psychotherapy. In particular, instances of MDD caused by functioning adaptations may benefit most from treatments that support the adaptive function, or that target the precipitating causal stressor. We conclude that an evolutionary approach to the study of MDD may be one of the more promising approaches to reduce its heterogeneity and to better match patients and treatment."}, {"Title": "Vitamin D and the brain: key questions for future research.", "Abstract": "Over the last decade a convergent body of evidence has emerged from epidemiology, animal experiments and clinical trials which links low vitamin D status with a range of adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes. This research demonstrates that the timing of exposure to low vitamin D influences the nature of brain phenotypes, as exposures during gestation versus adulthood result in different phenotypes. With respect to early life exposures, there is robust evidence from rodent experiments indicating that transient developmental vitamin D (DVD) deficiency is associated with changes in brain structure, neurochemistry, gene and protein expression and behavior. In particular, DVD deficiency is associated with alterations in the dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems. In contrast, recently published animal experiments indicate that adult vitamin D (AVD) deficiency is associated with more subtle neurochemical and behavioral phenotypes. This paper explores key issues that need to be addressed in future research. There is a need to define the timing and duration of the 'critical window' during which low vitamin D status is associated with differential and adverse brain outcomes. We discuss the role for 'two-hit hypotheses', which propose that adult vitamin D deficiency leaves the brain more vulnerable to secondary adverse exposures, and thus may exacerbate disease progression. Finally, we explore the evidence implicating a role for vitamin D in rapid, non-genomic mechanisms that may involve L-type calcium channels and brain function.

However, the lack of stable and reliable outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of CBT for patients with psychosis hinders further development of psychological intervention in patients with psychosis in the Chinese context. The present study therefore aims to translate selected outcomes measures developed in American and European countries to measure the effectiveness of CBT for psychosis into Chinese and evaluate their psychometric properties.\nThirty-three patients with residual psychotic symptoms were recruited in the Department of Psychiatry, Kowloon Hospital, Hong Kong. Participants were asked to complete a set of self-reported questionnaires twice with an interval of a week, including Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire-Revised (BAVQ-R), Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) and Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire (SMQ).\nThe results found that the Chinese versions of BAVQ-R, BCIS and SMQ had excellent test-retest reliability with good to acceptable internal reliability.\nGenerally, all three translated outcome measures were found to be stable and reliable, and were ready for evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive therapy for psychosis in the Chinese population.

This article discusses the genetics of complex traits in psychiatry. The complexity is accounted for by numerous factors, including multiple risk alleles, epistasis, and epigenetic effects such as methylation. Risk alleles can individually be common or rare, and can include, for example, single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variants that are transmitted or are new mutations, and other kinds of variation. Many different kinds of variation can be important for trait risk, either together in various proportions or as different factors in different subjects. Until more recently, approaches to complex traits were limited, and consequently only a few variants, usually of individually minor effect, were identified. At the present time, a much richer armamentarium exists that includes the routine application of genome-wide association studies and next-generation high-throughput sequencing and the combination of this information with other biologically relevant information, such as expression data. We have also seen the emergence of large meta-analysis and mega-analysis consortia. These developments are extremely important for psychiatric genetics, have advanced the field substantially, and promise formidable gains in the years to come as they are applied more widely."}, {"Title": "Differential typology of delusions in major depression and schizophrenia. A critique to the unitary concept of 'psychosis'.", "Abstract": "It is a current trend in psychiatry to discard the Kraepelinian dichotomy schizophrenia vs. manic-depressive illness and use the overinclusive label 'psychosis' to broadly indicate the whole spectrum of severe mental disorders. In this paper we show that the characteristics of psychotic symptoms vary across different diagnostic categories. We compare delusions in schizophrenia and major depression and demonstrate how these phenomena radically differ under these two psychopathological conditions. The identification of specific types of delusions is principally achieved through the differential description of subjective experiences. We will use two general domains to differentiate schizophrenic and depressive delusions, namely the intrinsic and extrinsic features of these phenomena. Intrinsic features are the form and content of delusions, extrinsic ones include the background from which delusions arise, that is, changes in the field of experience, background feelings, ontological framework of experience, and existential orientation. This kind of systematic exploration of the patients' experience may provide a useful integration to the standard symptom-based approach and can be used to establish a differential typology of the clinical manifestation of psychosis based on the fundamental alterations of the structures of subjectivity characterizing each mental disorder, particularly with respect to the Kraepelinian dichotomy schizophrenic vs. manic-depressive illness."}, {"Title": "Computational psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, arise from abnormalities in brain systems that underlie cognitive, emotional, and social functions.

This Perspective highlights recent progress in applying computational neuroscience to the study of mental disorders. We outline basic approaches, including identification of core deficits that cut across disease categories, biologically realistic modeling bridging cellular and synaptic mechanisms with behavior, and model-aided diagnosis.

These war neuroses were a response to the highly-industrialised nature of the warfare as well as to the fatigue engendered over four years of intense conflict. Yet while fear and mental breakdown were universal, national responses varied. A comparison of British and Belgian shell shock indicates that men suffered in very similar ways but that symptoms met with rather different responses: in Britain treatment and diagnostic regimes stressed the importance of class difference and shell shock was often linked to cowardice. These issues were not of overriding importance in the Belgian army. In the longer term shell shock became, and remained, a topic of political and social concern in Britain whereas in Belgium men suffering from kloppe (extreme fear) tended to be forgotten and the topic has not excited much popular interest or scholarly attention. Yet despite these differences one overarching theme remains clear, namely that despite the extensive experience of war neuroses during and after the First World War, there still remains a fierce stigma about the mental wounds of war."}, {"Title": "Battle for the mind: World War 1 and the birth of military psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War 1 could be viewed as a tempting opportunity to acknowledge the origins of military psychiatry and the start of a journey from psychological ignorance to enlightenment. However, the psychiatric legacy of the war is ambiguous. During World War 1, a new disorder (shellshock) and a new treatment (forward psychiatry) were introduced, but the former should not be thought of as the first recognition of what is now called post-traumatic stress disorder and the latter did not offer the solution to the management of psychiatric casualties, as was subsequently claimed. For this Series paper, we researched contemporary publications, classified military reports, and casualty returns to reassess the conventional narrative about the effect of shellshock on psychiatric practice. We conclude that the expression of distress by soldiers was culturally mediated and that patients with postcombat syndromes presented with symptom clusters and causal interpretations that engaged the attention of doctors but also resonated with popular health concerns. Likewise, claims for the efficacy of forward psychiatry were inflated. The vigorous debates that arose in response to controversy about the nature of psychiatric disorders and the discussions about how these disorders should be managed remain relevant to the trauma experienced by military personnel who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The psychiatric history of World War 1 should be thought of as an opportunity for commemoration and in terms of its contemporary relevance-not as an opportunity for self-congratulation."}, {"Title": "What Makes Residents Interested in Geriatric Psychiatry?

In the United States, a number of neuroscientific researches are designed specifically to explore legally relevant topics and a case-law has already been developed. In Europe, neuroscientific evidence is increasingly being used in criminal courtrooms, as part of psychiatric testimony, nourishing the debate about the legal implications of brain research in psychiatric-legal settings. Though largely debated, up to now the use of neuroscience in legal contexts had not specifically been regulated by any legislation. In 2011, with the new bioethics law, France has become the first country to admit by law the use of brain imaging in judicial expertise. According to the new law, brain imaging techniques can be used only for medical purposes, or scientific research, or in the context of judicial expertise. This study aims to give an overview of the current state of the neurolaw in the US and Europe, and to investigate the ethical issues raised by this new law and its potential impact on the rights and civil liberties of the offenders.\nAn overview of the emergence and development of \"neurolaw\" in the United States and Europe is given. Then, the new French law is examined in the light of the relevant debates in the French parliament. Consequently, we outline the current tendencies in Neurolaw literature to focus on assessments of responsibility, rather than dangerousness. This tendency is analysed notably in relation to the legal context relevant to criminal policies in France, where recent changes in the legislation and practice of forensic psychiatry show that dangerousness assessments have become paramount in the process of judicial decision. Finally, the potential interpretations of neuroscientific data introduced into psychiatric testimonies by judges are explored.\nThe examination of parliamentary debates showed that the new French law allowing neuroimaging techniques in judicial expertise was introduced in the aim to provide a legal framework that would protect the subject against potential misuses of neuroscience. The underlying fear above all, was that this technology be used as a lie detector, or as a means to predict the subject's behaviour. However, the possibility of such misuse remains open. Contrary to the legislator's wish, the defendant is not fully guaranteed against uses of neuroimaging techniques in criminal courts that would go against their interests and rights. In fact, the examination of the recently adopted legislation in France shows that assessments of dangerousness and of risk of recidivism have become central elements of the criminal policy, which makes it possible, if not likely that neuroimaging techniques be used for the evaluation of the dangerousness of the defendant. This could entail risks for the latter, as judges could perceive neuroscientific data as hard evidence, more scientific and reliable than the soft data of traditional psychiatry. If such neuroscientific data are interpreted as signs of potential dangerousness of a subject rather than as signs of criminal responsibility, defendants may become subjected to longer penalties or measures aiming to ensure public safety in the detriment of their freedom.\nIn the current context of accentuated societal need for security, the judge and the expert-psychiatrist are increasingly asked to evaluate the dangerousness of a subject, regardless of their responsibility.

Such uses, especially when they subjugate an individual's interest to those of society, might entail serious threats to an individual's freedom and civil liberties."}, {"Title": "[Pseudodementia, what are we talking about? Part II: From Stertz to Alzheimer: A psychogenic disease after trauma].", "Abstract": "The aim of this work is to give a new anchorage for the initial concept of pseudodementia, its basic definitions and actual clinical implications. The original definition and framework of the concept are misidentified and therefore need to be reintroduced and analysed here. This approach, beyond its heuristic and epistemological goal, has a practical aim: to adjust the psychopathological point of view on pseudodementia.\nIn addition to a conventional survey based on search engines (Medline, PsychINFO and google book), we conducted a systematic review of the concomitant papers related to the rise of the concept.\nThree moments of conceptualization are identified and linked to Wernicke's successors at the university of Breslau. Firstly, Stertz (1910) has described pseudodementia as a psychogenic illness that could occur after any trauma. According to our research, it is probably the first written use of the term pseudodementia in its psychogenic meaning. Secondly, we present Bonhoeffer's approach based on psychogenic reactions (1911). Finally, the views of Alzheimer and his student Schuppius are described: their understanding of pseudodementia is open to psychoanalytic concepts (1914).\nThe concept of pseudodementia (Pseudodemenz) takes shape in a particular period of German history: the promulgation of laws settling railway (1871) and industrial accidents (1884) but also the law of compensation of the traumatic neurosis (1889), the nosological specificity of which was debated. German psychiatry of the beginning of the 20th century was strongly imbued with a moralizing sense of national duty. The disqualification of traumatic neurosis has been followed by a unanimous recognition of traumatic hysteria and its psychogenic hypothesis. As a consequence, traumatic events were rarely taken into consideration and the issue was moved into the private sphere (Privatsache) by questioning patients' morbid wishes. Breslau's psychiatrists analyzed the cognitive disorders of pseudodementia with regard to an ideogenic model of the trauma, which emphasized the subjectivity but which was still facing the primacy of the consciousness. It is in this context, and by reducing the question of the pseudodementia to the situations of detention (Gansersche Syndrom) and pension neuroses (Rentenneurosen), that Bonhoeffer promoted the notion of \"wishing to be sick\" (Wille zur Krankheit). This conception gave a social component to mental disorders but placed in the foreground a suggestive phenomenon, which Raecke included as secondary to the primary symptom of hysterical inhibition. Thus, Schuppius's article under the tutoring of Alo\u00efs Alzheimer offers a double testimony. On one hand, it shows how neuropsychiatry was, by then, at least partially open to the notion of an unconscious causality. On the other hand, it exposes a hidden aspect of Alo\u00efs Alzheimer: a brilliant histopathologist capable of interest for psychodynamic mechanisms.\nIn his famous study of 1961, Leslie Gordon Kiloh argues that the concept of pseudodementia does not belong to any nosological system, is purely descriptive and does not imply an accurate diagnosis. The present work shows a very different conclusion. Initially, the term was introduced in German psychiatry to describe cases of hysterical psychogenic illness after trauma (psychogene Erkrankungen nach Trauma) in which the mechanism of inhibition was discussed. Topologically, we can even define its emergence in the Breslau's university and psychiatric clinic in which Wernicke, Stertz, Bonhoeffer and Alzheimer himself, promoted it. One should also note that the category of hysteria referred to an array of functional mental disorders, including \"hysterical psychosis\" (hysterische Psychosen)."}, {"Title": "[The 5 mental dimensions identified in early maladaptive schemas statistical analysis of Young's schema questionnaire (YSQ-s3)].", "Abstract": "Schemas represent a stable vision of oneself. Young's schema questionnaire-s3 (YSQ-s3) presents 90 perceptions of oneself, specifying 18 early maladaptive schemas (EMS). We studied the intensity and inter-relations of these 18 EMS and how they pool together into a specific domain.\nTwo hundred and ninety four subjects (294 patients from a French private practice in psychiatry and 12 volunteers) filled in a French version of the YSQ-s3. Item scores range from 1 to 6. Only the scores of 4 \"true for me during most of my life\" or higher were kept for the statistical analysis. Data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics, principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA).\nThe EMS mean scores ranged from 3.4 to 12.9 and standard deviations from 5.9 to 9.7. EMS score correlations range from 0.009 to 0.55. The principal component analysis (PCA), that provides linear combinations of each EMS score, yields only one meaningful component. Indeed, the screen plot that provides the eigen values associated with each principal component, suggests keeping only the first component. This component presents a size-effect and represents the \"global scores intensity\". The hierarchical clustering analysis (HC) fits the 18 EMS in 5 domains (r(2) = 0.4): (1) \"avoidance\" (with 3 EMS: emotional deprivation, social isolation/alienation, emotional inhibition), (2)\"give\" (with 1 EMS: self-sacrifice), (3) \"take\" (with 3 EMS: entitlement/grandiosity, insufficient self-control/self-discipline, approval-seeking/recognition-seeking) (4) \"awareness\" (with 8 EMS: abandonment/instability, mistrust/abuse, defectiveness/shame, dependence/incompetence, vulnerability to harm or illness, enmeshment/undeveloped self, failure, subjugation) (5) \"faith\" (with 3 EMS: negativity/pessimism, unrelenting standards/hyper-criticalness, punitiveness). When the HC analysis is applied to the population (n = 294), it yields 6 classes of patients. The mean score of the 5 domains, described above, can describe these classes.\nThese 5 domains do not completely fit Young's five \"primary infantile needs\" domains. Only 2/3 of the EMS are correctly attributed to the \"primary infantile needs\" domains. The 5 domains seem closely related to the 5 dimensions of the NEO-PI-R or to the 5 domains of personality disorders (criteria b) described in the DSM-5. In our understanding the dimensions \"avoidance, give, take\" represent 3 types of relationship to others (on behavioral level). The dimension \"awareness\" represents the fears and losses (on the emotional level) and \"faith\" represents beliefs and consciousness (on the cognitive level). The intensity of the 5 domains inside each class of patients could guide the clinical interpretation, specifically for personality disorders."}, {"Title": "Assessment of competence in surgical skills using functional magnetic resonance imaging: a feasibility study.", "Abstract": "Patient safety is fundamental to modern medical practice; safe surgery saves lives. Ensuring surgical competence is becoming more difficult at a time when surgeons are being trained in fewer hours. Accurate objective assessment of technical skills ability is lacking in standardization. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has a long history in neuroscience, psychiatry, and cognitive studies. Many studies have explored levels of perceived expertise in sports and musical ability. Little has been published on actual rather than perceived motor skills. This study sought to assess the feasibility of utilizing a novel assessment method by measuring blood oxygen level-dependent signal changes (BOLD) in specific brain regions via fMRI during a surgical skills task.\nImages were acquired using fMRI in a pilot study of 9 subjects (3 experts, 3 intermediates, and 3 novices) when performing and imagining performing a basic surgical procedure: hand tying of surgical knots. Level of expertise was based on years of experience and clinical grade. The quality and quantity of knots were assessed objectively by 2 experts who were independent of the study and blinded to the ability of the candidate. The effect of subject head motion caused by the task itself was assessed. The efficacy of fMRI data analyses in removing artifacts caused by this noise source in the data was explored.\nShifts of less than 1 voxel (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3.55 mm(3)) were recorded in all participants and were successfully corrected in all cases in the fMRI preprocessing step. Decreased BOLD activity was observed in experts compared to novices when \"knot tying\" was compared with the control \"finger tap.\" Increased BOLD activity was observed in experts compared with novices when \"imagining a task\" in the primary visual cortex, an area important in perceptual learning. Experts and intermediates performed consistently with 100% square knots. Novices had an average of 2 slip knots. Regarding knot quantity, the number of knots ranged from 14 to 26 in novices, 38 to 47 in intermediates, and 54 to 58 in experts. A Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test revealed that the difference between the 3 groups was statistically significant in the quantity of square knots tied (p = 0.147). Specific regions of interest identified concurred with findings of previous studies and included the left supramarginal, left rolandic operculum, and left postcentral regions.\nWe found that fMRI is a feasible method of exploring actual and perceived motor skill abilities. Head motion during performance of a motor skill does not preclude the attainment of meaningful data. Larger numbers are needed to further investigate these early findings."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of the potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between armodafinil and carbamazepine in healthy adults.", "Abstract": "Polypharmacy is common in psychiatry practice and can lead to an increased risk of drug interactions. Armodafinil, a wakefulness-promoting agent, has been studied as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. Armodafinil and the mood stabilizer carbamazepine are both inducers of and substrates for cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4). This study was designed to evaluate the bidirectional carbamazepine-armodafinil pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction.\nThis was an open-label, single-center study conducted in healthy adult men. Subjects assigned to group 1 received a dose of carbamazepine (200 mg) alone and a dose after pretreatment with daily dosing of armodafinil (titrated to 250 mg/d). Subjects assigned to group 2 received a dose of armodafinil (250 mg) alone and a dose after pretreatment with carbamazepine BID (titrated to 400 mg/d). Pharmacokinetic parameters for carbamazepine, armodafinil, and their major circulating metabolites were determined when dosed alone and after pretreatment with the other drug. The safety and tolerability of armodafinil and carbamazepine were also assessed throughout the study.\nEighty-one subjects enrolled in the study (group 1 = 40; group 2 = 41), of whom 79 (group 1 = 40; group 2 = 39) were evaluable for pharmacokinetic analysis and 80 (group 1 = 40; group 2 = 40) were evaluable for safety analysis. In group 1, pretreatment with armodafinil reduced systemic exposure to carbamazepine by 12% for Cmax and 25% for AUC (based on comparison of geometric means). Similarly, in group 2, pretreatment with carbamazepine reduced systemic exposure to armodafinil by 11% for Cmax and 37% for AUC. Systemic exposure to the metabolites of these agents that are formed via CYP3A4 were increased after pretreatment in each group. There were no new or unexpected adverse events.\nSystemic exposure to both carbamazepine and armodafinil was reduced after pretreatment with the other drug; systemic exposure to the metabolites of each drug, which are formed via CYP3A4, was increased. These changes were consistent with the induction of CYP3A4. Both drugs were generally safe and well tolerated alone and in combination under the conditions studied. Dose adjustment may be required when initiating or discontinuing armodafinil and carbamazepine cotherapy."}, {"Title": "Pregabalin abuse for enhancing sexual performance: case discussion and literature review.", "Abstract": "Pregabalin is a \u03b3-aminobutyric acid analogue that is primarily prescribed in psychiatry for management of generalized anxiety disorder.

This problem has not received much attention nor has the mechanism of its development. There is also a lack of understanding of the difference in the experience of abusing pregabalin in contrast to abusing other illicit drugs.

Blood sampling for the genetic assessment of mutations associated to primary dementias was performed as well: the genes investigated were FUS, C9Orf72, PSEN-1, PSEN-2.\nSerological tests were negative, neurological examination was normal, instrumental examinations showed theta waves in the posterior temporal areas bilaterally and frontotemporal cortical atrophy bilaterally. The genetic assessment of mutations associated revealed she carried a GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion (at least 80 repeats) in C9Orf72 intron 1.

Most residents described their psychotherapy as psychodynamic, once weekly, and located in a private practice not affiliated with the resident's academic center. Approximately half (49 %) were in treatment with a social worker (MSW, LCSW) or psychologist (PhD or PsyD). \"Self-awareness and understanding\" was the most commonly reported primary and contributing reason for being in psychotherapy. Close to half of the respondents (44.5 %) listed personal stress, substance dependence, mood, anxiety, or other psychiatric symptoms as the primary reason for seeking personal psychotherapy. The most common reasons for not entering psychotherapy were time and finances. Residents who were in personal psychotherapy valued personal psychotherapy as more important to training than residents who were not in personal psychotherapy. Half of all respondents reported that their program recommends psychotherapy.\nFar fewer residents responding to the survey reported being in psychotherapy than residents from some previous surveys. A continuing discussion of whether and how to accommodate personal psychotherapy in the training and education of psychiatry residents by psychiatry educators is warranted."}, {"Title": "Investigating 'place effects' on mental health: implications for population-based studies in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Background. Interest in features of our local environments that may promote better mental health and wellbeing continues to rise among decision makers. Our purpose was to highlight a selection of these challenges and some promising avenues for enhancing the quality of evidence. Method. An analysis of approximately 267,\u00a0000 people was used to test the local relative deprivation hypothesis, wherein the shortfall of a person's socioeconomic circumstances from their neighbours is said to impact negatively upon mental health. This case was used to anchor further discussion of challenges to identifying and interpreting genuine 'place effects' from spurious correlations. Results. A Median Odds Ratio of 1.29 computed via multilevel logistic regression showed that the odds of experiencing psychological distress (as measured by the Kessler score) varied by geographical area. Approximately 67% of this was attributed to a cross-classified measure of household income and neighbourhood deprivation. Compared to people on high incomes living in affluent neighbourhoods, the odds ratio of psychological distress for people on low incomes in affluent areas was 4.73 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 4.39, 5.09), whereas that for people on low incomes in deprived areas was significantly higher at 5.83 (95% CI 5.41, 6.28). Conclusions. While no evidence was found to support local relative deprivation hypothesis, the pattern suggests that more affluent areas may contain features that are conducive to better mental health. Selection of bespoke geographical boundaries, use of directed acyclic graphs and more evaluations of natural experiments are likely to be important in taking the field of enquiry onwards."}, {"Title": "Changing the obesogenic environment of severe mentally ill residential patients: ELIPS, a cluster randomised study design.", "Abstract": "Severe mentally ill (SMI) patients have a reduced life expectancy of 13-30 years compared to the general population, largely due to an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Unhealthy lifestyle behaviours in SMI patients contribute to this increased risk. The obesogenic living environment of patients in residential facilities may even pose an extra risk. Although several studies have shown positive effects of lifestyle interventions on SMI patients' weight status, studies including residential patients and their obesogenic environment are scarce. This paper describes the Effectiveness of Lifestyle Interventions in PSychiatry trial (ELIPS). The goal of this trial is to improve cardiometabolic health in severe mentally ill residential patients by addressing the obesogenic environment.\nThe ELIPS study is a multi-site cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) based on the principles of a pragmatic RCT. All residential and long-term clinical care teams of two large mental health care organisations in the North of the Netherlands serving SMI patients are invited to participate. The intervention is aimed at team level. Lifestyle coaches first develop a team specific lifestyle plan that tailors the ELIPS goals and protocol and then train teams on how to create a healthy environment and stimulate healthy behaviours in patients. After three months, teams take over the intervention after they have set out goals to achieve in the following nine months. In this phase, adherence to the lifestyle plan and pre-set goals is monitored. Patients in the control arm receive care as usual. Primary outcome measure is waist circumference at three and 12\u00a0months after baseline.\nELIPS is different from previously published lifestyle intervention studies in three ways. First, it follows the principles of a pragmatic design, which enables the examination of effects in everyday practice. Second, by implementing the intervention at team level, we expect lifestyle activities to be maintained when interventionists leave. Last, by targeting the obesogenic environment we create a prerequisite for any sustainable health improvement, as patients can only make healthy choices in a healthy living environment.\nNederlands Trialregister NTR2720 (Dutch Trial Register, www.trialregister.nl).

However, the underlying neural circuitry of these effects has not yet been investigated. Using a cross-over, double-blind, vehicle-controlled design, 22 heroin-dependent and heroin-maintained outpatients from the Centre of Substance Use Disorders at the University Hospital of Psychiatry in Basel were studied after heroin and placebo administration, while 17 healthy controls from the general population were included for placebo administration only. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to detect brain responses to fearful faces and dynamic causal modelling was applied to compute fear-induced modulation of connectivity within the emotional face network. Stress responses were assessed by hormone releases and subjective ratings. Relative to placebo, heroin acutely reduced the fear-induced modulation of connectivity from the left fusiform gyrus to the left amygdala and from the right amygdala to the right orbitofrontal cortex in dependent patients. Both of these amygdala-related connectivity strengths were significantly increased in patients after placebo treatment (acute withdrawal) compared to healthy controls, whose connectivity estimates did not differ from those of patients after heroin injection. Moreover, we found positive correlations between the left fusiform gyrus to amygdala connectivity and different stress responses, as well as between the right amygdala to orbitofrontal cortex connectivity and levels of craving. Our findings indicate that the increased amygdala-related connectivity during fearful face processing after the placebo treatment in heroin-dependent patients transiently normalizes after acute heroin maintenance treatment. Furthermore, this study suggests that the assessment of amygdala-related connectivity during fear processing may provide a prognostic tool to assess stress levels in heroin-dependent patients and to quantify the efficacy of maintenance treatments in drug addiction."}, {"Title": "Comorbidities and psychotic illness.

We have looked at the standard definition of comorbidity and then discussed whether this definition can be applied to comorbidities in psychiatry. While comorbidities in physical illness are clearly the coexistence of two independent illnesses, Comorbidities in Mental illness are the result of the polygenic nature of mental illnesses, especially in psychotic illness whether schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. As a consequence, often the comorbidities of psychiatric illness are caused by two conditions which have in common the presence of particular single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), which regulate the metabolism of neurotransmitters or the presence of neurotrophic factors . Thus inevitably, many such comorbidities are inextricably linked.

On the basis of literature, the author stresses whatever method is used to treat addict patients it is more beneficial to society than the avoidance of any intervention due to the negligence of the problem. Addictology has lost a lot from its power in Hungary. The author recommends the introduction of the methods of health quality assurance to decrease the effect of negative trends seen in addictology.

As a mistake of the point of view is it regarded that the addictological problems are classified as to belonging to the authority of psychiatry. It is emphasized that multidisciplinary approach is needed to understand the problem and to treat the client. General screening for addictological diseases does not seem possible in the light of low capacity of the system, but the screening of adolescents and pregnant women is definitely recommended.

The General Psychopathology, published by Karl Jaspers in 1913, is considered a groundbreaking work in psychiatric literature, having established psychopathology as a space of critical methodological self-reflection, and delineating a scientific methodology specific to psychiatry. With the advance of neurobiology and molecular neuroscience and its adoption in psychiatric research, however, a growing alienation between current research-oriented neuropsychiatry and the classical psychopathological literature is evident. Further, consensus-based international classification criteria, although useful for providing an internationally accepted system of reliable psychiatric diagnostic categories, further contribute to a neglect of genuinely autonomous thought on psychopathology. Nevertheless, many of the unsolved theoretical problems of psychiatry, including those in the areas of nosology, anthropology, ethics, epistemology and methodology, might be fruitfully addressed by a re-examination of classic texts, such as Jaspers's General Psychopathology, and their further development and adaptation for 21st century psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The uncanny return of the race concept.", "Abstract": "The aim of this Hypothesis and Theory is to question the recently increasing use of the \"race\" concept in contemporary genetic, psychiatric, neuroscience as well as social studies.

According to the long standing model of the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST), motivation behaviors are driven by three neurobehavioral systems mediating the sensitivity to punishment, reward or goal-conflict. Corresponding to current neurobehavioral theories in psychiatry, this theory links abnormal motivational drives to abnormal behavior; viewing depression and mania as two abnormal extremes of reward driven processes leading to either under or over approach tendencies, respectively. We revisit the RST framework in the context of bipolar disorder (BD) and challenge this concept by suggesting that dysregulated interactions of both punishment and reward related processes better account for the psychological and neural abnormalities observed in BD.

Impaired minimal self-experience may be defined as a distortion of one's first-person experiential perspective as, for example, an \"altered presence\" during which the sense of the experienced self (\"mineness\") is subtly affected, or \"altered sense of demarcation,\" i.e., a difficulty discriminating the self from the non-self. Little is known, however, about the cognitive basis of these disturbances. In fact, recent work indicates that disorders of the self are not correlated with cognitive impairments commonly found in schizophrenia such as working-memory and attention disorders. In addition, a major difficulty with exploring the minimal self experimentally lies in its definition as being non-self-reflexive, and distinct from the verbalized, explicit awareness of an \"I.\" In this paper, we shall discuss the possibility that disturbances of the minimal self observed in patients with schizophrenia are related to alterations in time processing. We shall review the literature on schizophrenia and time processing that lends support to this possibility. In particular we shall discuss the involvement of temporal integration windows on different time scales (implicit time processing) as well as duration perception disturbances (explicit time processing) in disorders of the minimal self. We argue that a better understanding of the relationship between time and the minimal self as well of issues of embodiment require research that looks more specifically at implicit time processing. Some methodological issues will be discussed."}, {"Title": "Genetics in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Today, psychiatrists are focusing on genetics aspects of various psychiatric disorders not only for a future classification of psychiatric disorders but also a notion that genetics would aid in the development of new medications to treat these disabling illnesses.

We surveyed residents from both models regarding their views of the CLPsych psychiatry experience. We also compared the scores on the Psychiatric Resident in Training Examination (PRITE). Lastly, we surveyed physicians who requested and received psychiatric consultations.\nResidents trained in the block CLPsych model reported a better education and clinical care compared longitudinal model. They also had better scores on the CLPsych section of the PRITE exam. Physicians receiving psychiatric consultations reported better overall quality of consults in the block model.\nIt appears that block CL psychiatry experiences may be better than longitudinal ones.

Sixteen mental health clinicians were recruited. Semi-structured individual interviews were used to explore their perceptions and experiences communicating a schizophrenia diagnosis. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematic analysis undertaken.\nThere were five key themes relating to the process of communication about a diagnosis of schizophrenia: (1) orientation to patient care, (2) planning of communication, (3) the impact of team leadership and inter/intra-professional functioning on communication tasks, (4) the roles of different clinicians in communicating about diagnosis and treatment, and (5) time and resource deficiencies. Despite expressing care and concern for vulnerable patients and embracing the concept of multidisciplinary teams, communicating diagnostic information to patients and families was generally unplanned for, with little consistency regarding leadership approaches, or how the team communicated diagnostic information to the patient and family. This contributed to tensions between different team members.\nThe findings demonstrated a number of issues compromising good communication around a schizophrenia diagnosis, both in terms of clinician skill and clinical context, and support the importance of education and training for all members of the multidisciplinary team about their role in the communication process."}, {"Title": "Sociodemographic characteristics and drug abuse patterns of adolescents admitted for substance use disorder treatment in Istanbul.", "Abstract": "Adolescent substance use is an increasing major health problem in developing countries.\nTo evaluate the sociodemographic characteristics and drug abuse patterns of children and youth seeking treatment in Turkey.\nThis retrospective study reviewed the demographic and clinical data of substance users who visited the substance addiction treatment clinic for children and youth in Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Research and Training Hospital for Psychiatry, Neurology and Neurosurgery in Istanbul, between January 2011 and December 2012.\nThe sample comprised of 1969 children and youth aged between 11 and 20 (346 female and 1623 male).

This paper reviews the characteristics of psychiatry in former socialist countries and discusses its implications for North Korean psychiatry. Under socialism, psychiatric disorders were attributed primarily to neurophysiologic or neurobiological origins. Psychosocial or psychodynamic etiology was denied or distorted in line with the political ideology of the Communist Party. Psychiatry was primarily concerned with psychotic disorders, and this diagnostic category was sometimes applied based on political considerations. Neurotic disorders were ignored by psychiatry or were regarded as the remnants of capitalism. Several neurotic disorders characterized by high levels of somatization were considered to be neurological or physical in nature. The majority of \"mental patients\" were institutionalized for a long periods in large-scale psychiatric hospitals. Treatment of psychiatric disorders depended largely on a few outdated biological therapies. In former socialist countries, psychodynamic psychotherapy was not common, and psychiatric patients were likely to experience social stigma. According to North Korean doctors living in South Korea, North Korean psychiatry is heavily influenced by the aforementioned traditions of psychiatry. During the post-socialist transition, the suicide rate in many of these countries dramatically increased. Given such mental health crises in post-socialist transitional societies, the field of psychiatry may face major challenges in a future unified Korea."}, {"Title": "'Introduction' to 'Episodic Psychoses', by Erik Str\u00f6mgren (1940).", "Abstract": "This anniversary Classic Text, the 'Introduction' from Str\u00f6mgren's 'Episodic Psychoses', provides a comprehensive, concise and erudite exposition of the history, nosography and nosology of these conditions.

Especially inspired by 'the psychogenic psychosis' (1916), the seminal work by his mentor, August Wimmer, he convincingly shows that the episodic psychoses constitute an intermediate link between the degeneration psychoses, now an obsolete term, and the psychogenic psychoses, reactive psychoses and brief reactive psychoses, which in their own right have been a bone of contention in international psychiatry for many decades and an obstacle in achieving consensus in international psychiatric classification."}, {"Title": "The ten most important changes in psychiatry since World War II.", "Abstract": "Writing the recent history of a subject is notoriously difficult because of the lack of perspective and impartiality.

This article seeks to explore the most significant changes occurring in Western, and especially American, psychiatry from the end of World War II up to the present by interrogating a representative selection of psychiatrists and psychologists about the subject. Over a three-year period, the author surveyed approximately 200 mental health experts on their perceptions of change in the world of psychiatric theory and practice during this enormously eventful 70-year period.

In other words, beyond simple anatomical and clinical observation, there was an effort to 'listen to' and 'read' the patient's delirium. In essence, the basic thesis which this short paper seeks to defend is that, despite a growing anatomical and clinical mind-set and a clear interest in physically locating mental illness within the body, during the Romantic period, psychiatry was able to construct a semiology largely based on the experience of the ego, on the inner world of the individual. This makes it possible to establish, from a clinical perspective, that the birth of alienism - of psychiatry - must be situated within the framework of a modernity in which the culture of subjectivity was one of its most characteristic features."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric 'diseases' in history.", "Abstract": "A history of psychiatry cannot step back from the question of psychiatric diseases, but the field has in general viewed psychiatric entities as manifestations of the human state rather than medical diseases.

Bleuler's contribution has subsequently been interpreted in two main ways. One tradition holds that Bleuler merely renamed 'dementia praecox' while conceptually continuing the Kraepelinian tradition. The other, focusing on Bleuler's characterization of 'dementia praecox' in terms of specific psychological alterations, accredits him with a genuine re-conceptualization. Based on a close reading of 'Die Prognose der Dementia praecox', the paper in which Bleuler first mentioned 'schizophrenia', we suggest a further interpretation of Bleuler's contribution and argue that the main motive for his re-conceptualization is to be found in his rejection of Kraepelinian nosology."}, {"Title": "Some reflections on madness and culture in the post-war world.", "Abstract": "This article examines the treatment of madness as a theme in drama, opera and films, concentrating its attention for the most part on the period between World War II and the 1980s.

We explored how graduating students' sex or full-time or part-time preference influences their speciality choice, taking work-life issues into account. Graduating medical students at Radboud University Medical Centre, the Netherlands participated in a survey (2008-2012) on career considerations. Logistic regression tested the influence of sex or working hour preference on speciality choice and whether work-life issues mediate. Of the responding students (N\u00a0=\u00a01,050, response rate 83, 73.3\u00a0% women), men preferred full-time work, whereas women equally opted for part time. More men chose surgery, more women family medicine. A full-time preference was associated with a preference for surgery, internal medicine and neurology, a part-time preference with psychiatry and family medicine. Both male and female students anticipated that foremost the career of women will be negatively influenced by family life. A full-time preference was associated with an expectation of equality in career opportunities or with a less ambitious partner whose career would affect family life. This increased the likelihood of a choice for surgery and reduced the preference for family medicine among female students. Gender specifically plays an important role in female graduates' speciality choice making, through considerations on career prospects and family responsibilities."}, {"Title": "Medication-administration errors in an urban mental health hospital: a direct observation study.", "Abstract": "In the present study, we aimed to identify the incidence, type, and potential clinical consequence of medication-administration errors made in a mental health hospital, and to investigate factors that might increase the risk of error. A prospective, direct observational technique was used to collect data from nurse medication rounds on each of the hospital's 43 inpatient wards. Regression analysis was used to identify potential error predictors. During the 172 medication rounds observed, 139 errors were detected in 4177 (3.3%) opportunities. The most common error was incorrect dose omission (52/139, 37%). Other common errors included incorrect dose (25/139, 18%), incorrect form (16/139, 12%), and incorrect time (12/139, 9%). Fifteen (11%) of the errors were of serious clinical severity; the rest were of negligible or minor severity. Factors that increased the risk of error included the nurse interrupting the medication round to attend to another activity, an increased number of 'when required' doses of medication administered, a higher number of patients on the ward, and an increased number of doses of medication due. These findings suggest that providers of inpatient mental health-care services should adopt medicine-administration systems that minimize task interruption and the use of 'when required' medication, as well as taking steps to reduce nursing workload."}, {"Title": "Pilot study: feasibility of using the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ) during acute suicidal crisis.", "Abstract": "Assessing youths in acute suicidal crisis is a common jet pivotal task in child and adolescent psychiatry, usually relying primarily on the clinicians skills of assessment.

Because all literature on social circuses was searched, no criterion for year of publication was used.\nNo articles on the social circus as a health intervention were found. One study on the use of the circus as an intervention in schools was identified. It demonstrated an increase in self-esteem in the children who took part. One study on the use of the circus in a First Nations community was found; it contained nonspecific, qualitative findings. The other articles identified were merely descriptions of social circuses. One website was identified on the use of the social circus to help youth who had been treated in a hospital setting for major psychiatric disorders to re-enter the community.

Pattern recognition was used to partition subjects into clusters based simultaneously on their performance in all CPT II variables. A Fisher's linear discriminant analysis was used to build a classi\ufb01er.\nUsing cluster analysis, the entire sample set was best clustered into two new groups, A and B, independently of the original diagnoses. ADHD and BD+ADHD were divided almost 50% in each subgroup, and there was an agglomeration of controls and BD in group B. Group A presented a greater impairment with higher means in all CPT II variables and lower Children's Global Assessment Scale. We found a high cross-validated classi\ufb01cation accuracy for groups A and B: 95.2%. Variability of response time was the strongest CPT II measure in the discriminative pattern between groups A and B.\nOur classificatory exercise supports the concept behind new approaches, such as the RDoC framework, for child and adolescent psychiatry.

In the early 1990s, psychiatric inpatient facilities were exempted from U.S. hospital smoking bans, in response to public outcry with national media attention. Almost 2 decades later, the current study characterizes online conversation about psychiatric hospital smoking bans. Previous commenting studies have demonstrated commenting's negativity, documenting the \"nasty effect\" wherein negative comments color perceptions of neutral articles. Thus, we focused particular attention on cited barriers to implementing health-positive smoke-free policies.\nWe collected online comments (N = 261) responding to popular media articles on smoking bans in inpatient psychiatry between 2013 and 2014 and conducted an inductive and exploratory qualitative content analysis.\nVerifying previous studies documenting the prevalence of negative commenting, of the comments explicitly supporting or refuting psychiatry smoking bans, there were over twice as many con comments (n = 44) than pro (n = 18). Many commenters argued for access to outdoor smoking areas and warned of patient agitation and risk posed to care workers. Identified content themes included psychiatric medication and negative side effects, broken mental health systems and institutions, denigration of the health risks of tobacco in the context of mental illness, typical pro-smoking arguments about \"smokers' rights\" and alternatives (including e-cigarettes), addiction, and stigma.\nThe current findings provide a platform to begin to understand how people talk about mental health issues and smoking. Our analysis also raised complex issues concerning forces that impact U.S. patients with serious mental illness but over which they have little control, including medication, the U.S. health system, stigma, perceptions that life with chronic serious mental illness is not worth living, and psychological and physical pain of coping with mental illness. In consideration of identified barriers raised in opposition to smoking bans in inpatient psychiatry, efforts should emphasize patient stakeholder involvement; patient, visitor, and staff protection from smoke exposure; the effectiveness of nicotine replacement for managing withdrawal; and the lack of evidence that cigarettes are therapeutic."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric comorbidity and its impact on mortality in patients who attempted suicide by paraquat poisoning during 2000-2010.", "Abstract": "Paraquat poisoning is a lethal method of suicide used around the world.

For this two analyses have been carried out. On the one hand the day mix index of elderly patients (> 64 years) was compared with that of younger ones (> 17 years, < 65 years). On the other hand younger and older were included in the analysis with regard to the available treatment minutes in exact daily classifications according to the PsychPV. It is seen that evaluation of the individual day was markedly higher for gerontopsychiatric patients not only in inpatient (difference > 0.1) but also in outpatient (difference > 0.07) setting. The exact daily classifications according to PsychPV, however, were markedly poorer for the elderly patients. Thus, on the basis of routine data of VIPP projects, a clear change can be seen in favour of the elderly patient under PEPP conditions as compared to financing according to PsychPV. However, concern remains that the ageing population and modernisation of therapy are not being sufficiently taken into account. The new reimbursement system merely regulates the distribution of available resources; if these resources are too low nothing will change by the PEPP-System."}, {"Title": "What is depression? Psychiatrists' and GPs' experiences of diagnosis and the diagnostic process.", "Abstract": "The diagnosis of depression is defined by psychiatrists, and guidelines for treatment of patients with depression are created in psychiatry. However, most patients with depression are treated exclusively in general practice. Psychiatrists point out that general practitioners' (GPs') treatment of depression is insufficient and a collaborative care (CC) model between general practice and psychiatry has been proposed to overcome this. However, for successful implementation, a CC model demands shared agreement about the concept of depression and the diagnostic process in the two sectors. We aimed to explore how depression is understood by GPs and clinical psychiatrists. We carried out qualitative in-depth interviews with 11 psychiatrists and 12 GPs. Analysis was made by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. We found that the two groups of physicians differed considerably in their views on the usefulness of the concept of depression and in their language and narrative styles when telling stories about depressed patients. The differences were captured in three polarities which expressed the range of experiences in the two groups. Psychiatrists considered the diagnosis of depression as a pragmatic and agreed construct and they did not question its validity. GPs thought depression was a \"gray area\" and questioned the clinical utility in general practice. Nevertheless, GPs felt a demand from psychiatry to make their diagnosis based on instruments created in psychiatry, whereas psychiatrists based their diagnosis on clinical impression but used instruments to assess severity. GPs were wholly skeptical about instruments which they felt could be misleading. The different understandings could possibly lead to a clash of interests in any proposed CC model. The findings provide fertile ground for organizational research into the actual implementation of cooperation between sectors to explore how differences are dealt with."}, {"Title": "LAT software induced savings on medical costs of alcohol addicts' care--results from a matched-pairs case-control study.", "Abstract": "Lesch Alcoholism Typology (LAT) is one of the most widely used clinical typologies of alcohol addiction.

Total hospital costs of Psychiatry clinic based non-LAT addicts' care (\u20ac 54,660) were significantly reduced to \u20ac 36,569 after initiation of LAT. Mean total cost per patient was reduced almost by half after initiation of LAT based treatment: \u20ac 331 \u00b1 381 vs. \u20ac 626 \u00b1 795 (LAT/non-LAT; p = 0.001). Mean cost of single psychiatry clinic admission among non-LAT treatment group was \u20ac 320 \u00b1 330 (CI 95% 262-378) and among LAT \u20ac 197 \u00b1 165 (CI 95% 168-226) (p = 0.019). Mean LAT software induced net savings on psychiatric care costs were \u20ac 144 per patient. Total net savings on hospital care including F10 associated somatic co-morbidities amounted to \u20ac 295 per patient. More sensitive diagnostic assessment and sub-type specific pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy following implementation of LAT software lead to significant savings on costs of hospital care."}, {"Title": "Calculating the Social Rhythm Metric (SRM) and Examining Its Use in Interpersonal Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT) in a Healthy Population Study.", "Abstract": "In psychiatry, the social zeitgeber theory argues that social life provides important social cues that entrain circadian rhythms. Disturbance of these social cues might lead do dis-entrainment of circadian rhythms and evoke somatic symptoms that increase the risk of mood disorders. In preventing and treating patients with bipolar disorders, the Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT) relies on the Social Rhythm Metric (SRM) to (re)establish patients' social cues and an re-entrain circadian rhythms. Since the SRM quantifies social rhythms that are derived from a patient's interaction with a social environment, this contribution (a) calculates the SRM of the social environment of a representative healthy population study (n = 1249), (b) evaluates the robustness of the SRM as a quantifier of social rhythms by matching the scores of the pilot study, revealing the near absence of variance across population characteristics and investigation months-circadian rhythms need to be entrained for every month and for everyone-and (c) examines its use in IPSRT by relating high SRM-scores to lower psychological distress (p = 0.004) and low SRM-scores to higher social and emotional dysfunction (p = 0.018)."}, {"Title": "Clinical significance of pharmacogenomic studies in tardive dyskinesia associated with patients with psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Pharmacogenomics is the study of the effects of genetic polymorphisms on medication pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. It offers advantages in predicting drug efficacy and/or toxicity and has already changed clinical practice in many fields of medicine. Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder that rarely remits and poses significant social stigma and physical discomfort for the patient. Pharmacokinetic studies show an association between cytochrome P450 enzyme-determined poor metabolizer status and elevated serum antipsychotic and metabolite levels. However, few prospective studies have shown this to correlate with the occurrence of TD. Many retrospective, case-control and cross-sectional studies have examined the association of cytochrome P450 enzyme, dopamine (receptor, metabolizer and transporter), serotonin (receptor and transporter), and oxidative stress enzyme gene polymorphisms with the occurrence and severity of TD. These studies have produced conflicting and confusing results secondary to heterogeneous inclusion criteria and other patient characteristics that also act as confounding factors. This paper aims to review and summarize the pharmacogenetic findings in antipsychotic-associated TD and assess its clinical significance for psychiatry patients. In addition, we hope to provide insight into areas that need further research."}, {"Title": "Factors associated with adherence to medication among depressed patients from Saudi Arabia: a cross-sectional study.", "Abstract": "Several studies have investigated the factors associated with adherence to antidepressants, with inconsistent conclusions. However, no similar study has investigated this issue among patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder in Saudi Arabia. The aim of this study is to explore patients' adherence to antidepressant medications, and the factors associated with adherence.\nA non-experimental cross-sectional design was used to measure adherence to antidepressants among major depressive disorder patients, and the factors associated with adherence. The patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic at the Al-Amal Complex for Mental Health in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between August 2013 and January 2014. Eligible participants met with one of the research coordinators for assessment of their adherence. Adherence was investigated indirectly by use of the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, and patients' beliefs were assessed through the Beliefs about Medicine Questionnaire. Information about the severity of their depression, demographics, and other study variables were collected.\nA total of 403 patients met the inclusion criteria and participated in the study. Of those, 203 (50.37%) were females, while the remaining 200 (49.6%) were males. There was an average age of 39 years (standard deviation, \u00b111 years). Half of the patients (52.9%) reported low adherence to their antidepressant medication, with statistically significant differences between the low adherence and high adherence scores relating to sex, age, and duration of illness.\nLow medication adherence is a common problem among major depressive disorder patients in Saudi Arabia. Medication-taking behavior among depressed patients is influenced by several factors, mainly patients' beliefs regarding antidepressants. This study has improved the understanding of the factors associated with adherence to antidepressants."}, {"Title": "Critical issues on the use of network meta-analysis in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The need to support clinical decision making and cost-effectiveness analyses in medicine, despite a dearth of head-to-head treatment comparisons, has encouraged the development of methods enabling indirect comparisons of treatment alternatives, including network meta-analysis (NMA). Valid application of NMA requires close similarity of compared trials, including their design, patient characteristics, and methods of diagnosis and symptomatic assessment. When biological or other objective measures of outcomes are not available, as is the case in psychiatric disorders, subtle differences in characteristics of trials or participants may lead to unrecognized incoherence within a network and thus to inconsistent results. By considering comparative-efficacy analyses of psychotropic drugs in major psychiatric disorders as working examples, we underscore the risks of violating the fundamental transitivity assumption in the context of NMA and suggest precautions for creating a coherent network. We conclude that with thoughtful and critical application, NMA can add useful information concerning the comparative benefits, risks, and costs of specific treatments in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Circadian rhythm sleep disorders in psychiatric diseases].", "Abstract": "Circadian rhythm sleep disorders are prevalent among psychiatric patients. This is most probable due to a close relationship between functional disturbances of the internal clock, sleep regulation and mental health. Mechanisms on molecular level of the circadian clock and neurotransmitter signalling are involved in the development of both disorders. Moreover, circadian disorders and psychiatric diseases favour each other by accessory symptoms such as stress or social isolation. Actimetry to objectively quantify the rest-activity cycle and salivary melatonin profiles as marker for the circadian phase help to diagnose circadian rhythm sleep disorders in psychiatric patients. Chronotherapeutics such as bright light therapy, dark therapy, melatonin administration, and wake therapy are used to synchronise and consolidate circadian rhythms and help in the treatment of depression and other psychiatric disorders, but are still neglected in medicine. More molecular to behavioural research is needed for the understanding of the development of circadian disorders and their relationship to psychiatric illnesses. This will help to boost the awareness and treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Pretreatment With Caffeine Citrate to Increase Seizure Duration During Electroconvulsive Therapy: A Case Series.", "Abstract": "Due to the shortage of parenteral caffeine and sodium benzoate, patients were pretreated with caffeine citrate to increase therapeutic seizure duration during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). To date, no data are available on the use of caffeine citrate during ECT. This retrospective case series was done to demonstrate utilization of caffeine citrate as a substitute for caffeine and sodium benzoate in optimizing ECT.\nMedical records were reviewed to identify patients who received ECT and caffeine citrate. Physician notes were reviewed to determine the parameters of the ECT procedure, the seizure length, and the dose of caffeine citrate. Each chart was thoroughly studied to find the relationship between seizure duration and dose of caffeine citrate.\nOf the 12 ECT treatments utilizing caffeine citrate, 9 achieved at least 1 session lasting >30 seconds with an average seizure duration of 35 seconds. Increase in seizure duration ranged from -41% to 276% with an average increase of 48%. Only 3 treatment sessions utilizing caffeine citrate showed no increase in seizure duration. Doses ranged from 120 to 600 mg of both oral and parenteral caffeine citrate. Although increase in seizure duration was achieved for the majority of the ECT sessions, no dose-response correlation could be made. No significant adverse reactions were noted with the use of caffeine citrate during ECT.\nIt was determined that, much like caffeine and sodium benzoate, caffeine citrate does increase the seizure duration. However, this response did vary due to many reasons including small sample size, concomitant medications, duration of illness, and number of ECTs they received in the past and how long ago they received the last ECT. Further research is required to elucidate the effect of these variables on seizure duration."}, {"Title": "Person-centred care: clarifying the concept in the context of inpatient psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This paper reports an analysis of the concept of person-centred care in the context of inpatient psychiatry. It has been suggested that person-centred care in inpatient psychiatry might differ from person-centred care in other contexts, indicating a need to clarify the concept in this specific context. Scholarly papers from health-related disciplines were identified following a systematic search of the electronic databases CINAHL, PUBMED and PsycINFO, covering records indexed up until March 2014. An evolutionary approach to concept analysis was applied, integrating principles for data extraction and analysis in integrative reviews. The concept of person-centred care was defined as cultural, relational and recovery-oriented. It aspires to improve care and calls for a transformation of inpatient psychiatry. The concept is closely related to the concepts of recovery and interpersonal nursing. The result is described in terms of attributes, antecedents, consequences and related concepts. It is concluded that the further development of the concept needs to consider the contexts of the concept at both conceptual and praxis levels. Further research should explore the nature of and relationships between context, culture, care practice and outcomes in inpatient psychiatry from a perspective of person-centred care. The results of this analysis can provide a framework for such research."}, {"Title": "Use and diversion of medical marijuana among adults admitted to inpatient psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Marijuana use is associated with anxiety, depressive, psychotic, neurocognitive, and substance use disorders.

Pharmacogenetic tests, such as GeneSight Psychotropic and the Genecept Assay, are being marketed directly to patients and prescribers despite a relative lack of evidence to support their clinical validity or utility. Pharmacogenetic testing is potentially useful in certain clinical situations, but its usefulness will depend on the knowledge base of the prescriber to be able to interpret the findings for a particular patient.

We collected information about their knowledge of English and the ways in which they wrote their articles to be submitted to periodicals published in English. Multiple regression analyses were carried out in order to investigate the influence English proficiency, h-index of supervisors and use of language editing assistance had on the number and impact of student publications.\nAlthough 60% of students scored \u226580 (out of 100) on English tests given at admission to the graduate program, 93.09% of the sample used some form of external editing assistance to produce their papers in English. The variables \"number of publications\" and \"impact factor of journals\" were significantly related to each other (r\u2009=\u20090.550, p\u2009<\u20090.001).

The current study ventures to advance the hypothesis that part of this uncertainty is due to the fact that during the scientific area in its history (approx. 1850-1960) medical psychology abandoned its historical core competence as it emerged and developed during the age of enlightenment (end of 17(th)-18(th) centuries). To make this change clear, different examples of the 2 opposing conceptualisations of medical psychology are discussed, of course in a selected and maybe even provocative way. The change in concept also led to the fact that the interrelationships with and differentiation from its neighbouring disciplines are not clear and sharp either, since at times 2 or more disciplines declare themselves competent for one and the same thing. This is exemplified on the manifold overlappings with clinical psychology. Given the lack of resources now and in the future, this lack of a clear definition of competence might lead to continued uncertainty as well as to conflicts over distribution. On the other hand though, the look into the history of the subject reveals that at all times it has been a matter of individual approach or attitude as to what was regarded as core area of interest and competence of medical psychology and how far it overlapped with neighbouring disciplines. From the point of view of the history of psychiatry and on the basis of carefully selected historic material, this paper presents the core of 2 different concepts of medical psychology to elaborate this hypothesis."}, {"Title": "Mervyn Susser and community psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Mervyn Susser's contributions to community psychiatry from 1957-1968 comprised a creative and significant phase of his career, though less well known than his other work.

The data collected included sociodemographic information, clinical characteristics, care characteristics, and the SATISPSY-22. A multivariate analysis using multiple linear regressions was performed to determine the variables potentially associated with satisfaction levels.\nTwo hundred seventy patients were enrolled in our study. Only one moderate association was found between satisfaction and sociodemographic characteristics: the personal experience dimension with age (\u03b2=0.15). Clinical improvement was moderately associated with higher global satisfaction (\u03b2=-0.15), higher satisfaction with quality of care (\u03b2=-0.19), and higher satisfaction with food (\u03b2=-0.18). Stronger associations with satisfaction were found for care characteristics, particularly the therapeutic alliance with all of the satisfaction dimensions (\u03b2, 0.20-0.43) except food, and for seclusion with global satisfaction (\u03b2=-0.33) and personal experience (\u03b2=-0.32). Patients with previous hospitalization also had a higher level of satisfaction with quality of care compared with patients who were admitted for the first time (\u03b2=-0.15).\nThis study has identified a number of potential determinants of satisfaction. The therapeutic relationship and seclusion were the most important features associated with a patient's satisfaction. These factors might be amenable through intervention, which, in turn, might be expected to improve satisfaction, patients' management, and health outcomes in psychiatric hospitals."}, {"Title": "Pseudologia fantastica \u00e0 deux: review and case study.", "Abstract": "While lying is a diachronic integral part of human interaction, pseudologia fantastica represents probably its psychopathological dimension. There are relatively few reported cases on psychological mechanisms of pathological lying and also on criteria concerning psychopathological development on a ground of lying. A review of literature on possible psychological mechanisms of pseudologia fantastica is presented. Psychopathological qualities are rather controversial, especially whether pathological lying is a conscious act or not. DSM IV-TR recognizes pseudologia fantastica in association with factitious disorder but not as a clinical entity. Diagnostic issues are raised regarding lying, deception, pseudology and its shared dimension. Cases of shared pseudology are rarely reported in literature. Related shared psychopathological phenomena such as pseudologia \u00e0 deux, folie \u00e0 deux and mass hysteria are equally examined and compared under the prism of 'mental infection'. Cases of pseudologia fantastica are poorly understood or underecognized and clinicians usually pay minor attention in its psychopathological significance. It remains doubtful, whether pathological lying should be considered as an autonomous clinical entity. The need for research both on phenomenology and pathophysiology is emphasized. In addition to reviewing literature, we also report a case of pseudology \u00e0 deux in a couple, a female and a male patient. Presented psychopathological manifestations, personality characteristics, psychological and social factors concerning both patients are considered, aiming to determine a sufficient phenomenological analysis. The diagnoses of pseudologia fantastica and folie \u00e0 deux are discussed and documented. A second axis diagnosis of personality disorder and other diagnostic issues are also considered. A favorable issue of this case, within a follow up of one year, is due to the therapeutic and social potential of a community psychiatry's setting, offering an individual follow up to both partners and a family approach including the ex husband of the female patient and her two minor children.

At the same time, over recent years in experiments in vitro and in vivo a plethora of evidence has accumulated on a positive effect of lithium ions in other areas including their neuro-, cardio-, and nephroprotective properties, regulation of stem cells functions, regulation of inflammation, and others. Numerous studies have shown that the effect of lithium ions involves several mechanisms; however, one of its main targets in the implementation of most of the effects is glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2, a key enzyme in various pathological and protective signaling pathways in cells. However, one of the main limitations of the use of lithium salts in clinics is their narrow therapeutic window, and the risk of toxic side effects. This review presents the diversity of effects of lithium ions on the organism emphasizing their potential clinical applications with minimal undesirable side effects.

Among the most critical of these processes are epigenetic mechanisms, which serve to link the cellular environment with genomic material. Until recently our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms has been limited by the lack of tools that can selectively manipulate the epigenome with genetic, cellular, and temporal precision, which in turn diminishes the potential impact of epigenetic processes as therapeutic targets. This review highlights an emerging suite of tools that enable robust yet selective interrogation of the epigenome. In addition to allowing site-specific epigenetic editing, these tools can be paired with optogenetic approaches to provide temporal control over epigenetic processes, allowing unparalleled insight into the function of these mechanisms. This improved control promises to revolutionize our understanding of epigenetic modifications in human health and disease states."}, {"Title": "Epigenetic advances in clinical neuroscience.", "Abstract": "Epigenetics, broadly defined as the regulation of gene expression without alteration of the genome, has become a field of tremendous interest in neuroscience, neurology, and psychiatry.

A second challenge concerns the conceptualization of a new classification system for mental health problems. Adopting a classification system that integrates new insights from socio-neurobiology and from a networks perspective could bring cultural psychiatry and global mental health closer and change the way each field addresses the mental health gap, which constitutes the third challenge. I summarize attempts to achieve comprehensive mental health coverage around the globe and question whether the strategies employed to achieve these goals have been successful, both in high- (HIC) and low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).

The intervention programme consists of individualised psycho-education focusing on behaviours prior to illness-related crisis, crisis cards and, after discharge from the psychiatric hospital, a 24-month preventive monitoring. In total, 238 (of 756 approached) inpatients were included in the trial. After 12 months, 80 (67.2%) in the intervention group and 102 (85.7%) in the TAU group were still participating in the trial. Of these, 22.5% in the intervention group (35.3% TAU) had been compulsorily readmitted to psychiatry; results suggest a significantly lower number of compulsory readmissions per patient (0.3 intervention; 0.7 TAU). Dropouts are characterised by younger age and unemployment.

It has a unique receptor profile and it is licensed in the UK for the treatment of bipolar-affective disorder. However, there is some evidence for its effectiveness in schizophrenia and it is licensed for schizophrenia treatment in a number of countries. Significant numbers of patients within the high-secure hospital setting suffer from treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Many patients fail to respond to adequate antipsychotic trials, and require trials of augmentation with other medications.\nWe report on our experience of using asenapine for augmentation of other antipsychotic medications in two male patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and histories of interpersonal violence. The patients provided informed consent to participate in this case series. Data were collected from the patients' clinical records, incident reports and hospital medical centre records. These records were used to derive primary and secondary outcome measures. These included time spent in seclusion, verbal and physical aggression, numbers of incidents and metabolic parameters. Symptoms were rated pre- and postaugmentation using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impression rating scales.\nBoth patients showed an improvement after the addition of asenapine. These improvements were characterized by a reduction in global PANSS scores, in the PANSS excitability component, a reduction in scores of violence, overall incidents and reduction in seclusion hours.\nWe found asenapine to be an effective augmentation agent with other antipsychotics in both patients. Clinical improvement was noted within weeks. The case-series nature and small sample size limited our ability to draw firm conclusions from our data. However, retrospective analysis has allowed us to take a naturalistic approach that this augmentation strategy may be advantageous on an individual patient basis in a high-secure hospital setting."}, {"Title": "Video-confidence: a qualitative exploration of videoconferencing for psychiatric emergencies.", "Abstract": "In psychiatric emergencies in rural areas the availability of psychiatrists are limited. Therefore, tele-psychiatry, via real-time videoconferencing (VC), has been developed to provide advanced consultative services to areas that lack psychiatrists. However, there is limited research on the use of VC for psychiatric emergencies. The University Hospital of North Norway has been the first hospital in Norway to implement this type of service by developing a new on-call system for psychiatric emergency practice through which psychiatrists are accessible by telephone and VC 24 hours a day for consultations with patients and nurses at three regional psychiatric centres. This study explores patients', psychiatrists' and nurses' experiences of using VC for psychiatric emergencies, as well as how the technology influenced their confidence.\nIn this study, we used a qualitative explorative research design. With a particular focus on users' experiences of VC, we conducted 29 semi-structured interviews with patients, psychiatrists and nurses who had participated in a VC consultation in at least one psychiatric emergency.\nOur findings show that access to the VC system increased the experience of confidence in challenging psychiatric emergencies in four ways: (1) by strengthening patient involvement during the psychiatric specialist's assessment, (2) by reducing uncertainty, (3) by sharing responsibility for decisions and (4) by functioning as a safety net even when VC was not used.\nThis study has demonstrated that an emergency psychiatric service delivered by VC may improve the confidence of psychiatrists, nurses and patients in challenging psychiatric emergencies. VC can serve as an effective tool for ensuring decentralised high-quality psychiatric services for emergency care."}, {"Title": "Agreement between referral information and discharge diagnoses according to Norwegian elective treatment guidelines - a cross-sectional study.", "Abstract": "Norway introduced 32 priority guidelines for elective health treatment in the specialist health service in the period 2008-9. The guidelines were intended to reduce large differences in waiting times among hospitals, streamline referrals and ensure that patients accessed the necessary healthcare to which they were entitled for certain conditions. Referral information guided the priorities. As the referral information was key to future evaluation of the guidelines, this study validates the referral information in hospital patient records against discharge diagnoses, because only the discharge diagnosis is recorded in the Norwegian Patient Register (NPR) database, which is used in the main evaluation.\nOf the specific conditions from 10 priority guidelines, 20 were selected for review for the period 2008-9 at 4 hospitals in Norway. The ICD-10 diagnoses per disease or condition were given in retrospect by clinicians who participated in the expert groups developing the priority guidelines. Reasons for deviations between referral information and discharge diagnoses were coded into four categories, according to the degree of precision of the former compared with the latter.\nIn all, 1854 medical records were available for review. The diagnostic precision of the referrals differed significantly between hospitals, and across the 2 years 2008 and 2009. The overall sensitivity was 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.92-0.94). For the separate conditions, sensitivity was in the range 0.60-1.00. Experience showed that it was necessary to pay careful attention to the selection of ICD-10 diagnoses for identifying patients. The medical records of psychiatry patients were unavailable in some cases and for certain conditions some were unavailable after use of our record extraction algorithm.\nThe sensitivity of the referral information on diagnosis or condition was high compared with the discharge diagnosis for the 20 selected conditions from the 10 priority guidelines. Although the review assessed a limited number of the total, we consider the results sufficiently representative and, hence, they will allow use of the NPR data for analyses of the introduction and follow-up of the 32 priority guidelines."}, {"Title": "Improving patient care for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children by organizational redesign (Tornado program) and enhanced collaboration between psychiatry and general practice: a controlled before and after study.", "Abstract": "Implementation of clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents is a challenge in practice due to insufficient availability of mental health specialists and lack of effective cooperation with primary care physicians.

Following unsuccessful attempts at legal recourse, Kohlhaas takes up arms against the authorities, and in the course of his uncompromising pursuit of justice eventually sacrifices his own and his family's lives. Kleist accurately portrays Kohlhaas' psychopathological development from a psychologically balanced, emotionally warm family man to one who causes utter destruction, mayhem and the loss of innocent lives. This literary work is a remarkably authentic, insightful and rich representation of litigious/querulant behaviour, described by classical authors as litigious paranoia, a diagnostic category currently subsumed under 'delusional disorder, persecutory type', in DSM-5 and 'persistent delusional disorder' in ICD-10.\nKleist's novella offers important clues to better understand the development of litigious-querulant behaviour and the inner world of its sufferers. An analysis of the novella also illustrates the contribution that fiction could make to resuscitate the narrative as a complement to criterion-based diagnostic practice prevailing in contemporary psychiatry. \u00a9 2014 S.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) technology is the preferred tool in the current wave of clinical experiments because it allows clinicians to directly alter the functions of targeted brain regions, in a reversible manner, with the intent of correcting diseases of the mind, such as depression, addiction, anorexia nervosa, dementia, and obsessive compulsive disorder. These promising treatments raise a critical philosophical and humanitarian question. \"Under what conditions does 'altering brain function' qualify as 'mind control'?\" In order to answer this question one needs a definition of mind control. To this end, we reviewed the relevant philosophical, ethical, and neurosurgical literature in order to create a set of criteria for what constitutes mind control in the context of DBS. We also outline clinical implications of these criteria. Finally, we demonstrate the relevance of the proposed criteria by focusing especially on serendipitous treatments involving DBS, i.e., cases in which an unintended therapeutic benefit occurred. These cases highlight the importance of gaining the consent of the subject for the new therapy in order to avoid committing an act of mind control."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric Nurses' Perceptions about Physical Restraint; A Qualitative Study.", "Abstract": "The use of physical restraint as an intervention in the care of psychiatric patients dates back to the beginning of psychiatry.

Mental health laws in high-income countries typically permit coercive treatment of persons with mental disorders to restore health or prevent future harm. Criteria intended to regulate practice leave scope for discretion. The values and beliefs of staff may become a determinating factor for decisions. Previous research has only to a limited degree addressed how legal criteria for involuntary psychiatric admission are interpreted by clinical decision-makers. We examined clinicians' interpretations of criteria for involuntary admission under the Norwegian Mental Health Care Act. This act applies a status approach, whereby involuntary admission can be used at the presence of mental disorder and need for treatment or perceived risk to the patient or others. Further, best interest assessments carry a large justificatory burden and open for a range of extra-legislative factors to be considered.\nDeductive thematic analysis was used. Three ideal types of attitudes-to-coercion were developed, denoted paternalistic, deliberative and interpretive. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 10 Norwegian clinicians with experience from admissions to psychiatric care were carried out. Data was fit into the preconceived analytical frame. We hypothesised that the data would mirror the recent shift from paternalism towards a more human rights focused approach in modern mental health care.\nThe paternalistic perspective was, however, clearly expressed in the data. Involuntary admission was considered to be in the patient's best interest, and patients suffering from serious mental disorder were assumed to lack decision-making capacity. In addition to assessment of need, outcome effectiveness and risk of harm, extra-legislative factors such as patients' functioning, experience, resistance, networks, and follow-up options were told to influence decisions. Variation in how these multiple factors were taken into consideration was found. Some of the participants' statements could be attributed to the deliberative perspective, most of which concerned participants' beliefs about an ideal decision-making situation.\nOur data suggest how a deliberative-oriented ideal of reasoning about legal criteria for involuntary admission lapses into paternalism in clinical decision-making.

A common theme across countries is the uncertainty surrounding who should act as gatekeeper for physical health matters in psychiatry. Much of the metabolic monitoring is carried out by psychiatrists who often feel ill equipped to treat medical problems such as abnormal cholesterol or disturbances of glucose metabolism. However many patients do not attend primary care on a regular basis and may not be likely to follow through on referral to primary care.

The first effective spinal injury units were established by Wilhelm Wagner in K\u00f6nigsh\u00fctte, Silesia and Emil Kocher in Bern, Switzerland at the end of the 19th century.\nThe modern principles of spinal injury treatment emanated from the work carried out by Wagner and Kocher. This knowledge was applied during the First World War in Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Marburg established a unit in Vienna, Dr. and Mrs. D\u00e9jerine and their team of French doctors treated casualties from the First World War and, in the United Kingdom, Gordon Holmes, George Riddoch and Henry Head treated soldiers suffering from spinal injuries in specialised units. After the war these units closed down, doctors went back to their previous occupations and the expertise gained was lost or, in the case of Germany, suppressed. It was only in 1939 when Ludwig Guttmann, a Jewish refugee, arrived in the United Kingdom that this specialised knowledge was used to set up satisfactory treatment.\nMany of the key principles of treatment for spinal injuries were developed at the end of the 19th century and during the First World War but units closed down and the knowledge gained was forgotten. With the advent of the Second World War, German refugees, many of whom had worked in the field of neurology (including Ludwig Guttmann), came to the United Kingdom armed with a thorough training in neurology and rehabilitation and applied these principles to the treatment of spinal injuries for the benefit of the country which gave them refuge."}, {"Title": "The importance of social support for women with elevated anxiety undergoing care for gynecologic malignancies.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to screen for depression and anxiety and to assess well-being among women diagnosed with gynecologic malignancies, identify factors associated with elevated depressive or anxiety symptoms, and further characterize the needs of those with elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms.\nWomen presenting for gynecologic cancer at an academic center during the course of 10 months were offered screening for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Patients were screened with the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders' Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General assessed well-being. Demographics, psychiatric history, and components about the cancer and treatment were collected. Those who screened positive with scores of 10 or higher on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 or the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 were offered a meeting with the study psychiatrist for further evaluation both with the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis as well as with an interview to discuss their experiences and to assess their desired needs.\nWhen family and social well-being was added to the logistic regression model, higher family and social well-being was the strongest factor associated with lower amounts of anxiety (odds ratio, 0.10; P = 0.001 for a cutoff of 10; odds ratio, 0.21; P = 0.012 for a cutoff of 8). Less than 30% who screened positive met with the study psychiatrist and were not receiving optimal treatment.\nGiven that low family and social well-being and elevated anxiety symptoms were so highly correlated, those with anxiety symptoms would most benefit from social interventions. However, this study also found that patients with elevated depressive or anxiety symptoms were difficult to engage with a psychiatric provider. We need partnership between psychiatry and gynecology oncology to identify those with elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms and develop better ways to provide psychosocial supports."}, {"Title": "When father doesn't know best: selective disagreement between self-report and informant report of the broad autism phenotype in parents of a child with autism.", "Abstract": "The Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) is a reliable tool for identifying three autism-related traits-social aloofness, pragmatic language abnormalities and rigid personality--within families of a person with autism and the general population. Although little is known concerning agreement between self-report and informant report versions of the BAPQ, identifying individual characteristics affecting agreement between the two can highlight important considerations for maximizing its yield, particularly when only one version is administered. Here, analysis of self-report and informant report of the BAPQ completed by 444 parents of a child with autism revealed moderate to strong agreement between the two versions for all three broad autism phenotype (BAP) traits when the self-reporting parent did not possess the trait being assessed. In contrast, disagreement selectively occurred when the assessed parent was positive for the BAP trait being rated. This pattern was driven primarily by fathers who were positive for a BAP trait endorsing lower levels of that trait relative to informant report. This discrepancy did not occur for mothers, nor did it occur for fathers lacking BAP traits. Because this pattern was specific to fathers positive for BAP traits, it likely reflects selective \"blind spots\" in their self-reporting and not poorer self-reporting by fathers more broadly, nor a general tendency of overreporting by informant mothers. The presence of BAP traits in informing parents, however, largely did not reduce agreement between self-report and informant report. In sum, self-report may underestimate the presence of BAP traits in fathers but is generally consistent with informant report for mothers."}, {"Title": "Operationalizing Cognitive Science and Technologies' Research and Development; the \"Brain and Cognition Study Group (BCSG)\" Initiative from Shiraz, Iran.", "Abstract": "Recent advances in brain and cognitive science studies have revolutionized concepts in neural dynamics, regulating mechanisms, coding systems and information processing networks which govern our function and behavior.

In 2007, the European Parliament introduced Regulation 1901/2006 concerning medicinal products in pediatric populations, with a subsequent amendment in the form of Regulation 1902/2006. The main aim of this legislation was to encourage research and clinical trials in children and adolescents, and thus promote the availability of medications with marketing authorization for these age groups. Furthermore, initiatives such as the European 7th Framework Program of the European Union now offer substantial funding for pediatric pharmacological research. At a recent Congress of the German Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (DGKJP), experts from the field and the pharmaceutical industry held a symposium with lay representatives in order to discuss attitudes toward, and experience with, pediatric psychopharmacology research in Germany since 2007. Several areas of concern were identified. The present paper derives from that symposium and provides an overview of these opinions, which remain crucial to the field.

Our study aimed to investigate this issue.\nPsychiatrists working in palliative care in Australia were individually interviewed using a semistructured approach. Nine participants were interviewed to reach data saturation. Interview transcripts were analyzed for themes.\nThree overarching themes were identified: (1) depression means different things; (2) depression is conceptualized using different models; and (3) depression is the same concept within and outside of the palliative care setting. Participants explicitly articulated the heterogeneous nature of depression and described a different breadths of concepts, ranging from a narrow construct of a depressive illness to a broader one that encompassed depressive symptoms and emotions. However, depressive illness was a consistent concept, and participants considered this in terms of phenotypic subtypes. Participants used three models (spectral, dichotomous, and mixed) to relate various depressive presentations.\nPsychiatrists did not subscribe to a unitary model of depression but understood it as a heterogeneous concept comprised of depressive illness and other less clearly defined depressive presentations.

The CSF-NDD also provides a predictive diagnosis of incipient AD for high-risk patients when they are still in the prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) but as no (secondary) preventive therapy of AD is currently available, the use of CSF-NDD for the predictive molecular diagnosis of AD is not recommended in the neuropsychiatry guidelines (http://www.DGPPN.de). However, molecular diagnostics of preclinical AD by CSF-NDD and/or [18F]-amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) has meanwhile gained high clinical relevance for therapeutic clinical research, as this novel clinical model allows systematic screening for promising (secondary) preventive therapy options. Moreover, it has now become apparent that blood-based neurochemical diagnostics of preclinical and early AD will be possible by means of various formats of multiplex assays.

Our aim was to determine predictors of hospital length of stay (LOS) for geriatric patients with dementia admitted to inpatient psychiatric beds. Methods: Admission and discharge data from a large urban mental health center, from 2005 to 2010 inclusive, were retrospectively analyzed. Using the resident assessment instrument - mental health (RAI-MH), an assessment that is used to collect demographic and clinical information within 72 hours of hospital admission, 169 geriatric patients with dementia were compared with 308 geriatric patients without dementia. Predictors of hospital LOS were determined using a series of general linear models. Results: A diagnosis of dementia did not predict a longer LOS in this geriatric psychiatry inpatient population. The presence of multiple medical co-morbidities had an inverse relationship to length of hospital LOS - a greater number of co-morbidities predicted a shorter hospital LOS in the group of geriatric patients who had dementia compared to the without dementia study group. The presence of incapacity and positive psychotic symptoms predicted longer hospital LOS, irrespective of admission group (patients with dementia compared with those without). Conversely, pain on admission predicted shorter hospital LOS. Conclusions: Specific clinical characteristics generally determined at the time of admission are predictive of hospital LOS in geriatric psychiatry inpatients. Addressing these factors early on during admission and in the community may result in shorter hospital LOS and more optimal use of resources."}, {"Title": "Prevalence and Correlates of Missed First Appointments among Outpatients at a Psychiatric Hospital in Nigeria.", "Abstract": "Missed appointments are common in psychiatric practice.

There are several known modifications to histones, including methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation, and a range of factors influence each of these. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove the acetyl group from lysine residues within a range of proteins, including transcription factors and histones. Whilst this means that their influence on cellular processes is more complex and far-reaching than histone modifications alone, their predominant function appears to relate to histones; through deacetylation of lysine residues they can influence expression of genes encoded by DNA linked to the histone molecule. HDAC inhibitors in turn regulate the activity of HDACs, and have been widely used as therapeutics in psychiatry and neurology, in which a number of adverse outcomes are associated with aberrant HDAC function. More recently, dietary HDAC inhibitors have been shown to have a regulatory effect similar to that of pharmacological HDAC inhibitors without the possible side-effects. Here, we discuss a number of dietary HDAC inhibitors, and how they may have therapeutic potential in the context of a whole food."}, {"Title": "Towards indicated prevention of psychosis: using probabilistic assessments of transition risk in psychosis prodrome.", "Abstract": "The concept of indicated prevention has proliferated in psychiatry, and accumulating evidence suggests that it may indeed be possible to prevent or delay the onset of a first episode of psychosis though adequate interventions in individuals deemed at clinical high risk (CHR) for such an event. One challenge undermining these efforts is the relatively poor predictive accuracy of clinical assessments used in practice for CHR individuals, often leading to diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty reflected in clinical guidelines promoting a 'watch and wait' approach to CHR patients. Using data from published studies, and employing predictive models based on the odds-ratio form of Bayes' rule, we simulated scenarios where clinical interview, neurocognitive testing, structural magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiology are part of the initial assessment process of a CHR individual (extended diagnostic approach). Our findings indicate that for most at-risk patients, at least three of these assessments are necessary to arrive at a clinically meaningful differentiation into high- intermediate-, and low-risk groups. In particular, patients with equivocal results in the initial assessments require additional diagnostic testing to produce an accurate risk profile forming part of the comprehensive initial assessment. The findings may inform future research into reliable identification and personalized therapeutic targeting of CHR patients, to prevent transition to full-blown psychosis."}, {"Title": "Methodology of development and students' perceptions of a psychiatry educational smartphone application.", "Abstract": "The usage of Smartphones and smartphone applications in the recent decade has indeed become more prevalent.

It describes the characteristics, critiques, and roots of positive psychology and positive psychotherapy, and summarises the existing evidence on positive psychotherapy. Positive psychology aims to refocus psychological research and practice on the positive aspects of experience, strengths, and resources. Despite a number of conceptual and applied research challenges, the field has rapidly developed since its introduction at the turn of the century. Today positive psychology serves as an umbrella term to accommodate research investigating positive emotions and other positive aspects such as creativity, optimism, resilience, empathy, compassion, humour, and life satisfaction. Positive psychotherapy is a therapeutic intervention that evolved from this research. It shows promising results for reducing depression and increasing well-being in healthy people and those with depression. Positive psychology and positive psychotherapy are increasingly being applied in mental health settings, but research evidence involving people with severe mental illness is still scarce. The focus on strengths and resources in positive psychology and positive psychotherapy may be a promising way to support recovery in people with mental illness, such as depression, substance abuse disorders, and psychosis.

Systems medicine, which is the emerging application of systems biology to medicine and a merger of molecular biomedicine, systems theory and mathematical modelling, has recently been proposed as a primary care-centered strategy for medicine that promises to meet these challenges. Significantly, it has been proposed to do so in a way that at first glance may seem compatible with humanistic medicine. More specifically, it is promoted as an integrative, holistic, personalized and patient-centered approach. In this article, we ask whether and to what extent systems medicine can provide a comprehensive conceptual account of and approach to the patient and the root causes of health problems that can be reconciled with the concept of the patient as a person, which is an essential theoretical element in humanistic medicine.\nWe answer this question through a comparative analysis of the theories of primary care doctor Eric Cassell and systems biologist Denis Noble.\nWe argue that, although systems biological concepts, notably Noble's theory of biological relativity and downward causation, are highly relevant for understanding human beings and health problems, they are nevertheless insufficient in fully bridging the gap to humanistic medicine. Systems biologists are currently unable to conceptualize living wholes, and seem unable to account for meaning, value and symbolic interaction, which are central concepts in humanistic medicine, as constraints on human health. Accordingly, systems medicine as currently envisioned cannot be said to be integrative, holistic, personalized or patient-centered in a humanistic medical sense."}, {"Title": "The effect of most important medicinal plants on two importnt psychiatric disorders (anxiety and depression)-a review.", "Abstract": "Anxiety and depression are highly comorbid psychiatric conditions that the prevalence will be increased to the second greatest risk of morbidity, causing a significant socioeconomic burden.

Earlier work has supported the idea that there may be a relationship between the use of certain media and depression. In this study, we tested if self-report of depression (SRD), which is not a clinically based diagnosis, was associated with increased internet, television, and social media usage by using data collected in the Media Behavior and Influence Study (MBIS) database (N = 19,776 subjects). We further assessed the relationship of demographic variables to this association. These analyses found that SRD rates were in the range of published rates of clinically diagnosed major depression. It found that those who tended to use more media also tended to be more depressed, and that segmentation of SRD subjects was weighted toward internet and television usage, which was not the case with non-SRD subjects, who were segmented along social media use. This study found that those who have suffered either economic or physical life setbacks are orders of magnitude more likely to be depressed, even without disproportionately high levels of media use. However, among those that have suffered major life setbacks, high media users-particularly television watchers-were even more likely to report experiencing depression, which suggests that these effects were not just due to individuals having more time for media consumption.

As a result, other authorities are making this shift, circumventing the DSM in the process. For example, through the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), NIMH now encourages investigators to focus on a dimensional and neuroscientific conceptualization of mental disorder research. Fortunately, the DSM-5 contains a dimensional model of maladaptive personality traits that provides clinical descriptors that align conceptually with the neuroscience-based dimensions delineated in the RDoC and in basic science research.

In the emergency situation, it is important to look for an underlying somatic disorder. Although no specific treatment exists, there is a consensus in favor of a positive role of psychotherapy. First of all, the main problem is to explain to patients that their physical complaint has a psychological cause. In order to deliver the diagnosis in the most appropriate and useful manner, physicians have to first convince themselves before trying to convince patients. Combined consultation (medicine and psychiatry) is a useful tool to help patients.

I would advocate an alternative interpretation of the truth status of diagnostic classifications that leads to different conclusions. This is based firstly on Karl Popper's ideas on the growth of knowledge, whereby hypotheses developed from theoretical conjectures are deliberately subjected to attempts at refutation (we refine our always provisional views of what is true by increasing our knowledge of what is false). My second source of argument is John Wing's view that diseases are theoretical constructs on which disease theories may be based and tested. Such theories relate variously to aetiology, pathology, treatment, course and outcome. Rejecting a disease theory does not force rejection of the disease construct it seeks to qualify. We adhere to disease constructs more strongly than to the disease theories based on them. However, if it becomes apparent that the information obtained by testing disease theories is incoherent, we may eventually jettison particular disease constructs, as has happened regularly in the history of medicine. The disease constructs used in psychiatry may be approaching this point."}, {"Title": "How we developed a trainee-led book group as a supplementary education tool for psychiatric training in the 21st century.", "Abstract": "Postgraduate medical education has, in recent years, become a dynamic field with the increasing availability of innovative and interactive teaching techniques. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the current focus of psychiatric training on the acquisition of scientific and clinical knowledge is inadequate to address the multidimensional nature of psychiatry. Supplementary teaching tools may be usefully applied to address this need.\nA group of trainees at the Maudsley Hospital and Institute of Psychiatry (UK) pioneered the use of a book group as an innovative teaching tool to enhance the psychiatric training experience by, amongst other aspects, facilitating dialogue between peers on fundamental epistemological issues raised by critical engagement with seminal psychiatric texts.\nFeedback from members suggested that participation in the book group broadened the overall learning potential and experience of psychiatry. The key ingredients were identified as: (i) collaborative peer-to-peer learning; (ii) the use of 'flipped classroom' model; and (iii) joint ownership.\nThe book group has demonstrated real potential to facilitate direct trainee engagement with the multi-faceted nature of psychiatry as a complex humanistic discipline within an informal learning space."}, {"Title": "[Depression post stroke in Africa: myth or reality?].", "Abstract": "Depression is a complication occurring frequently after a stroke.

On one hundred five subjects included, thirty five were stroke victims matched with seventy witnesses. The prevalence of post stroke depression was 88.6% (31/35) versus (20/70) 28.5% in controls (p <0.001). This post stroke depression occurred in 58% of men with a sex ratio of 1.4. The mean age of subjects with post stroke depression was 49.1 years, with extremes ranging from 33 to 76 years of age. Most (64.5%) subjects with post stroke depression was no occupation; 71.5% of them had a stroke dating back more than six weeks, and 92% had a motor deficit with a Barthel Index <100. Subjects with stroke suffered mostly moderate depression (48.1%) whereas the controls usually had mild depression (80.4%). This depression was not correlated with motor deficit, or the laterality of the lesion, or cognitive disorder. But, some Central African specificities could explain this phenomenon. These results demonstrate the reality of post stroke depression in Africa, hence the need to think in support of any subject with stroke topic. Moreover, questions about the tools used to evaluate the post stroke depression and the time interval between stroke onset and the onset of depressive symptoms remain and require further consideration."}, {"Title": "Congenital segmental spinal muscular atrophy: a case report.", "Abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophies are genetic disorders in which anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei of the brainstem are progressively lost.

Spinal muscular atrophies with onset at birth may be a cause of arthrogryposis. Localized forms of neurogenic arthrogryposis have been divided into cervical and caudal forms. Our case is similar to the cases described by Hageman et al (J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 1993;56:365-368): severe symmetric lower motor neuron deficit in the upper extremities at the time of birth, no history of injury to the cervical spinal cord or the brachial plexus during delivery, and severe muscle wasting suggesting chronic denervation in utero. Because there was improvement of our patient's situation, her disease was also possibly nonprogressive and sporadic. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a Turkish patient with congenital cervical spinal muscular atrophy. Congenital cervical spinal muscular atrophy affecting predominantly the upper limbs is a relatively rare form of motor neuron disease and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of infants with congenital contractures and severe muscle weakness by wasting mainly confined to the upper limbs."}, {"Title": "Where are patients who have co-occurring mental and physical diseases located?", "Abstract": "Patients with a psychiatric illness have a higher prevalence of physical diseases and thus a higher morbidity and mortality.\nThe main aim was to investigate where patients with co-occurring physical diseases and mental disorders (psychotic spectrum or mood) in the health and social service system are identified most frequently before admission into psychiatry.

However, religious guidance or healing was rarely sought by patients in Europe and Japan, while in Nigeria about 80% of patients with mental disorders had contacted this type of service.\nPromoting prophylactic work between psychiatry and the general practice sector may be beneficial in diminishing physical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and overweight in patients with mental disorders in European countries and Japan.

One major focus in forensic psychology and psychiatry over the past several decades has been the development of risk assessments to aid in the identification of those individuals most at risk of exhibiting violent behavior. So-called second- and third-generation risk assessments were developed to improve the accuracy of decision making. While these instruments were developed for use in the community, many have proven to be effective in identifying patients more likely to exhibit institutional aggression. Because the purpose of risk assessment is the reduction of violence, dynamic factors were included in third-generation risk instruments to provide opportunities for intervention and methods for measuring change. Research with these instruments indicates that both static factors (second-generation) and dynamic factors (third-generation) are important in identifying those patients most likely to engage in institutional aggression, especially when the aggression is categorized by type (impulsive/reactive, organized/predatory/instrumental, psychotic). Recent research has indicated that developing a typology of aggressive incidents may provide insight both into precipitants to assaults as well as appropriate interventions to reduce such aggression. The extant literature suggests that both static and dynamic risk factors are important, but may be differentially related to the type of aggression exhibited and the characteristics of the individuals exhibiting the aggression."}, {"Title": "[Moral case deliberation about coercion in psychiatry.

While he never was interested in mental disease and what was called 'alienism' at the time, his career at La Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital over 30 years was mainly marked by the development of a huge group of students which focused on the study and management of hysteria. When Charcot took office at the beginning of 1862, hysteria was a 'no-man's land', medically speaking, since neither the alienists nor the internists had much interest in this condition. At La Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, these chronic patients were largely left to themselves before D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Bourneville, one of Charcot's first students, convinced his chief to care for them. Subsequently, the studies of Charcot with Paul Richer, Joseph Babinski, Georges Gilles de la Tourette, Paul Sollier, Pierre Janet, and many others allowed the condition to be addressed in detail. During his stay with Charcot in 1885-1866, Sigmund Freud, a young neuropathologist at the time, became fascinated by hysteria, an interest which probably was the main start of his interest in psychology. Charcot emphasized the concept of mental factors in hysteria, along with that of a 'dynamic' lesion, which accounted for the lack of neuropathological findings in the patients. While his ideas on hysteria and hypnotism were criticized after his death even by former pupils, such as Babinski, recent findings from functional studies using magnetic resonance imaging show how accurate and often visionary Charcot's thinking was in this field."}, {"Title": "Biomarkers and clinical staging in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Personalized medicine is rapidly becoming a reality in today's physical medicine. However, as yet this is largely an aspirational goal in psychiatry, despite significant advances in our understanding of the biochemical, genetic and neurobiological processes underlying major mental disorders. Preventive medicine relies on the availability of predictive tools; in psychiatry we still largely lack these. Furthermore, our current diagnostic systems, with their focus on well-established, largely chronic illness, do not support a pre-emptive, let alone a preventive, approach, since it is during the early stages of a disorder that interventions have the potential to offer the greatest benefit. Here, we present a clinical staging model for severe mental disorders and discuss examples of biological markers that have already undergone some systematic evaluation and that could be integrated into such a framework. The advantage of this model is that it explicitly considers the evolution of psychopathology during the development of a mental illness and emphasizes that progression of illness is by no means inevitable, but can be altered by providing appropriate interventions that target individual modifiable risk and protective factors. The specific goals of therapeutic intervention are therefore broadened to include the prevention of illness onset or progression, and to minimize the risk of harm associated with more complex treatment regimens. The staging model also facilitates the integration of new data on the biological, social and environmental factors that influence mental illness into our clinical and diagnostic infrastructure, which will provide a major step forward in the development of a truly pre-emptive psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Nutritional values of diets consumed by women suffering unipolar depression.", "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown that patients suffering from depression are more likely to adversely change their eating habits (eg. through increases in appetite, comfort eating and compulsive eating), which may result in an abnormal nutritional status.\nTo evaluate selected dietary habits, such as the number and type of meals consumed during a normal day and comparing dietary calorific values and nutritional content between women suffering unipolar depression to those without this condition.\nSubjects were a group of 110 women aged 18-65 years consisting of a test group of 55 women undergoing treatment for unipolar depression at the Department of Psychiatry, Medical University of Bialystok and a control group of 55 women, without depression, attending an Obesity and Diet Related Treatment Centre.

In this article, we review the neurobiological evidence, historical and recent, that originally led to this supposition and continues to support a habit hypothesis of OCD. We will then discuss a number of recent studies that have directly tested this hypothesis, using behavioural experiments in patient populations. Based on this research evidence, which suggests that rather than goal-directed avoidance behaviours, compulsions in OCD may derive from manifestations of excessive habit formation, we present the details of a novel account of the functional relationship between these habits and the full symptom profile of the disorder. Borrowing from a cognitive dissonance framework, we propose that the irrational threat beliefs (obsessions) characteristic of OCD may be a consequence, rather than an instigator, of compulsive behaviour in these patients. This lays the foundation for a potential shift in both clinical and neuropsychological conceptualization of OCD and related disorders. This model may also prove relevant to other putative disorders of compulsivity, such as substance dependence, where the experience of 'wanting' drugs may be better understood as post hoc rationalizations of otherwise goal-insensitive, stimulus-driven behaviour."}, {"Title": "Interaction between sex and early-life stress: influence on epileptogenesis and epilepsy comorbidities.", "Abstract": "Epilepsy is a common brain disorder which is characterised by recurring seizures. In addition to suffering from the constant stress of living with this neurological condition, patients also frequently experience comorbid psychiatric and cognitive disorders which significantly impact their quality of life. There is growing appreciation that stress, in particular occurring in early life, can negatively impact brain development, creating an enduring vulnerability to develop epilepsy. This aligns with the solid connections between early life environments and the development of psychiatric conditions, promoting the possibility that adverse early life events could represent a common risk factor for the later development of both epilepsy and comorbid psychiatric disorders. The influence of sex has been little studied, but recent research points to potential important interactions, particularly with regard to effects mediated by HPA axis programming. Understanding these interactions, and the underlying molecular mechanisms, will provide important new insights into the causation of both epilepsy and of psychiatric disorders, and potentially open up novel avenues for treatment."}, {"Title": "Investigation of the genetic interaction between BDNF and DRD3 genes in suicidical behaviour in psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Suicide is a serious public health concern, and it is partly genetic.

Specifically, a larger proportion of SCZ patients who were carrying at least one copy of the minor allele at each of the Val66Met and Ser9Gly functional markers have attempted suicides compared to patients with other genotypes (Bonferroni P < 0.05).

The origins of this pathology involve multiple genes as well as environmental and developmental factors leading to a disorder that remains difficult to treat. Several therapies for depression have been developed and these mainly target monoamine neurotransmitters. However, these treatments are not only associated with numerous adverse effects, but they are also ineffective for more than one-third of patients. Therefore, the need to develop new concepts to treat depression is crucial. Recently, studies using knockout mouse models have provided evidence for a crucial role of two members of the two-pore domain potassium channel (K2P ) family, tandem P-domain weak inward rectifying K(+) (TWIK)-related K(+) channel 1 (TREK-1) and TWIK-related acid-sensitive K(+) channel 3 (TASK-3) in the pathophysiology of depression. It is believed that TREK-1 and TASK-3 antagonists could lead to the development of new antidepressants. Herein, we describe the discovery of spadin, a natural peptide released from the maturation of the neurotensin receptor-3 (also known as sortilin), which specifically blocks the activity of the TREK-1 channel and displays particular antidepressant properties, with a rapid onset of action and the absence of adverse effects.

An autoimmune basis for the condition was assigned as 'Definite', 'Possible' or 'Unlikely'. The number of core features (encephalopathy, psychiatric, cognitive, epileptic, extrapyramidal and inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) was tabulated.\nTwenty-five (44.6%) patients had a Definite NMDAR-Ab encephalitis (eight ovarian teratomas, one Hodgkin's lymphoma), 18 (32.1%) a Possible NMDAR-Ab encephalitis and 13 (23.2%) an Unlikely autoimmune syndrome. Serum NMDAR-Ab levels were higher in patients with tumours. Positive NMDAR-Abs were found not only in patients with three or more core features and a Definite syndrome, but also in five patients classified as Possible. Conversely, Low Positive NMDAR-Abs were present in 7 Definite cases as well as in 13 Possible cases. Unlikely patients had mainly Low Positive antibodies and fewer core features. CSF NMDAR-Abs, only available in 11 pairs and at varying time points, broadly related to serum levels and were Positive in 3/3 patients with tumours but in only 2/5 Definite patients, and none of the Possible or Unlikely cases.\nUsing live cell-based assays, Positive and Low Positive antibodies can be of clinical significance.

Therefore, geriatric psychiatry has gradually emerged from general psychiatry. Many names have been proposed to term this sub-specialty: old age psychiatry (OAP), psychogeriatrics, geropsychiatry. A working group of the French federation of psychiatric trainees (AFFEP) set up an inventory of the theoretical instruction and clinical practice of OAP during the training of psychiatrists in France. Methods. A survey of both academic teaching and practical training for OAP was carried out in the 28 local AFFEP representatives of every French medical residency district, including overseas. We assessed the supply of general courses and seminars devoted to OAP during the training of French residents in psychiatry, and the offer of university or inter-university degrees as well as the possibility of specialized internship in every residency district. Results. 96% of French medical residency districts offered general courses of OAP with a mean volume of 11.5 hours along the four years of psychiatric training in France. Fifty percent of medical residency districts proposed at least one seminar devoted to OAP. Half of medical residency districts also offer a specialized university or inter-university degree. Concerning clinical practice, 86% of medical residency districts had one internship dedicated to OAP, in 39% of cases in teaching hospitals. Conclusion. Nationwide, there is an overall effort to make OAP available to French psychiatric residents by general courses and internship, but some disparity appeared in academic teaching (i.e. offering seminars and university/inter-university degrees) according to various residency districts."}, {"Title": "[The General Principles of Suicide Prevention Policy from the perspective of clinical psychiatry].", "Abstract": "In view of the fact that the suicide rate in Japan has remained high since 1998, the Basic Act on Suicide Prevention was implemented in 2006 with the objective of comprehensively promoting suicide prevention measures on a national scale. Based on this Basic Act, in 2007, the Japanese government formulated the General Principles of Suicide Prevention Policy as a guideline for recommended suicide prevention measures. These General Principles were revised in 2012 in accordance with the initial plan of holding a review after five years. The Basic Act places an emphasis on the various social factors that underlie suicides and takes the perspective that suicide prevention measures are also social measures. The slogan of the revised General Principles is \"Toward Realization of a Society in which Nobody is Driven to Commit Suicide\". The General Principles list various measures that are able to be used universally. These contents would be sufficient if the objective of the General Principles were \"realization of a society that is easy to live in\"; however, the absence of information on the effectiveness and order of priority for each measure may limit the specific effectiveness of the measures in relation to the actual prevention of suicide. In addition, considering that nearly 90% of suicide victims are in a state at the time of committing suicide in which a psychiatric disorder would be diagnosed, it would appear from a psychiatric standpoint that measures related to mental health, including expansion of psychiatric services, should be the top priority in suicide prevention measures. However, this is not the case in the General Principles, in either its original or revised form. Revisions to the General Principles related to clinical psychiatry provide more detailed descriptions of measures for individuals who unsuccessfully attempt suicide and identify newly targeted mental disorders other than depression; however, the overall proportion of contents relating to psychiatric care remains small. In particular, it must be noted that almost no measures are provided for individuals with chronic psychiatric disorders. We believe that the role of academic societies involved in suicide prevention, including our own, is to organize the contents of the General Principles based on evidence, to advance research in areas lacking in evidence, and to promote support for implementation of activities in areas with clear evidence."}, {"Title": "[Suicide prevention activities of psychiatry-related professional societies: the promotion of suicide prevention in psychiatric care].", "Abstract": "Suicide prevention is promoted nationally in Japan. In the General Principles of Suicide Prevention Policy determined in 2007, the areas in which, psychiatry contributed were shown to be important, for example, psychiatric care, suicide, aftercare program for suicide attempters, mental health promotion, and actual elucidation of the cause of suicide. At a part of these national measures, guidelines on suicide attempters' care are devised by the Japanese Society for Emergency Medicine and the Japanese Association for Emergency Psychiatry, and a training workshop on caring for suicide attempters was held by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The Japanese society for Emergency Medicine devised an educational program of care for patients with mental health problems in emergency care in cooperation with the Japanese Association for Emergency Psychiatry and Japanese Society of General Hospital Psychiatry. On the other hand, suicide prevention and staff care at hospitals are important problems, and the Japan Council for Quality Health Care devised a program and conducted a training workshop. Also, the Japanese Association for Suicide Prevention conducted workshops for both the educational program of cognitive-behavioral therapy and facilitator training program for gatekeeper. The Japanese Society of Mood Disorders conducted a training workshop involving clinical high-risk case discussion. Also, the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology devised clinical guidelines for suicide prevention and distributed them to all society members. In this society, on-site discussion of the guidelines and the holding of workshops are expected in the future.

In June 2007, the General Principles for Suicide Prevention Policy (GPSP), a guideline on how the national government should act to promote suicide prevention, was announced, urging local governments to tackle the problem of suicide. The GPSP was set to be revised after around five years from its publication, and, thus, a revised GPSP was published in August of 2012. Based on the five years of challenges, the revised GPSP states that suicide prevention strategies should move on to more practical and community-oriented ones. The National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry (NCNP), through its Center for Suicide Prevention, played a coordinating role in putting forward a proposal for the revision, working with 29 academic societies including the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology (JSPN). In February 2013, by further developing the relationships with academic societies, etc., which were forged in the above-mentioned process, NCNP set up the Preparatory Committee for the Evidence-based Suicide Prevention Consortium in order to contribute to suicide prevention strategies from an academic perspective. Meanwhile, in the World Health Organization's 66th World Health Assembly held in May 2013, the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020 was approved. Its core principle is \"no health without mental health\", and it has the following four objectives: (1) to strengthen effective leadership and governance for mental health; (2) to provide comprehensive, integrated, and responsive mental health and social care services in community-based settings; (3) to implement strategies for promotion and prevention in mental health; and (4) to strengthen information systems, evidence, and research for mental health. In these, objective (3) includes a numerical target for the future global suicide rate.

Two different samples (before and after the project; n = 34 and n = 29) were compared with regard to subjective parameters (e.g. patients' attitudes toward recovery, quality of life, perceived coercion, treatment satisfaction, and hope), clinical and socio-demographic basic data, as well as the functional outcome according to the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS).\nSome patient attitudes towards recovery and their self-assessment of the recovery process improved during the study. Other subjective parameters remained stable between samples. Functional outcome was better in subjects who were treated after the implementation of the new concept.

Indigenous people in South America have used ayahuasca for centuries, and the ritual has become common among the mestizo populations in urban areas of the Amazon, particularly as a curing ritual for drug addiction (Dobkin de Rios, 1970; Moir, 1998). Like peyote in the United States (Calabrese, 1997) ayahuasca use amongst the indigenous people of the Amazon is a form of cultural psychiatry. A review of the literature reveals very little commentary or discussion of shamanic practice in Pastoral Counseling (Pastoral Theology). The scant literature identifies an antithetical relationship at best. The current authors wonder about the possibility of to including shamanic practices in the context of pastoral counseling?

The underlying mechanisms are not well understood, although vitamin D is known to influence the immune system to promote a T helper (Th)-2 phenotype. At the same time, increased inflammation might be of importance in the pathophysiology of depression and suicide. We therefore hypothesized that suicidal patients would be deficient in vitamin D, which could be responsible for the inflammatory changes observed in these patients.\nWe compared vitamin D levels in suicide attempters (n=59), non-suicidal depressed patients (n=17) and healthy controls (n=14). Subjects were diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, and went through a structured interview by a specialist in psychiatry. 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 were measured in plasma using liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry (LC-MS). We further explored vitamin D's association with plasma IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1.\nSuicide attempters had significantly lower mean levels of vitamin D than depressed non-suicidal patients and healthy controls. 58 percent of the suicide attempters were vitamin D deficient according to clinical standard. Moreover, there was a significant negative association between vitamin D and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the psychiatric patients. Low vitamin D levels were associated with higher levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 in the blood.\nThe suicide attempters in our study were deficient in vitamin D. Our data also suggest that vitamin D deficiency could be a contributing factor to the elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines previously reported in suicidal patients. We propose that routine clinical testing of vitamin D levels could be beneficial in patients with suicidal symptoms, with subsequent supplementation in patients found to be deficient."}, {"Title": "Autistic disorder in Nigeria: profile and challenges to management.", "Abstract": "Autism represents one of the most common developmental disorders affecting children, but there are few reports on autism in African children.

The adult form of the disease is usually expressed as a neurological form. Non-specific psychiatric symptoms are often associated with NPC. For some cases, it can also be expressed as an isolated psychiatric disorder form. Since 2009, the launching of a medicine called miglustat has helped to improve the disease evolution.\nWe report two siblings followed-up in the same department of psychiatry and with an atypical psychotic symptomatology. Case 1 is a 27-year-old French male. He was hospitalised several times due to disordered behaviour, psychomotor excitation, mood instability and wandering. He was originally diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, the patient's psychosis proved refractory to treatment. He also exhibited a number of neurological signs (pyramidal signs and abnormal movements of the hands, head and limbs), which were considered related to his antipsychotic medication. Three years later, a full physical, neurological and neuropsychological examination revealed various neurological and visceral symptoms. He was diagnosed with NPC based on a classical biochemical NPC-phenotype following filipin staining in cultured skin fibroblasts. NPC1 gene sequencing revealed that he was a compound heterozygote for the p.S954L and p.N1156S mutations. The patient's psychiatric and neurological symptoms are currently stabilized by miglustat, allowing the patient to cease antipsychotic medication. Case 2 is the elder sister of Case 1. She was hospitalised several times due to acute delirium, hallucinations and suicidal tendencies. She was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at 22 years of age. She has received a variety of typical and atypical antipsychotics. Many of these drugs proved initially effective but the patient's symptoms repeatedly returned. The patient shows persistent and worsening gait disorder and abnormal arm movements. A follow-up neurological examination at age 29 did not detect any ataxia, cataplexy or vertical supra-nuclear gaze palsy. Direct NPC1 gene sequencing detected a mutant NPC1 allele held in common with her brother, but full sequencing of both the NPC1 and NPC2 genes and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) did not detect any other pathogenic mutation or other anomalies.\nBecause NPC is an autosomal recessive condition, heterozygous individuals carrying only one causal gene mutation are usually asymptomatic. Thus, while the accepted wisdom would suggest that patient 2 is not affected by the disease, it is interesting to consider why she has developed neurological and psychiatric disorders like her brother. Several hypotheses are discussed: mental expression in heterozygous genetic factor predisposing to schizophrenia, comorbidity or fortuitous association. It is not currently known whether a patient with a single NPC gene mutation can express NPC in full, partially, or perhaps just to a minimal degree. This case of a patient with a heterozygous \"carrier\" NPC genotype and neuropsychiatric disorders suggestive of the disease raises the possibility that symptomatic heterozygous NPC patients may exist. On the other hand, if the heterozygous genotype of patient 2 does not give rise to symptomatic disease, it is pertinent to question whether it could be a predisposing factor for the development of psychiatric pathologies. There are currently no published data on the occurrence of heterozygous NPC1 or NPC2 mutations among patients with atypical psychiatric presentations combined with neurological symptoms. Conversely, there are no published data demonstrating an increased frequency of psychiatric disorders in families affected by NPC. Finally, in view of the history of psychiatric disorders in this family, it is possible that psychosis simply occurred concomitantly with symptomatic NPC in patient 1 by chance, and that schizophrenia occurred simultaneously with an asymptomatic NPC carrier genotype in patient 2. To investigate this further, NPC patients' carrier family members (parents and siblings) should be fully screened for signs suggestive of the disease."}, {"Title": "[Bipolar disorder and quality of life: A cross-sectional study including 104 Tunisian patients].", "Abstract": "Bipolar disorder affects many psychosocial and functional aspects, leading to a real social handicap and an alteration in quality of life.\nTo evaluate bipolar patients' quality of life and to identify the risk factors responsible for a deterioration.\nOur cross-sectional study lasted for four months and included 104 bipolar patients treated at the psychiatry consultation of the university hospital in Mahdia. The data were collected through a questionnaire composed of 52 items exploring the general characteristics of subjects, the clinical and evolutional characteristics of bipolar disorder and providing information on the treatment. Quality of life was measured using the SF-36 (Short form) generic scale. A global average score was calculated and it was considered that quality of life was altered if the score was less than 66.7, according to the threshold value of L\u00e9an. Moreover, an average score was calculated for each dimension, thus permitting us to identify those most affected. We standardized initial average scores.\nThe assessment of quality of life revealed a global average of 52.2 and an alteration in 78.8% of patients. The study of the dimensional average scores revealed that all dimensions were affected. The standardization also revealed deterioration in all dimensions, the mental component being particularly more affected than the physical component with respectively estimated scores of 31.7 and 40.5. The analytic approach concerned the relationship between qualitative and quantitative variables and the occurrence of an alteration in quality of life. For this effect, a bivariate study displayed a statistically significant correlation between the eight dimensions of the SF-36 and 8 variables. In order to take into account the relationships that link each variable to the others, and to avoid the bias of the bivariate study, a logistic regression analysis was performed. Only 4 variables with discriminating weight emerged from this analysis.

Data were analysed through the lens of a theoretical framework of continuity of care in psychiatry, developed in 2004 by Joyce et al., which encompasses four domains: accessibility, individualised care, relationship base and service delivery.\nInvestigating continuity of care, we found issues of specific concern to immigrants and refugees, but also commonalities across the groups. For accessibility, areas pertinent to immigrants and refugees include lack of knowledge concerning mental illness and obligations towards children. In terms of individualised care, trauma, additional vulnerability, and taboo concerning mental illness were of specific concern. In the domain of service delivery, social services included assistance with immigration papers for immigrants and refugees. In the relationship base domain, no differences were identified. Implications for priority area: The treatment courses of patients in the psychiatric field are complex and diverse and the patient perspective of continuity of care provides important insight into the delivery of care. The study highlights the importance of person-centred care irrespective of migration background though it may be beneficial to have an awareness of areas that may be of more specific concern to immigrants and refugees.\nThe study sheds light on concerns specific to immigrants and refugees in a framework of continuity of care, but also commonalities across the patient groups."}, {"Title": "Anxiety, depression and quality of life in patients with beta thalassemia major and their caregivers.", "Abstract": "Mental health and health related quality of life is commonly affected in patients with chronic problems and their caregivers. In the present study, it was aimed to assess depression and anxiety in patients with beta thalassemia major (BTM) and in their caregivers; and to evaluate effects of these disorders on quality of life. The study was carried out in a district Hereditary Hemoglobinopathy Center and included 88 patients with BTM and 63 of their caregivers. All subjects were assessed using Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Short Form-36 (SF-36) by a trained psychiatry resident via face-to-face interview. The BDI scores were 17 or above in 20.5% of the patients with BTM and 28.6% of their caregivers (P = 0.248). Of the patients with BTM, there were mild anxiety symptoms in 19.3%, while moderate and severe anxiety symptoms in 14.8% and 4.5%, respectively. Anxiety levels were similar between the patients with BTM and their caregivers (P = 0.878). It was found that BDI and BAI scores were negatively correlated to scores of physical health and mental health components of SF-36 in patients with BTM and their caregivers. In linear regression analysis, it was seen that depression affected physical and mental health of the patients with BTM and their caregivers regardless from anxiety. BTM leads an increase in the frequency of depression and anxiety in both patients and their caregivers, and affects negatively physical and mental components of quality of life."}, {"Title": "The German version of the self-injurious thoughts and behaviors interview (SITBI-G): a tool to assess non-suicidal self-injury and suicidal behavior disorder.", "Abstract": "Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) are common in adolescents. While there is no standardized interview in German to assess SITBs to date, the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI) is widely used in English-speaking countries. However, the SITBI has not been validated for the assessment of the recently issued DSM-5 Section 3 diagnoses of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behavior disorder (SBD) yet. In the present study the psychometric properties of the German version of the SITBI (SITBI-G) were assessed. We also evaluated whether SITBI-G is a reliable and valid instrument to establish diagnoses of NSSI and SBD.\nA clinical adolescent sample (N = 111, f/m = 73/38, age range = 12-19 years) was recruited from the inpatient units of three departments of child and adolescent psychiatry in Germany. All participating patients were interviewed by using the SITBI-G, and DSM-5 criteria of NSSI and SBD were operationalized from the SITBI-G data. Additionally, participants were given the Self-Harm Behavior Questionnaire (SHBQ), and SITBI-G was retested in a subsample.\nThe SITBI-G shows moderate to good test-retest reliability, a very good interrater reliability, and a good construct validity. The results demonstrate that diagnoses of NSSI and SBD can be established using the SITBI-G, achieving moderate to good test-retest reliabilities and very good to perfect interrater reliabilities.\nOverall, the good psychometric properties of SITBI-G are comparable to the original version of the interview. Therefore, SITBI-G seems to be highly appropriate to assess SITBs, including the new DSM-5 Section 3 diagnoses NSSI and SBD in research and clinical contexts."}, {"Title": "Community psychiatry's achievements.", "Abstract": "Mental health care in the second half of the 20th century in much of the developed world has been dominated by the move out from large asylums.

By clinical cytogenetic testing, we identified a family in which two brothers had ASD, mild intellectual disability and a chromosome 22 pericentric inversion, not detected in either parent, indicating de novo mutation with parental germinal mosaicism. We hypothesised that the rearrangement was causative of their ASD and localised the chromosome 22 breakpoints.\nThe rearrangement was characterised using fluorescence in situ hybridisation, Southern blotting, inverse PCR and dideoxy-sequencing. Open reading frames and intron/exon boundaries of the two physically disrupted genes identified, TCF20 and TNRC6B, were sequenced in 342 families (260 multiplex and 82 simplex) ascertained by the International Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium (IMGSAC).\nIMGSAC family screening identified a de novo missense mutation of TCF20 in a single case and significant association of a different missense mutation of TCF20 with ASD in three further families. Through exome sequencing in another project, we independently identified a de novo frameshifting mutation of TCF20 in a woman with ASD and moderate intellectual disability. We did not identify a significant association of TNRC6B mutations with ASD.\nTCF20 encodes a transcriptional coregulator (also termed SPBP) that is structurally and functionally related to RAI1, the critical dosage-sensitive protein implicated in the behavioural phenotypes of the Smith-Magenis and Potocki-Lupski 17p11.2 deletion/duplication syndromes, in which ASD is frequently diagnosed.

Attentive listeners discover a lot about the affective state of their dialog partners with no great effort, and without having to talk about it explicitly during a conversation or on the phone. On the other hand, speech dysfunctions, such as slow, delayed or monotonous speech, are prominent features of affective disorders.\nThis project was comprised of four studies with healthy volunteers from Bristol (English: n = 117), Lausanne (French: n = 128), Zurich (German: n = 208), and Valencia (Spanish: n = 124). All samples were stratified according to gender, age, and education. The specific study design with different types of spoken text along with repeated assessments at 14-day intervals allowed us to estimate the 'natural' variation of speech parameters over time, and to analyze the sensitivity of speech parameters with respect to form and content of spoken text. Additionally, our project included a longitudinal self-assessment study with university students from Zurich (n = 18) and unemployed adults from Valencia (n = 18) in order to test the feasibility of the speech analysis method in home environments.\nThe normative data showed that speaking behavior and voice sound characteristics can be quantified in a reproducible and language-independent way. The high resolution of the method was verified by a computerized assignment of speech parameter patterns to languages at a success rate of 90%, while the correct assignment to texts was 70%. In the longitudinal self-assessment study we calculated individual 'baselines' for each test person along with deviations thereof. The significance of such deviations was assessed through the normative reference data.\nOur data provided gender-, age-, and language-specific thresholds that allow one to reliably distinguish between 'natural fluctuations' and 'significant changes'. The longitudinal self-assessment study with repeated assessments at 1-day intervals over 14 days demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of the speech analysis method in home environments, thus clearing the way to a broader range of applications in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The development and evaluation of a trauma curriculum for psychiatry residents.", "Abstract": "This study aims to briefly describe a curriculum on trauma in order to help other educators in their own planning and development of teaching on trauma.\nThe 12-week course was offered to third-year psychiatry residents as part of their didactics scheduling. The classes included information on a wide variety of types of trauma including natural disasters, childhood trauma, refugee trauma, survivors of torture, intimate partner violence, and military sexual trauma. The course also offered techniques in therapy informed by transference and countertransference along with role-playing activities with the resident participants.

Similarly, the proportion of residents who indicated they now screen for trauma increased as well. However, these were nonsignificant changes. There was no change in the proportion of residents who felt comfortable assessing for trauma before and after the curriculum. Even after the course, almost half of the respondents reported that they were still not comfortable in asking about refugee's experience of trauma or torture\nMore residents reported that they screen for trauma after the curriculum.

Ambivalence denotes both inward uncertainty and a collective process that emerges in the midst of everyday work. In their commentaries about ambivalence, providers struggle with the distance separating their preferred professional self-image as caring from the routine practices of constraint. A detailed case study, drawn from 2\u00a0years of qualitative research in a U.S. community psychiatry agency, traces providers' response to the major tools of constraint common in such settings: outpatient commitment and collusion between the mental health and criminal justice systems. The case features a near-breakdown of clinical work caused by sharp disagreements over the ethical legitimacy of constraint. The ethnography depicts clinicians' experience of ambivalence as the complex product of their professional socialization, their relationships with clients, and on-going workplace debates about allowable and forbidden uses of power. As people articulate their ethical sensibility toward constraint, they stumble over the enduring fault lines of community psychiatry, and they also develop an ethos of care tailored to the immediate circumstances, the implicit ideologies, and the broad social contexts of their work."}, {"Title": "Confinement and psychiatric care: a comparison between high-security units for prisoners and for difficult patients in France.", "Abstract": "This paper examines the uncertain meaning of confinement in psychiatric care practices. Investigating the recent expansion of high-security units in French public psychiatry, for patients with dangerous behavior (units for difficult patients) and for suffering prisoners (specially equipped hospital units), we aim to understand psychiatry's use of confinement as part of its evolving mandate over suffering individuals with violent behavior. Although historically the epicenter of secure psychiatric care for dangerous individuals shifted from the asylum to the prison, a review of public reports and psychiatric literature demonstrates that psychiatrists' attempt to reclaim confinement as part of therapeutic practice underpinned the recent development of new units. Institutional-level analysis emphasizes psychiatry's enduring concern to subordinate social defense motives to a therapeutic rationale. Analyzing local professionals' justifications for these units in two emblematic hospitals, the paradoxical effects of a security-driven policy arise: they allowed the units' existence, yet prevented psychiatrists from defending a genuine therapeutic justification for confinement. Instead, professionals differentiate each unit's respective mission, underlining the concern for access to care and human dignity or defending the need for protection and safety from potentially dangerous patients. This process reveals the difficulty of defining confinement practices as care when autonomy is a core social value."}, {"Title": "Learning constraint.

Based on a collection of essays written by these professionals as part of their training as well as on other archival materials, the article explores writing practices in post-war French psychiatry as ways of constructing and negotiating moral commitments to work. The first three sections of the article give some background on mental health nursing in France in the immediate post-war period. The subsequent three sections examine how the professionals elaborated on their experiences in their writings, focusing on three different levels: first, the narrative voice used in the essays; second, the learning processes described by trainees; and finally, the ways in which they negotiated discursively the requirement to do emotionally well at work."}, {"Title": "The high burden of inpatient diabetes mellitus: the Melbourne Public Hospitals Diabetes Inpatient Audit.", "Abstract": "To determine the prevalence of diabetes in inpatients in Melbourne hospitals.\nPoint prevalence survey of all inpatients in each hospital on a single day between 30 November 2010 and 22 November 2012.\n11 hospitals in metropolitan Melbourne including community, secondary and tertiary hospitals and one aged care and rehabilitation centre.\n2308 adult inpatients in all wards apart from intensive care, emergency, obstetrics and psychiatry.\nPoint prevalence of self-reported diabetes, details of current medication, self-reported frequency of complications.\nDiabetes status was obtained in 2273 of 2308 inpatients (98.5%).

According to this scenario, in this paper we introduce approximate temporal functional dependencies (ATFDs) and use them to mine clinical data. Specifically, we considered the need for deriving new knowledge from psychiatric and pharmacovigilance data. ATFDs may be defined and measured either on temporal granules (e.g.grouping data by day, week, month, year) or on sliding windows (e.g.a fixed-length time interval which moves over the time axis): in this regard, we propose and discuss some specific and efficient data mining techniques for ATFDs. We also developed two running prototypes and showed the feasibility of our proposal by mining two real-world clinical data sets. The clinical interest of the dependencies derived considering the psychiatry and pharmacovigilance domains confirms the soundness and the usefulness of the proposed techniques."}, {"Title": "[The effect of the sociodemographic and the socioeconomic factors on criminal behavior of male patients with a bipolar I disorder].", "Abstract": "This study evaluates the influence of socioeconomic and demographic factors on the criminal behavior of male patients with bipolar type I disorder.\nA total of 48 male patients diagnosed with type I bipolar disorder according to DSM IV criteria and a criminal history in a forensic psychiatry facility and 53 male patients with the same diagnosis but without a criminal history who were treated at the Bakirkoy Prof. Dr. Mazhar Osman Training and Research Hospital for Psychiatry, Neurology and Neurosurgery were included in the study group.

His interest in phenomena of physical mediumship is considered against the backdrop of the theoretical developments in Italian psychiatry and psychology. A leading positivist psychiatrist and a prolific academic, Morselli was actively involved in the making of Italian experimental psychology. Initially sceptical of psychical research and opposed to its association with the 'new psychology', Morselli subsequently conducted a study of the physical phenomena produced by the medium Eusapia Palladino. He concluded that her phenomena were genuine and represented them as the effects of an unknown bio-psychic force present in all human beings. By contextualizing Morselli's study of physical mediumship within contemporary theoretical and disciplinary discourse, this study elaborates shifts in the interpretations of 'supernormal' phenomena put forward by leading Italian psychiatrists and physiologists. It demonstrates that Morselli's interest in psychical research stems from his efforts to comprehend the determinants of complex psychological phenomena at a time when the dynamic theory of matter in physics, and the emergence of neo-vitalist theories influenced the theoretical debates in psychiatry, psychology and physiology."}, {"Title": "Caregiver burden in families of patients with depression attending Obafemi Awolowo University teaching hospitals complex Ile-Ife Nigeria.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess caregiver burden among relatives of patients on treatment for depressive disorder attending the psychiatry outpatient clinic of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile Ife, Nigeria.\nA cross sectional design was used.

The academy of Swiss insurance medicine, ASIM, worked together with Georgian representatives to develop the principles of functional assessment and provide a method of applying these principles. As instrument for output specification the Mini ICF APP was selected, translated and back translated from German to Georgian. A training course of one day was conducted after which psychiatrists tested the approach in 5 cases each and suggested minor modifications of interpretation. After this they each performed 40 assessments with the new methodology. Doing the assessments with the new procedure was appreciated by all participants and provoked no problems. Being asked to fill out the Mini ICF form in a systematic fashion makes the reports more objective and transparent. The shift to a functional approach in evaluation of disability for work is practicable with the methodology ASIM has developed for this purpose and this fits with the present legislation. This approach could be used in other fields than psychiatry as well."}, {"Title": "Politics, profit, and psychiatric diagnosis: a case study of tobacco use disorder.", "Abstract": "The idea of tobacco or nicotine dependence as a specific psychiatric diagnosis appeared in 1980 and has evolved through successive editions of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. Not surprisingly, the tobacco industry attempted to challenge this diagnosis through behind-the-scenes influence. But another entity put corporate muscle into supporting the diagnosis-the pharmaceutical industry. Psychiatry's ongoing professional challenges have left it vulnerable to multiple professional, social, and commercial forces. The example of tobacco use disorder illustrates that mental health concepts used to develop public health goals and policy need to be critically assessed. I review the conflicting commercial, professional, and political aims that helped to construct psychiatric diagnoses relating to smoking. This history suggests that a diagnosis regarding tobacco has as much to do with social and cultural circumstances as it does with science."}, {"Title": "Current state of psychotherapy training: preparing for the future.", "Abstract": "This article provides an overview of what is currently being taught in psychiatry residency programs about psychotherapy in general, and to evolving changes in the field related to mental health parity and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in particular. Future psychiatrists must have a firm grasp of not only the principles of psychotherapy but also the development of increasingly effective and evidence-based psychotherapies if they are to be effective health care leaders. We review what attracts medical students to psychiatry and how much their decision to train in psychiatry is rooted in a desire to learn both dynamic psychiatry and psychotherapy in its various modalities. It is no secret that the quality of teaching and learning psychotherapy is variable in our training programs. One reason for this can be attributed to trainees who ascribe more to the biological dimensions of our field and have less interest and commitment to more than basic skills in psychotherapy. In addition, in some settings there is a dearth of teachers trained in the various forms of psychotherapy who are committed to this pedagogical imperative. We conclude with several recommendations to residency training programs and to residents themselves regarding what we deem essential in both the curricular and clinical exposure to the challenges and shortcomings of the mental health parity and Affordable Care Act. Tomorrow's psychiatrists have a fiduciary responsibility of advocating for their complex and chronically ill patients that must include providing psychotherapy."}, {"Title": "Norman Geschwind and the use of history in the (re)birth of behavioral neurology.", "Abstract": "When Norman Geschwind (1926-1984) attended medical school in the 1940s, his psychiatry professors taught as if behavior were unrelated to neuropathology. The focus of neurology remained the diagnosis and treatment of aphasias and epilepsies, while cognitive impairments and developmental disorders were classified as functional (psychological) disorders. Geschwind was troubled by the fact that many of the patients he saw with neurological deficits also presented with behavioral (developmental) disorders. Geschwind's generation also had been taught that aphasias resulted from global rather than localized or focal neurological lesions. These holists, including the prepsychoanalytic Sigmund Freud, targeted the work of aphasiologist Carl Wernicke as an exemplar of the flaws of the localizationist hypothesis. Reading Wernicke in the original, Geschwind discovered a complex and multilayered explanation for aphasias that implicated lesions located in association pathways that, when extensive, resulted in behavioral disorders. Geschwind also reread the works of the holists, discovering that, while their rhetoric rejected Wernicke, their explanations of aphasias actually reinforced Wernicke's hypothesis. Building on his reading of these historical documents and his clinical experiences, Geschwind urged the resurrection of Wernicke's disconnection syndromes that Geschwind labeled as Behavioral Neurology."}, {"Title": "The role of lead and cadmium in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric disorders are associated with long-term disability and huge social and economic costs. The possible influence of heavy metals exposure on public health remains a matter of concern. A recurring research question that persisted among researchers in neuropsychiatry has been \"are psychiatric patients more likely to have a high body burden of lead or other heavy metals?\" This is an update account on the role of lead and cadmium in psychiatry. This review, which has employed search words like \"lead and cadmium in psychiatry\", \"lead and cadmium in schizophrenia\", \"lead and cadmium in psychosis\" in citation indices such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Scirus, and Scopus. A total of 415 articles were found; 60 fulfiled the inclusion criteria. Evidence-based information suggests that lead and cadmium may be involved in psychiatry. Should environmental lead and cadmium be implicated in the etiogenesis of psychiatry given the characteristic high environmental pollution in Sub Sahara Africa, it is worthwhile for toxicologists and scientists in Sub-Sahara Africa to investigate if lead and cadmium can become additional biomarkers in the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Anxiety- and depression-like behavior and impaired neurogenesis evoked by peripheral neuropathy persist following resolution of prolonged tactile hypersensitivity.", "Abstract": "Pain and depression are frequently associated with and often persist after resolution of an initial injury. Identifying the extent to which depression remains causally associated with ongoing physical discomfort during chronic pain, or becomes independent of it, is an important problem for basic neuroscience and psychiatry. Difficulty in distinguishing between effects of ongoing aversive sensory input and its long-term consequences is a significant roadblock, especially in animal models. To address this relationship between localized physical discomfort and its more global consequences, we investigated cellular and behavioral changes during and after reversing a mouse model of neuropathic pain. Tactile allodynia produced by placing a plastic cuff around the sciatic nerve resolved within several days when the cuff was removed. In contrast, the changes in elevated O-maze, forced-swim, Y-maze spontaneous alternation and novel-object recognition test performance that developed after nerve cuff placement remained for at least 3 weeks after the nerve cuffs were removed, or 10-15 d following complete normalization of mechanical sensitivity. Hippocampal neurogenesis, measured by doublecortin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, was also suppressed after nerve cuff placement and remained suppressed 3 weeks after cuff removal. FosB expression was elevated in the central nucleus of the amygdala and spinal cord dorsal horn only in mice with ongoing allodynia. In contrast, FosB remained elevated in the basolateral amygdala of mice with resolved nociception and persisting behavioral effects. These observations suggest that different processes control tactile hypersensitivity and the behavioral changes and impaired neurogenesis that are associated with neuropathic allodynia."}, {"Title": "Impact of somatic comorbidities on quality of life of patients living with epilepsy in Sagamu, Nigeria.", "Abstract": "Somatic comorbidities are probably as important as the psychiatry comorbidities in people with epilepsy (PWE) although the former has received little attention especially in low- and middle-income countries where the incidence of epilepsy is high. The main objective of this study was to determine the frequencies of somatic comorbidities in PWE. We also compared quality of life of two groups of PWE: Those with somatic comorbidities and those without.\nIn this comparative cross-sectional study, consecutive adult patients with epilepsy above 18 years of age were recruited at the neurology outpatient clinic of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital from July 2010 through March 2011. Epilepsy-related data and somatic comorbidities were collated in this population. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and depression were also measured using QOLIE-31(version 1.0) and Becks depression inventory II (BDI-II), respectively.\nOne hundred and two PWE were recruited with 31 (30.4%) having at least one somatic comorbidity. Hypertension (OR = 12.43), dyspepsia (OR = 8.16), and stroke (OR = undefined) were significantly prevalent among PWE who are \u226550 years old. Energy was significantly lower among patients with comorbidities, and patients with multiple comorbidities had worse quality of life than those with single comorbidity (P = 0.006).\nSomatic comorbidity is prevalent in this population with significant impact on their quality of life. We emphasize the need to screen for and reduce the numbers of somatic comorbidities in PWE as this can improve their quality of life."}, {"Title": "Transforming mental health services: a participatory mixed methods study to promote and evaluate the implementation of recovery-oriented services.", "Abstract": "Since 2007, the Mental Health Commission of Canada has worked collaboratively across all provinces to publish a framework and strategy for recovery and well-being. This federal document is now mandated as policy for implementation between 2012 and 2017. The proposed strategies have been written into provincial health plans, hospital accreditation standards, and annual objectives of psychiatric departments and community organizations. The core premise is: to empower persons with mental illness and their families to become participants in designing their own care, while meeting the needs of a diverse Canadian population. However, recovery principles do not come with an implementation guide to fit the variability of different local contexts. How can policy recommendations and accreditation standards be effectively tailored to support a diversity of stakeholder values? To our knowledge, there is little evidence indicating the most effective manner to accelerate the uptake of recovery-oriented services among providers in a given/particular mental health treatment setting.\nThis three-year Canadian Institute of Health Research Partnership in Health System Improvement and The Rx&D Health Research Foundation (HRF) Fostering Canadian Innovation in Research study (2013 to 2017) proposed participatory approaches to implementing recovery principles in a Department of Psychiatry serving a highly diverse Canadian and immigrant population. This project will be conducted in overlapping and recursive phases: I) Conduct formative research to (a) measure the current knowledge and attitudes toward recovery and recovery-oriented practices among service providers, while concurrently (b) exploring the experiential knowledge of recovery service-users and family members; II) Collaborate with service-users and the network-identified opinion leaders among providers to tailor Recovery-in-Action Initiatives to fit the needs and resources of a Department of Psychiatry; and III) Conduct a systematic theory-based evaluation of changes in attitudes and practices within the service-user/service-provider partnership group relative to the overall provider network of the department and identify the barriers and supports within the local context.\nOur anticipated outcome is a participatory toolkit to tailor recovery-oriented services, which will be disseminated to the Mental Health Commission of Canada and Accreditation Canada at the federal level, agencies at the provincial levels, and local knowledge end-users."}, {"Title": "The media campaign on the DSM-5: recurring comments and lessons for the future of diagnosis in psychiatric practice.", "Abstract": "Recurring arguments in the media campaign preceding and following the publication of the DSM-5 have been that the manual, referred to as 'the bible of psychiatry', mislabels many people who are basically normal, and that the diagnostic categories it contains are invalid, not being based on laboratory tests. We present data on the use of the DSM worldwide, and discuss the need to assess systematically the pros and cons of operational and prototype approaches to psychiatric diagnosis. We consider different views about what qualifies as mental disorder and how the boundary between pathology and normality should be fixed. We review the role of laboratory tests as applied in medicine, emphasising that most of them are probabilistic, not pathognomonic, markers of disease.

It is a complex and multidimensional notion, on the borderline between genetics, neurophysiology, anthropology of culture, sociology, medicine, political science, developmental psychology and psychiatry. The phenomenon of resilience is interactive (as it combines the experience of trauma with adaptation to it), it is difficult to measure and it raises serious methodological concerns. They tend to be so significant that some researchers consider resilience to be a construct of dubious scientific value. Such a view seems to be overly critical, however it indicates the magnitude of methodological difficulties. This article discusses some of them: problems with definitions and terminology, measurement difficulties associated with the interactive nature of resilience, the need to search for complex interactions between biological, psychological, social and environmental factors (rather than overly simplistic focus on individual factors which support good adaptation). The methodological issues have been divided into the following research areas: the nature of traumatic experiences, response to trauma, factors which impact the reporting of the reaction to trauma, developmental problems."}, {"Title": "Prolonged mechanical ventilation in Canadian intensive care units: a national survey.", "Abstract": "We sought to describe prevalence and care practices for patients experiencing prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV), defined as ventilation for 21 or more consecutive days and medical stability.\nWe provided the survey to eligible units via secure Web link to a nominated unit champion from April to November 2012.

Psychiatry has come of age: it is perhaps more difficult for the current generation of psychiatrists, to comprehend how the biological root of the condition could have been denied for so long. Here we review how highly collaborative global efforts to pool samples, utilise the very latest advances in genotyping and high throughput sequencing technologies, and application of robust statistical analysis have reaped phenomenal rewards. The major findings are that schizophrenia is a highly polygenic disorder with a complex array of risk loci, many include genes implicated also in intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. These candidate genes converge on key neuronal signalling pathways identifying novel targets for potential future therapeutic intervention."}, {"Title": "Clinical applications of CYP genotyping in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "A critical review of the limited available evidence and the authors' experience and judgment are used to summarize the role of cytochrome P450 (CYP) genetic variants in the pharmacokinetics of and clinical response to psychotropic medications. CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genetic polymorphisms and their contributions to the metabolism of psychotropic drugs are reviewed. CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 genotyping have limited current clinical utility. CYP2C9 genotyping has no utility in psychiatry. Psychiatrists should master tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) prescription, and if they use TCAs, they should have expertise in CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotyping and in TCA therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to safely dose TCAs. Practice guidelines recommend dose changes, TDM or alternate drugs for (1) CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers (UM) taking citalopram or escitalopram; (2) CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (PMs) taking sertraline; (3) CYP2D6 PMs taking venlafaxine, aripiprazole, haloperidol, risperidone or zuclopenthixol; and (4) CYP2D6 UMs taking venlafaxine, aripiprazole, haloperidol, risperidone, zuclopenthixol or atomoxetine. According to the prescribing information, CYP2D6 PMs should receive 75\u00a0% of the average long-acting aripiprazole dose and pimozide doses >4\u00a0mg/day should not be prescribed without CYP2D6 genotyping. In a situation of limited evidence, there is need to use the available pharmacological mechanistic information for better personalizing treatment in psychiatry. This is best done by combining CYP genotyping with TDM. Clozapine and risperidone concentration-to-dose ratios are provided as two examples of this approach of how to integrate CYP genotyping and TDM in psychiatry. New studies are needed to verify that CYP2C19 PM genotyping may have potential to identify clozapine PMs and explain the lower clozapine metabolic capacity in East Asians."}, {"Title": "A stone never cut for: a new interpretation of The Cure of Folly by Jheronimus Bosch.", "Abstract": "From the late 15th century onwards, cutting for stones in patients' heads to cure mental illness was depicted in European art. The earliest and most famous painting of this kind is The Cure of Folly, painted by Jheronimus Bosch around the turn of the 15th to the 16th century. In general, these depictions are thought to relate to surgical as well as mental health practices of that time. However, it can be questioned whether barber surgeons or quacks cut for stones in patients' heads, and if they did not, what the meaning of Bosch's and other artists' paintings might be. Paintings from the 15th to 17th centuries and historical sources from the history of medicine as well as art history served as a basis for this contribution. The combination of sources from the histories of urology and psychiatry opens a new perspective on depictions of cranial lithotomy. Taking this into account, it does not seem likely that surgeons or quacks cut for cranial stones in early modern Europe. Few therapy options existed to effectively treat mental problems, and, hence, most interpretations of Bosch's picture point to the gullibility of patients as its central theme. At the same time, the depictions of cranial lithotomy may illustrate the limits of the medical profession and an abstract hope for successful psychosurgery analogous to the surgical removal of stones from the urinary tract."}, {"Title": "Implementation and outcome of child psychotherapy compared with other psychiatric treatments in a naturalistic clinical setting.", "Abstract": "Mental health problems of children are commonly treated by psychotherapy and other psychosocial treatments.

All 118 children (aged < 16 years) referred to psychotherapy from the Department of Child Psychiatry in 1996-2005 and 118 age- and sex-matched children undergoing other psychosocial treatments were included. A lack of later recorded psychiatric problems was used as an indicator of good treatment outcome.\nOn referral, functional ability was severely impaired in almost half of the children (Children's Global Assessment Scale score < 55). Internalizing symptoms were more common in the psychotherapy group, while no difference was found in externalizing symptoms between the groups. In both groups, later psychiatric problems were associated with a child's low functional ability and poor parental coping with their responsibilities. Children with internalizing problems had impaired prognosis if they had psychosocial treatments other than psychotherapy.\nIndividual psychotherapy should especially be considered for children with internalizing symptoms, but the outcome of psychiatric treatment depends not only on children's own functional abilities, but also on parental abilities."}, {"Title": "World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of dementias in primary care.", "Abstract": "To define a practice guideline for biological treatment of dementias for general practitioners in primary care.\nThis paper is a short and practical summary of the World Federation of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for the Biological treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias for treatment in primary care ( Ihl et al. 2011 ).

Developmental trajectories (as opposed to static measures) have proven to have greater power in discriminating healthy from clinical groups and in predicting cognitive/behavioral measures, such as IQ. Here we summarize results from an ongoing longitudinal pediatric neuroimaging study that has been conducted at the Child Psychiatry Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health since 1989. Developmental trajectories of structural MRI brain measures from healthy youth are compared and contrasted with trajectories in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and childhood-onset schizophrenia.

The principal orientation of the six aberrant cortical functional connectivities was sagittal; five of them involved both hemispheres. In sum, activity in the posterior brain areas of preprocessing functions and the anterior brain areas of evaluation and behavior control functions were compromised by either decreased coupled activation or increased coupled inhibition, common across schizophrenia subtypes in the three patient groups.

Aspects of stigma assessed in the questionnaire included perceived stigma, self-stigma (stereotype agreement), attitudes toward the other profession, and experiences of discrimination. Psychiatrists reported significantly higher perceived stigma and discrimination experiences than general practitioners. Separate multiple regression analyses showed different predictor patterns of perceived stigma in the two groups. Hence, in the psychiatrists group, perceived stigma correlated best with discrimination experiences and self-stigma, while in the general practitioners group it correlated best with self-stigma. About 17% of the psychiatrists perceive stigma as a serious problem, with a higher rate in younger respondents. Against this background, psychiatry as a medical profession should set a high priority on improving the training of young graduates.

A clinical attitude that focuses on a child's development from this viewpoint is required. Development is understood from such a viewpoint; how a psychiatric disorder of a juvenile progresses to adulthood is described. In other words, an adult's psychiatric disorder reflects insufficient progression during mental development or a latent psychiatric disorder during childhood. The psychiatrist who looks at an adult patient from such viewpoints, would have insight into child psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Need to merge child and adult psychiatry into comprehensive developmental psychiatry--consideration from the perspective of forensic psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The need to merge child and adult psychiatry into a continuum was discussed based on forensic issues in criminal cases involving developmental disorder. Recently, a number of offenders (both juvenile and adult) are being diagnosed with developmental disorder every year, when the system of sending severe juvenile cases from juvenile court to the prosecution as well as the new juror system makes the role of psychiatric examination more important than ever. Because of the unique symptomatology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), conventional forensic psychiatry does not seem applicable to cases of ASD when making a fair judgement on criminal liability. This indicates that there is a need for not only basic knowledge on child psychiatry for all psychiatrists, but also knowledge on the developmental link between child and adult psychiatry. Therefore, there is a need to merge child and adult psychiatry into a comprehensive field of developmental psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Education and training system in child and adolescent psychiatry with view to carry-over towards adulthood psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The aim of our study was to develop and establish a training system in child and adolescent psychiatry in Japan, especially in light of the continuity and integration with general psychiatry.\nThe Japanese authors surveyed the situation of training in child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP training) through the literature and conducted collaborative and consensus meetings with the authors in the UK, with its long history of training system development. A comparison was made between Japan and CAP training in the UK and other countries.\nA recent survey of psychiatric education in Japan clarified the current situation and called attention to parts of the education and training system where development is required. A systematic curriculum has not been established. For the elimination of disparities of competencies and skills among multidisciplinary staff, the CAP training curriculum needs to be comprehensive and fundamental, as shown in the Competency-based Curriculum for Specialists developed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists.\nCAP training and general psychiatry must be integrated into a comprehensive curriculum in the postgraduate education and training system, with an adequate time and place for training and supervision."}, {"Title": "[Enrichment of the functions of the psychiatric department in a general hospital and collaboration within the area].", "Abstract": "Psychiatric disease has been included in the five main diseases, and a medical care plan is required. In it, there are many problems, for example, physical complications and which general hospital should chiefly deal with it. Here, we present a way to cope with these problems on the basis of achievements in the psychiatric department of Kameda General Hospital. Specifically, we would like to assert that creating a consultation-liaison team and enriching the section of clinical psychiatry are very important and effective. The activities of the consultation-liaison team, created to address various issues after establishing a psychiatric ward, have led to the possibility of a psychiatric department in a general hospital. Experience to date indicates that, in the context of a general hospital with a psychiatric inpatient unit, the existence of a multidisciplinary liaison team working across departmental boundaries is crucial to determining and managing the treatment of patients with psychiatric emergencies, as well as patients with psychiatric issues and physical complications. Additionally, in order to increase the effectiveness of the hospital liaison team, it is critical to realize seamless, prompt collaboration with facilities outside the hospital. In this respect, the role of a patient care coordinator is expected to become increasingly important. Additionally, enriching and guarding activities of clinical psychologists have contributed to the growth of psychiatric departments in general hospitals and proved to be effective in combination with activities of the consultation-liaison team."}, {"Title": "[The Regional Health Care Strategic Plan in Nagano Prefecture: process and principles].", "Abstract": "The Regional Health Care Strategic Plan has included mental disorders as the fifth \"priority disease\".

The effect of framing on risk assessment decision making in psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "The way that information is presented is well known to induce a range of biases in human decision tasks. Little research exists on framing effects in psychiatric decision making, but it is reasonable to assume that psychiatrists are not immune and, if so, there may be implications for the welfare of patients, staff and the general public.\nTo investigate whether presentation of risk information in different formats (frequency, percentage and semantic) influences inpatient admission decisions by psychiatrists.\nSix-hundred seventy-eight general adult psychiatrists read a short clinical vignette presenting a case scenario of a patient presenting for inpatient admission. One of four condition questions followed the vignette, incorporating either numerical or percentage probabilities and the semantic labels \"high\" and \"low\" risk. In each condition, the actual risk was identical, but the way it was presented varied. The decision to admit the patient or not was recorded and compared across conditions.\nMore individuals chose to admit the patient when risk information was presented in numerical form (X2\u2009=\u20097.43, p\u2009=\u20090.006) and with the semantic label \"high\" (X2\u2009=\u20097.27, p\u2009=\u20090.007).\nPresentation of risk information may influence decision making in psychiatrists.

Voxel-based morphometry was used to compare local gray and white matter volumes, and a novel pattern classification approach was used to discriminate between UD and BD, while training the classifier at one imaging site and testing in an independent sample at the other site. The Pittsburgh sample of participants was recruited from the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic at the University of Pittsburgh from 2008 to 2012. The M\u00fcnster sample was recruited from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of M\u00fcnster from 2010 to 2012. Equally divided between the 2 sites were 58 currently depressed patients with bipolar I disorder, 58 age- and sex-matched unipolar depressed patients, and 58 matched healthy controls.\nMagnetic resonance imaging was used to detect structural differences between groups.

Videotaped interviews provide a window into the psychotherapeutic exchange, demystifying the process and capturing verbal and nonverbal interactions, facial expression, and tone of voice-which can illustrate therapeutic elements such as the alliance and resistance. The process of videotaping psychotherapeutic interviews, however, introduces issues related to consent, ethics, and the dynamics of therapy. By examining two cases in which residents asked their patients to videotape a session for didactic purposes and encountered divergent outcomes, we explore the ethical issues unique to providing informed consent for videotaping psychotherapy. Informed consent must be given verbally and in writing. Verbal consent must include discussion of the risks and benefits of therapy. The discussion must also include the risks inherent in memorializing sensitive material on an external device, with disclosure of the logistics of how data will be stored, who will view the recorded material, and when it will be destroyed. Therapists should be aware of the coercive power inherent in the physician-patient relationship and should individualize each informed consent procedure with this knowledge in mind. Despite these potential pitfalls, videotaping sessions provides a wealth of information about both patients and therapists that can improve psychotherapy teaching and supervision, and indirectly improve patient care."}, {"Title": "Pilot assessment and survey of Syrian refugees' psychological stress and openness to referral for telepsychiatry (PASSPORT Study).", "Abstract": "Given the scarcity of mental health resources available for refugees in areas of conflict, it is imperative to investigate interventions that would be accepted by the refugees.\nIn this study we surveyed 354 Syrian refugees using the HADStress screening tool and asked about their openness to referral to psychiatry and telepsychiatry.\nOf the surveyed sample, 41.8% had scores on HADStress that correlate to posttraumatic stress disorder.

This reality challenges practitioners to work according to guidelines that may not be sufficiently relevant and challenges ethics reviewers to apply frameworks not intended for the subspecialties. This article offers the theoretical and practical support to amend APA Procedures to permit formal consideration of subspecialty ethics during ethics complaints and to include forensic practitioners on panels reviewing them. This is the first step toward an integration of two conflicting models of ethics enforcement, regulatory and aspirational, that bring together specialty and subspecialty ethics."}, {"Title": "Open access journals and forensic publishing.", "Abstract": "Open access (OA) publishing makes articles available over the Internet at no charge. The OA movement had its official start in 2002 with the establishment of the Budapest Open Access Initiative. The goal of the OA movement is to remove access barriers, accelerate research, and thereby achieve its broader mission of promoting global welfare. The OA movement has made swift progress over the past decade, but has introduced a disruptive change into the scientific community. The early stages of OA publishing have raised strong apprehensions, such as reliability concerns and the emergence of so-called predatory journals. The OA initiative is both inspiring and unsettling. For the discipline of forensic psychiatry, research findings must be reliable enough to be proffered as testimony in court. The methods used by OA publishing make the resolution of the reliability problem somewhat unclear. Nevertheless, given the momentum of OA publishing, a substantial change in traditional publishing appears inevitable. The discipline of forensic psychiatry must keep abreast of this change and find innovative methods of preserving the integrity of the forensic science database."}, {"Title": "Peer review to ensure quality in forensic mental health publication.", "Abstract": "Peer reviewers have been called the gatekeepers of science.

In this review of articles, we make the first known attempt at a systematic comparison of an academic journal's content areas to national standardized educational indices for physicians. Findings from the 2008 to 2012 content of The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law demonstrated that The Journal's articles cover the gamut of board certification examination topics, although content areas are not weighted in parallel with the examination.

Comparing outcomes according to continuous and categorical outcome indicators using real-life data of seven mental healthcare providers, three using the Child Behavior Checklist and four using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire as primary outcome measure. Within each dataset consistent differences were found between providers and the various methods led to comparable rankings of providers. Statistical considerations designate continuous outcomes as the optimal choice. Change scores have more statistical power and allow for a ranking of providers at first glance.

The ability to organize information in ways that facilitate the generation of effective diagnostic solutions is a distinguishing characteristic of expert physicians, suggesting that automated systems that organize clinical information in a similar manner may augment physicians' decision-making capabilities. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of a theoretically driven cognitive support system (CSS) that assists psychiatrists in their interpretation of clinical cases. The system highlights, and provides the means to navigate to, text that is organized in accordance with a set of diagnostically and therapeutically meaningful higher-level concepts.\nTo evaluate the interface, 16 psychiatry residents interpreted two clinical case scenarios, with and without the CSS. Think-aloud protocols captured during their interpretation of the cases were transcribed and analyzed qualitatively. In addition, the frequency and relative position of content related to key higher-level concepts in a verbal summary of the case were evaluated. In addition the transcripts from both groups were compared to an expert derived reference standard using latent semantic analysis (LSA).\nQualitative analysis showed that users of the system better attended to specific clinically important aspects of both cases when these were highlighted by the system, and revealed ways in which the system mediates hypotheses generation and evaluation. Analysis of the summary data showed differences in emphasis with and without the system. The LSA analysis suggested users of the system were more \"expert-like\" in their emphasis, and that cognitive support was more effective in the more complex case.\nCognitive support impacts upon clinical comprehension. This appears to be largely helpful, but may also lead to neglect of information (such as the psychosocial history) that the system does not highlight. The results have implications for the design of CSSs for clinical narratives including the role of information organization and textual embellishments for more efficient clinical case presentation and comprehension."}, {"Title": "Monoamine-sensitive developmental periods impacting adult emotional and cognitive behaviors.", "Abstract": "Development passes through sensitive periods, during which plasticity allows for genetic and environmental factors to exert indelible influence on the maturation of the organism. In the context of central nervous system development, such sensitive periods shape the formation of neurocircuits that mediate, regulate, and control behavior. This general mechanism allows for development to be guided by both the genetic blueprint as well as the environmental context. While allowing for adaptation, such sensitive periods are also vulnerability windows during which external and internal factors can confer risk to disorders by derailing otherwise resilient developmental programs. Here we review developmental periods that are sensitive to monoamine signaling and impact adult behaviors of relevance to psychiatry. Specifically, we review (1) a serotonin-sensitive period that impacts sensory system development, (2) a serotonin-sensitive period that impacts cognition, anxiety- and depression-related behaviors, and (3) a dopamine- and serotonin-sensitive period affecting aggression, impulsivity and behavioral response to psychostimulants. We discuss preclinical data to provide mechanistic insight, as well as epidemiological and clinical data to point out translational relevance. The field of translational developmental neuroscience has progressed exponentially providing solid conceptual advances and unprecedented mechanistic insight. With such knowledge at hand and important methodological innovation ongoing, the field is poised for breakthroughs elucidating the developmental origins of neuropsychiatric disorders, and thus understanding pathophysiology. Such knowledge of sensitive periods that determine the developmental trajectory of complex behaviors is a necessary step towards improving prevention and treatment approaches for neuropsychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "The diminished pipeline for medications to treat mental health and substance use disorders.", "Abstract": "Psychotropic drug development is perceived to be lagging behind other pharmaceutical development, even though there is a need for more effective psychotropic medications. This study examined the state of the current psychotropic drug pipeline and potential barriers to psychotropic drug development.\nThe authors scanned the recent academic and \"grey\" literature to evaluate psychotropic drug development and to identify experts in the fields of psychiatry and substance use disorder treatment and psychotropic drug development. On the basis of that preliminary research, the authors interviewed six experts and analyzed drugs being studied for treatment of major psychiatric disorders in phase III clinical trials.\nInterviews and review of clinical trials of drugs in phase III of development confirmed that the psychotropic pipeline is slim and that a majority of the drugs in phase III trials are not very innovative. Among the barriers to development are incentives that encourage firms to focus on incremental innovation rather than take risks on radically new approaches. Other barriers include human brain complexity, failure of animal trials to translate well to human trials, and a drug approval threshold that is perceived as so high that it discourages development.\nDrivers of innovation in psychotropic drug development largely parallel those for other drugs, yet crucial distinctions have led to slowing psychotropic development after a period of innovation and growth. Various factors have acted to dry up the pipeline for psychotropic drugs, with expert opinion suggesting that in the near term, this trend is likely to continue."}, {"Title": "Testimonies of precognition and encounters with psychiatry in letters to J.

Priestley in 1963, this paper explores the intersection between patient-focused history of psychiatry and the history of parapsychology in everyday life. Priestley's study of precognition lay outside the main currents of parapsychology, and his status as a storyteller encouraged confidences about anomalous temporal experience and mental illness. Drawing on virtue epistemology, I explore the regulation of subjectivity operated by Priestley in establishing the credibility of his correspondents in relation to their gender and mental health, and investigate the possibility of testimonial justice for these witnesses. Priestley's ambivalent approach to madness in relation to visions of the future is related to the longer history of prophecy and madness. Letters from the television audience reveal a variety of attitudes towards the compatibility of precognition with modern theories of the mind, show the flexibility of precognition in relation to mental distress, and record a range of responses from medical and therapeutic practitioners. Testimonial justice for those whose experience of precognition intersects with psychiatric care entails a full acknowledgement of the tensions and complicities between these two domains as they are experienced by the witness, and an explicit statement of the hearer's orientation to those domains."}, {"Title": "Assessment and determinants of aggression in a forensic psychiatric institution in Hong Kong, China.", "Abstract": "Institutional aggression in forensic psychiatric setting is an under-researched subject, despite the magnitude of the problem.

Data of 1423 children and adolescents who presented in 2003 regarding the waiting time for the first appointment and the rate of nonattendance at the first appointment were used for the comparison. In triage system, new patients presenting to the outpatient clinic in the morning four days a week were assessed by a three-stage procedure: An initial Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire screening and a structured interview administered by an intern was then followed by a clinical interview.\nOf the 1482 children and adolescents who presented to the outpatient clinic during the study period, 1291 were given further appointments. Among patients who presented in 2005, the 207 non-attendant patients were significantly more likely to have longer waiting times than the 1084 attendant patients. When compared to year 2003, it was found that there was a significant decrease in the median waiting time for the first appointment and the rate of nonattendance at the first appointment among patients who presented in 2005.\nThe triage procedure used in this study may constitute a model for developing countries with limited health care resources."}, {"Title": "Association Between Age at Onset of Schizophrenia and Age at Menarche.", "Abstract": "Increasing evidence from clinical practice, as well as from epidemiological and basic research shows that there are gender differences in clinical features of schizophrenia, and this may be related to estrogens. There may be a relationship between earlier puberty and later onset of the disease, because of the protective effects of estrogens in women with schizophrenia. In this study, our aim was to analyze the correlation between age of menarche and age of onset of schizophrenia and to investigate the protective effects of estrogens in schizophrenia.\nIn this study, we included 289 patients who were diagnosed with schizophrenia. Those with mental deficiency or organic brain disorders were excluded from the study. All subjects were given a socio-demographic form to determine their personal information, age at menarche, age at first odd behavior, age at onset of the disease and first hospitalization. Data on factors which may affect the association between age at onset of schizophrenia and age at menarche such as family history, head or birth trauma etc. were recorded on the information form.\nWe found out that age at menarche was negatively associated with age at first odd behavior and age at first psychotic symptoms.\nOur study verifies the protective effects of estrogens and shows that the earlier puberty may be the cause of later onset of schizophrenia.

Currently, diagnoses of these disorders rely on interview-based assessments of subjective self-reported symptoms. Early diagnosis is difficult, misdiagnosis is a frequent occurrence and there are no objective tests that aid in the prediction of individual responses to treatment. Consequently, validated biomarkers are urgently needed to help address these unmet clinical needs. Historically, psychiatric disorders are viewed as brain disorders and consequently only a few researchers have as yet evaluated systemic changes in psychiatric patients. However, promising research has begun to challenge this concept and there is an increasing awareness that disease-related changes can be traced in the peripheral system which may even be involved in the precipitation of disease onset and course. Converging evidence from molecular profiling analysis of blood serum/plasma have revealed robust molecular changes in psychiatric patients, suggesting that these disorders may be detectable in other systems of the body such as the circulating blood. In this review, we discuss the current clinical needs in psychiatry, highlight the importance of biomarkers in the field, and review a representative selection of biomarker studies to highlight opportunities for the implementation of personalized medicine approaches in the field of psychiatry. It is anticipated that the implementation of validated biomarker tests will not only improve the diagnosis and more effective treatment of psychiatric patients, but also improve prognosis and disease outcome."}, {"Title": "Comparison of personality beliefs between depressed patients and healthy controls.", "Abstract": "According to the cognitive model, the common mechanism underlying all psychological disorders is distorted or dysfunctional thoughts that affect mood and behaviors. Dysfunctional thoughts predispose an individual to depression and are among the processes that form the basis of personality traits. Elucidating the personality beliefs associated with depression and dysfunctional thoughts is important to understanding and treating depression. The aim of the present study is to determine whether depressed patients exhibited pathological personality beliefs compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, we investigated which personality beliefs were more common among such depressed patients.\nA total of 70 patients who were admitted to the Department of Psychiatry at Ankara Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital (Ankara, Turkey) and diagnosed with major depressive disorder according to The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria were included in the study. Additionally, 70 healthy controls matched for age, marital status, and education were included in the study. The Sociodemographic Data Form and Personality Belief Questionnaire-Short form (PBQ-SF) were administered to the participants.\nA comparison of the depression group with the healthy controls revealed higher scores in dependent, passive-aggressive, obsessive-compulsive, antisocial, histrionic, paranoid, borderline, and avoidant personality subscales in the depressive group.\nThese results suggest that personality beliefs at the pathological level are more common in depressive patients and that the detection of these beliefs would be useful for predicting the prognosis of the disease and determining appropriate treatment methods."}, {"Title": "Integrating early life experience, gene expression, brain development, and emergent phenotypes: unraveling the thread of nature via nurture.", "Abstract": "Adaptation to environmental changes is based on the perpetual generation of new phenotypes. Modern biology has focused on the role of epigenetic mechanisms in facilitating the adaptation of organisms to changing environments through alterations in gene expression. Inherited and/or acquired epigenetic factors are relatively stable and have regulatory roles in numerous genomic activities that translate into phenotypic outcomes. Evidence that dietary and pharmacological interventions have the potential to reverse environment-induced modification of epigenetic states (e.g., early life experience, nutrition, medication, infection) has provided an additional stimulus for understanding the biological basis of individual differences in cognitive abilities and disorders of the brain. It has been suggested that accurate quantification of the relative contribution of heritable genetic and epigenetic variation is essential for understanding phenotypic divergence and adaptation in changing environments, a process requiring stable modulation of gene expression. The main challenge for epigenetics in psychology and psychiatry is to determine how experiences and environmental cues, including the nature of our nurture, influence the expression of neuronal genes to produce long-term individual differences in behavior, cognition, personality, and mental health. To this end, focusing on DNA and histone modifications and their initiators, mediators and readers may provide new inroads for understanding the molecular basis of phenotypic plasticity and disorders of the brain. In this chapter, we review recent discoveries highlighting epigenetic aspects of normal brain development and mental illness, as well as discuss some future directions in the field of behavioral epigenetics."}, {"Title": "Repetitive elements and epigenetic marks in behavior and psychiatric disease.", "Abstract": "Repetitive elements, which are relics of previous transposition events, constitute a large proportion of the human genome. The ability of transposons to gives rise to new DNA combinations has clearly provided an evolutionary advantage to their hosts. Transposons have shaped our genomes by giving rise to novel coding sequences, alternative gene promoters, conserved noncoding elements, and gene networks. Despite its benefits, the process of transposition can also create deleterious DNA combinations, and a growing number of human diseases are being linked to abnormal repetitive element activity. To limit transposition, cells tightly regulate and immobilize repetitive elements using DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks. Recent findings in neuropsychiatric disorders implicate both repetitive elements and epigenetic marks as potential etiological factors. It is possible that these observations are linked and that the reported alterations in epigenetic marks may create a permissive state enabling transposons to mobilize. In this work, we provide a detailed description of repetitive element biology and epigenetics to familiarize the readers with the subject matter and to illustrate how their disruption can result in pathology. We also review the evidence for the involvement of these two factors in neuropsychiatric disorders and discuss the need for replication studies to confirm these initial findings. We are cautiously optimistic that further characterization of epigenetic mark and repetitive element activity in the brain will reveal the underlying causes of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression."}, {"Title": "Objective QbTest and subjective evaluation of stimulant treatment in adult attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "To evaluate the QbTest as an objective measure versus self-reported ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) before and during stimulant treatment in adults with ADHD.\nWe used the subjective ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS), and the objective computerized QbTest, which is a 20-minute unconditional identical pairs test that measures attention, impulsivity, and also hyperactivity using a motion-tracking system. Patients were assessed before (baseline) and during medical treatment with stimulants (follow-up) in an observational study design.\nData of n=145 patients at baseline and n=82 patients at follow-up were analyzed. There were significant symptom reductions on all symptom domains, but correlations between the tests were weak. Improvement on the QbTest was independent of the patient's age, gender, educational level, ADHD subtype, co-morbid disorders, and use of other medications. Patients with worst QbTest results at baseline showed most improvement at follow-up. The QbTest was more sensitive to medication effects than the ADHD-RS. QbTest objectified clinical significant medication effect in 54% of patients who subjectively did not report any clinical effects.\nSymptoms dimensions of objective and subjective tests refer to different psychological constructs.\nThe QbTest is a valuable addition to existing subjective measures to assess medication effects in ADHD patients who have difficulties reporting treatment effects."}, {"Title": "Anabolic androgenic steroids and violent offending: confounding by polysubstance abuse among 10,365 general population men.", "Abstract": "Anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) use is associated with aggressive and violent behaviour, but it remains uncertain if this relationship is causal in humans.

Current views suggest that astrocytes:(1) are excitable through calcium fluctuations and respond to neurotransmitters released at synapses; (2) communicate with each other via calcium waves and release their own gliotransmitters which are essential for synaptic plasticity; (3) activate hundreds of synapses at once, thereby synchronizing neuronal activity and activating or inhibiting complete neuronal networks; (4) release vasoactive substances to the smooth muscle surrounding blood vessels enabling the coupling of circulation (blood flow) to local brain activity; and (5) release lactate in an activity-dependent manner in order to supply neuronal metabolic demand. In consequence, the role of astrocytes and astrocytic gliotransmitters is now believed to be critical for higher brain function and recently, evidence begins to gather suggesting that astrocytes are pivotal for learning and memory.

Understanding the psychometric properties of fMRI-based metrics, and the factors that influence them, will be critical for properly interpreting the results of these efforts. The current study examined whether the choice among alternative model specifications affects estimates of test-retest reliability in key emotion processing regions across a 6-month interval. Subjects (N\u200a=\u200a46) performed an emotional-faces paradigm during fMRI in which neutral faces dynamically morphed into one of four emotional faces. Median voxelwise intraclass correlation coefficients (mvICCs) were calculated to examine stability over time in regions showing task-related activity as well as in bilateral amygdala. Four modeling choices were evaluated: a default model that used the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF), a flexible HRF model that included additional basis functions, a modified CompCor (mCompCor) model that added corrections for physiological noise in the global signal, and a final model that combined the flexible HRF and mCompCor models. Model residuals were examined to determine the degree to which each pipeline met modeling assumptions. Results indicated that the choice of modeling approaches impacts both the degree to which model assumptions are met and estimates of test-retest reliability. ICC estimates in the visual cortex increased from poor (mvICC\u200a=\u200a0.31) in the default pipeline to fair (mvICC\u200a=\u200a0.45) in the full alternative pipeline - an increase of 45%.

Few studies evaluating treatment have been published and most studies are follow-up studies with methodological limitations and little comparability across studies.\nThe purpose of the PhD is to characterize transcultural trauma patients in Denmark needing psychiatric treatment with regards to psychopathology and predictors of mental health and to evaluate the effects of the treatment.\nTwo studies reported in 4 papers form the basis of the thesis. FORLOB (Paper 1-3) was a follow-up study that included all patients receiving treatment at the Competence Center for Transcultural Psychiatry in Copenhagen from April 2008 to February 2010. Patients completed self-ratings of symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety as well as level of functioning and quality of life (HTQ, HSCL-25, SDS & WHO-5) before treatment and after treatment. Associations of co-morbid diagnoses and predictors of the patients' health condition were examined with linear and logistic regression and Pearson's correlation coefficients. Treatment in FORLOB consisted of a combination of Sertraline, Mianserin, psycho-education and Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TFCBT). The treatment administered to each patient was monitored in detail and changes in outcome and predictors of change were analyzed. PTF1 (Paper 4) was a randomized controlled clinical trial with 2x2 factorial design (antidepressants, TFCBT, antidepressants & TFCBT, waiting list). Potential participants were screened amongst adult patients referred to the Competence Center for Transcultural Psychiatry in the period June 2009-2011. Patients with PTSD, war trauma and without a psychotic disorder were included. The manualized treatment consisted of weekly sessions with a physician and/or psychologist over a period of 6 months. The treatment effect was evaluated with a combination of self-ratings and blinded and non-blinded observer ratings. Outcome measures included symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, pain and somatization, quality of life and level of functioning (HTQ, HSCL-25, SCL-90, WHO-5, SDS, VAS, Hamilton, GAF). Treatment was offered with translation and screening instruments were translated to the six most common languages in the patient group covering the needs of 92% of patients.\nIn FORLOB, patients had several co-morbidities and not just PTSD. Almost all patients had depression, pain and untreated somatic complaints in addition to PTSD. Furthermore, 36-58% had physical problems they were in treatment for, 9-16% of patients had psychotic symptoms mainly related to their trauma, 27% had enduring personality change due to catastrophic events according to ICD-10 and 46% reported traumatic brain injury. Patients reporting chronic pain had higher symptom scores on HSCL-25 and HTQ and patients with psychotic symptoms scored higher on all symptom clusters on HTQ. At pre-treatment assessment, the patients' level of functioning and quality of life were very low, the majority of patients lived on public subsidies, education levels were low and most patients had a limited social network. In FORLOB, we found a moderate significant change (Cohen's d 0.44-0.67) on all self-report outcome measures (HTQ, HSCL-25, SDS and WHO-5) after combination treatment. We found less improvement in PTSD when patients were receiving public subsidies and less improvement of depression when patients reported pain in the upper extremities. We found a positive association between systematic use of CBT methods and improvement in patient condition. In PTF1, the randomized clinical trial, we found a small, but significant effect of treatment with medicine on blinded observer-ratings of depression and anxiety (Ham-D and Ham-A) and a large effect on non-blinded ratings of level of functioning (GAF-F and GAF-S), in addition to a small effect on self-reported level of functioning and headache (SDS and VAS). Cohen's d calculated as the differences between randomization groups receiving medicine and not receiving medicine ranged from 0.91-1.01 on GAF-F and GAF-S, whereas on the other ratings showing significant change Cohen's d was 0.31-0.41. We did not find any effect of psychotherapy on any outcomes nor any effect of psycho-therapy or medicine on the primary outcome measure, PTSD.\nTraditionally, treatment of traumatized refugees have focused on PTSD, but this study demonstrates that patients suffer from numerous psychiatric and somatic co-morbidities and the comprehensiveness of PTSD in explaining symptoms of traumatized refugees is questionable. This has implications for the type and implementation of treatment. PTF1 is the largest randomized clinical trial published on the treatment of traumatized refugees. It is a strength of PTF1 that it includes a waiting list control group thereby accounting for any effects due to spontaneous recovery and that treatment modalities are examined separately and in combination. In both FORLOB and PTF1, treatment adherence and patient compliance with treatment was thoroughly documented. Effect sizes were moderate in FORLOB and small in PTF1. There were discrepancies between the results in FORLOB and PTF1 with regards to the effect measured on self-ratings that can only partially be explained by methodological limitations of the follow-up study. Both studies are undertaken under pragmatic and realistic circumstances and the results are therefore relevant to other contexts. Patients are representative of patients in other North-European studies of traumatized refugees but differ from patients in trials published on culturally adapted CBT and Narrative Exposure Therapy."}, {"Title": "Psychogenic hiccup in children and adolescents: a case series.", "Abstract": "Hiccups can be due to organic diseases or psychogenic causes.

Training program length, limited treatments, and insufficient clerkship exposure were noted as deterrents to choosing psychiatry, though future job prospects, the growing role of neuroscience, and diagnostic complexity positively influenced choosing psychiatry as a specialty. Research and elective time away opportunities were deemed relatively unimportant to ranking decisions, compared with more highly weighted factors, such as program flexibility, emphasis on psychotherapy, service- training balance, and training program location. Most applicants also reported continuing to fine tune ranking decisions between the application and ranking submission deadline.\nStigma, exposure to psychiatry, diagnostic complexity, and an encouraging job market were highlighted as positive influences on the choice to enter psychiatry residency.

Drawing on data from research on the role of culture in psychiatric services in the Boston area, this paper critically examines the attribution of a 'culture' to psychiatry, which is prevalent not simply in mainstream psychiatric literature, but also in certain lines of cultural psychiatry, specifically those dedicated to political and anti-racist activism. It is argued that the use of such terminology could be misleading as it implicitly attributes a sense of coherence and agency to what may best be described as a set of related discourses and sociopolitical practices. It is further suggested that, given the implications of using such terminology as 'culture' in our discussions of psychiatry as a social institution, a scientific discourse, or a clinical practice, it would be more fruitful to address the analytic concepts of power, meaning, and the sociopolitical functions of psychiatry instead."}, {"Title": "A conceptual framework for the neurobiological study of resilience.", "Abstract": "The well-replicated observation that many people maintain mental health despite exposure to severe psychological or physical adversity has ignited interest in the mechanisms that protect against stress-related mental illness. Focusing on resilience rather than pathophysiology in many ways represents a paradigm shift in clinical-psychological and psychiatric research that has great potential for the development of new prevention and treatment strategies. More recently, research into resilience also arrived in the neurobiological community, posing nontrivial questions about ecological validity and translatability. Drawing on concepts and findings from transdiagnostic psychiatry, emotion research, and behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, we propose a unified theoretical framework for the neuroscientific study of general resilience mechanisms. The framework is applicable to both animal and human research and supports the design and interpretation of translational studies. The theory emphasizes the causal role of stimulus appraisal (evaluation) processes in the generation of emotional responses, including responses to potential stressors. On this basis, it posits that a positive (non-negative) appraisal style is the key mechanism that protects against the detrimental effects of stress and mediates the effects of other known resilience factors. Appraisal style is shaped by three classes of cognitive processes--positive situation classification, reappraisal, and interference inhibition--that can be investigated at the neural level.

Despite rigorous clinical research demonstrating its equivalence and effectiveness relative to face-to-face care, many providers are unfamiliar with this technology. Training residents in telepsychiatry is critical to building mental health care capacity in rural and underserviced communities. However, many questions remain regarding the competencies that future psychiatrists require with respect to telepsychiatry, and technology generally, and regarding pedagogical approaches that will promote their attainment. This literature review aims to elucidate evidence-based approaches to developing residents' competence to practice telepsychiatry.\nThe authors conducted a literature search of telepsychiatry training for psychiatry residents. The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane, and ERIC using subject headings and keywords; and hand searched reference lists, forward citations of relevant articles, and tables of contents of relevant journals. Articles were included if they were in English, discussed teaching psychiatry residents to provide direct or indirect clinical care via real-time videoconferencing technology, and were published by January 2014.\nIn total, 215 unique references yielded 20 relevant publications. The literature on graduate training in telepsychiatry is sparse, heterogeneous, and primarily descriptive. Even brief learning experiences may increase the likelihood that residents will incorporate telepsychiatry into their future practice. Training should address competencies that are (1) technical, (2) collaborative/interprofessional, and (3) administrative. Training typically consists of supervised provision of clinical care to build modality-specific clinical skills and may also include didactic teaching to provide health systems and transcultural and medicolegal perspectives.\nA more evidence-based approach to telepsychiatry training is needed, including an assessment of residents' learning needs, use of multiple learning modalities, and evaluations of educational curricula.

These features constitute the dimensions or categories for a profile of brain disorders based upon pathophysiology. The second section describes a mapping or translation matrix that maps from symptoms and signs, of a descriptive sort, to the CBP dimensions that provide a more mechanistic explanation. We will describe how this mapping engenders archetypal diagnoses, referring readers to tables and figures. The third section addresses the construct validity of clinical brain profiling by establishing correlations between profiles based on clinical ratings of symptoms and signs under classical diagnostic categories with the corresponding profiles generated automatically using archetypal diagnoses. We then provide further validation by performing a cluster analysis on the symptoms and signs and showing how they correspond to the equivalent brain profiles based upon clinical and automatic diagnosis. In the fourth section, we address the construct validity of clinical brain profiling by looking for associations between pathophysiological mechanisms (such as connectivity and plasticity) and nosological diagnoses (such as schizophrenia and depression). Based upon the mechanistic perspective offered in the first section, we test some particular hypotheses about double dissociations using a meta-analysis of PubMed searches. The final section concludes with perspectives for the future and outstanding validation issues for clinical brain profiling."}, {"Title": "Prescription of psychotropic drugs in patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis.", "Abstract": "Patients on hemodialysis commonly have comorbid depression and require treatment with psychotropic drugs. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of the use of psychotropic drugs among patients on hemodialysis and to elucidate the factors associated with use of each class of psychotropic medication.\nThis cross-sectional study enrolled 195 hemodialysis patients with a mean age of 58.5 years. Patients were assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Chalder Fatigue Scale and Short-form Health-related Quality of Life. We analyzed the frequency of psychiatric outpatient department visits within six months prior to interview and psychotropic drugs use within one month prior to interview, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines (BZDs) and hypnotics.\nOf the 195 patients, 47 (24.1%) fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Only 6.4% of patients diagnosed with MDD visited the psychiatry outpatient department within six months prior to interview. Of the total patients, the proportions with use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, BZDs and hypnotics were 5.6%, 1.0%, 3.1%, 42.6% and 20.0%, respectively. Having MDD was an independent factor associated with taking antidepressants (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20093.98, p\u2009=\u20090.036) and taking hypnotics (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20092.75, p\u2009=\u20090.011).\nDepression is generally undetected or not well-managed among hemodialysis patients in the clinical setting. Only a small proportion of depressed patients received antidepressant treatment. BZDs and/or hypnotics might be exorbitantly prescribed. Clinicians should pay more attention to patients' emotional distress and provide appropriate treatment."}, {"Title": "[Epidemiological study of psychiatric hospitalizations in general hospital Bjelovar].", "Abstract": "Summary. Based on the data provided by the Registry of the Department of Psychiatry, General Hospital Bjelovar, an epidemiological study of the hospital treated patients for the years 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 was made. In determining the diagnostic groups, the authors used the International Classification of Diseases ICD-10 and the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations, adjusting all diagnostic entities to that classification. The study sample consists of patients hospitalized at the Department of Psychiatry, General Hospital Bjelovar in the years mentioned above. Following parameters were analyzed: total number of hospitalizations, gender, age and hospitalization outcome--by diagnostic groups. What is noted is the decrease in the total number of psychiatric hospitalizations, the reduction of the proportion of men and women in the sample, and the decrease of mortality. In the observed period, the number of hospitalized patients diagnosed as alcoholics decreased, and the number of patients hospitalized with diagnosed as alcoholics decreased, and the number of patients hospitalized with diagnosed dementia, affective disorders, and critical conditions increased, while the number of the hospitalized schizophrenic patients has been oscillating. The main differences between the results of the initial and final year of the epidemiological study have been analyzed by the chi square test.

Type of AP, dosage, and concomitant medication were registered at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after beginning the treatment with AP.\nAt baseline, the patients' mean age was 14.4 (2.9) years, and 145 (54.7%) patients were males. Antipsychotics were more prescribed in the following: schizophrenia spectrum disorders (30.2%), disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) (18.9%), bipolar disorders (14.3%), depressive disorders (12.8%), and eating disorders (11.7%). A total of 93.2% of the patients were on an off-label indication of AP. Risperidone was the AP most prescribed in all the assessments, but differences were observed in the type of AP according to diagnosis. Thus, risperidone was significantly most prescribed in patients with DBD and olanzapine was most prescribed in patients with eating disorders. Olanzapine and quetiapine were the second-generation APs (SGAs) most prescribed after risperidone, and haloperidol was the most prescribed first-generation AP. Up to 8.3% of patients during the follow-up were on AP polypharmacy. Almost 16% patients had a change in its AP treatment during the follow-up, and the main switch was from one SGA to another.\nSecond-generation APs were the APs most prescribed in our sample and approximately 93% of the patients used AP off-label. Risperidone was the most common AP used above all in patients with DBD, whereas olanzapine was most prescribed in patients with eating disorders.

Contemporary subjective distress is rooted in these last two areas. It is important to consider that social and cultural factors are relevant in the process of subjectivity, that is, the way desire and fantasy are arranged. Therefore, the modifications in subjectivity generate new spatialities and temporalities. Space and time are not simply physical containers of human action but represent, at once, the container and contents of social practices. The fact that subjects are present at birth as both actors and carriers of institutions constitutes the foundation of these institutions in relation to subjectivity. The relational frames in which the subject is immersed are never a single element, but they express joint successive institutional and social spheres. The challenge is to think current demand differently, not only in the way it should be addressed, but mainly by the different characteristics of how subjectivity and the nature of social representations are expressed. Nowadays a clinical procedure that only takes into account the social factor is not enough - a clinical procedure for a social and interactive subject is required. The objective is to build a historicized subjectivity to enable taking action on the present. New social realities affect our clinical practice and form a new social and cultural context that forces us to reflect on these changes and think about the necessary adjustments in our practice and knowledge."}, {"Title": "[The cultural psychiatry in Latin America].", "Abstract": "This paper presents only some of the most important contributions in the development of cultural psychiatry in Latin America.

Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a potent antioxidant, which protects against lipid peroxidation. The study aimed to examine the relation between TRAP levels and PON1 activity, PON1 Q192R functional genotypes, smoking, interactions between PON1 genotypes and smoking, and mood disorders, while adjusting for effects of ethnicity, marital status, body mass index (BMI) and gender. The analyses were performed in 197 controls and 136 subjects with mood disorders. TRAP levels were significantly associated with higher plasma PON1 activity, the RR functional genotype, non smoking by RR carriers, male gender and a higher BMI. TRAP levels were significantly lower in patients with mood disorders than in controls, but this association was no longer significant after considering the effects of the above predictors. The risk in the subgroup with low TRAP levels is increased by a smoking X RR genotype interaction and decreased by male gender, the RR genotype, and higher BMI and PON1 activity. Plasma PON1 activity, the PON1 Q192R functional genotypes and specific interactions between this genotype and smoking contribute significantly to TRAP levels.

Otherwise, respondents were largely unable to label orthodox psychiatry syndromes correctly. Supernatural and ultra-human views were rampant, and alternative mental health services were mostly preferred. Quantitative modes of assessment were the most common, and authors-especially those that adopted this mode of assessment-did not take full cognizance of socio-cultural underpinnings of the concept of mental health literacy in their conclusion and recommendations.\nThere is need for more studies to adopt more comprehensive approaches to the assessment of mental health literacy.

Recent neurobiological approaches have focused on, especially, the abnormal contents of consciousness, the \"substantive parts\" as James said, to associate them with the neural mechanisms related to sensory, motor, and cognitive functions, and the brain's underlying stimulus-induced or task-evoked activity. This leaves open, however, the neural mechanisms that provide the temporal linkage or glue between the various contents, the transitive parts that makes possible the \"stream of consciousness.\" Interestingly, schizophrenic patients seem to suffer from abnormalities specifically in the \"transitive parts\" when they experience contents as temporally disconnected or fragmented which in phenomenological psychiatry has been described as \"temporal fragmentation.\" The aim of this article is to develop so-called neurophenomenal hypothesis about the direct relationship between phenomenal features of the \"stream of consciousness,\" the \"transitive parts,\" and the specific neuronal mechanisms in schizophrenia as based on healthy subjects. Rather than emphasizing stimulus-induced and task-evoked activity and sensory and lateral prefrontal cortical regions as in neurocognitive approaches with their focus on the \"substantive parts,\" the focus shifts here to the brain's intrinsic activity, its resting state activity, which may account for the temporal linkage or glue between the contents of consciousness, the transitive parts."}, {"Title": "Epidemic of Koro in North East India: an observational cross-sectional study.", "Abstract": "Koro is a culture bound syndrome, endemic in South-East Asia.

It has a distinct mechanism of action relative to other anti-anxiety agents (\u03b12\u03b4 binding at presynaptic voltage dependent calcium channels leading to inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission), a rapid onset of effect (typically \u22641\u00a0week) and broad spectrum activity against both the psychic and somatic symptoms of GAD. In long-term studies, pregabalin maintained improvements in anxiety symptoms that occurred in response to short-term treatment and delayed the time to relapse of GAD compared with placebo. Common comorbidities of GAD, such as insomnia, gastrointestinal symptoms and subsyndromal depression, have no effect on the anxiolytic efficacy of, and moreover are specifically improved by, pregabalin. Treatment with pregabalin is generally well tolerated; the drug has an adverse event profile that includes dizziness, somnolence and weight gain. The potential for abuse of pregabalin is low; the risk of withdrawal symptoms is generally low when the drug is discontinued gradually (over 1\u00a0week).

We provide a concise overview of the methodologic approaches that have the capacity to rapidly increase knowledge and change practice, which have been successful in past work in psychiatry and other areas of medicine. We suggest three specific pathways to advance knowledge of suicide risk factors and prevention. First, analysis of large-scale epidemiologic surveys and administrative data sets can advance the understanding of suicide. Second, given the low base rate of suicide, there is a need for networks/consortia of investigators in the field of suicide prevention. Such consortia have the capacity to analyze existing epidemiologic data sets, create multi-site cohort studies of high-risk groups to increase knowledge of biological and other risk factors, and create a platform for multi-site clinical trials. Third, partnerships with policymakers and researchers would facilitate careful scientific evaluation of policies and programs aimed at reducing suicide. Suicide intervention policies are often multifaceted, expensive, and rarely evaluated. Using quasi-experimental methods or sophisticated analytic strategies such as propensity score-matching techniques, the impact of large-scale interventions on suicide can be evaluated. Furthermore, such partnerships between policymakers and researchers can lead to the design and support of prospective RCTs (e.g., cluster randomized trials, stepped wedge designs, waiting list designs) in high-risk groups (e.g., people with a history of suicide attempts, multi-axial comorbidity, and offspring of people who have died by suicide).

The article argues that now forgotten German-Japanese exchanges in the field of psychiatric pathology, together with the historical development of psychiatric care, were central mechanisms for the establishment of a distinctly psychiatric discourse in Japan priot to its broad institutionalization. Three discursive strategies were key: Japanese and German experts from a range of medical fields reinvented a body of traditions loosely related to actual pre-modern cultural practices; they engaged in comparative evaluations of psychiatric conditions; and, through the simple but effective transformation of specific concepts and termini at the margins of European psychiatry, these experts contributed to the transfer not only of a psychiatric discourse but also affected the power relations on a national and international scale as European psychiatry permeated into new territory, namely the Japanese landscape of emerging modern scientific disciplines."}, {"Title": "Prevalence of psychiatric morbidities in acute coronary heart disease.", "Abstract": "Introduction. Psychiatric problems and stresses may deteriorate the prognosis of patients with IHD. So evaluating their frequency possibly will promote our perspective regarding their vital importance in the field of consultation-liaison psychiatry. Method and Materials. One hundred and one (101) patients with IHD were interviewed in CCU of a general hospital by a psychiatrist to find whether there was any relationship between cardiac events and psychiatric problems or stresses. Results. Cardiac events were significantly more prevalent among patients with both psychiatric problems and biological risk factors (P < 0.05). Also, the number of patients suffering from psychiatric problems was significantly more than cases without that (P < 0.05). There was a significant difference between male and female patients regarding the type of stress (P < 0.01). 79% of total stresses were experienced by patients who had as well psychiatric problems (P < 0.0001). In addition, there was significantly more dysthymic disorder in the acute group of patients in comparison with major or minor depressive disorder in the chronic group (P < 0.001). Conclusion. The high prevalence of psychiatric problems and psychosocial stresses among patients with IHD deserves sufficient attention by clinicians for detection, monitoring, and management of them."}, {"Title": "Enucleation of eye using finger following cannabis consumption: a case report.", "Abstract": "Enucleation is a topic discussed in psychiatry which is a self-injury matter.

So far, most of the explanations of the phenomenon have focused on the process of medicalization, but little attention has been cast towards physicians' day-to-day clinical reasoning, and the way it affects therapeutic decision-making. This article addresses the complex relationship between aetiology, diagnosis and drug treatment by examining the style of reasoning underlying prescribing practices through an historical lens. A genealogy of contemporary prescribing practices is proposed, that draws significant comparisons between 19th-century medicine and modern psychiatry. Tensions between specific, standardized cures and specific, idiosyncratic patients have been historically at play in clinical reasoning - and still are today. This inquiry into the epistemological foundations of contemporary drug prescription reveals an underlying search for scientific legitimacy."}, {"Title": "[Delusional infestation, a therapeutic challenge].", "Abstract": "Delusional infestation, formally known as delusional parasitosis, poses a therapeutic challenge.

We present two men aged 49 and 48 who saw the dermatologist with skin symptoms due to primary and secondary delusional infestation, respectively. Despite their anosognosia, both patients were successfully treated with antipsychotics thanks to the collaboration between dermatology and psychiatry. To increase the acceptability of treatment with antipsychotics, emphasis should be placed on their antipruritic properties and the effect on degree of preoccupation with the infection rather than their antipsychotic properties. Follow-up is important, as patients mostly do not attribute their recovery to antipsychotics and the risk of recurrence is high after cessation of antipsychotic medication."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of the influence of metabolic processes and body composition on cognitive functions: Nutrition and Dementia Project (NutrDem Project).", "Abstract": "The global increase in the prevalence of dementia and its associated comorbidities and consequences has stimulated intensive research focused on better understanding of the basic mechanisms and the possibilities to prevent and/or treat cognitive decline or dementia. The etiology of cognitive decline and dementia is very complex and is based upon the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. A growing body of epidemiological evidence has suggested that metabolic syndrome and its components may be important in the development of cognitive decline. Furthermore, an abnormal body mass index in middle age has been considered as a predictor for the development of dementia.

We approached all doctors who had trained in post-graduate psychiatry in Zimbabwe in 2010 and conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with all except one (n = 6). We analysed the data using constant comparison and thematic analysis. Trainees described the apprenticeship model as the programme's primary strength, through providing clinical exposure and role models. Programme weaknesses included shortages in information sources, trainee salaries, trainers, public health education, and in the mental health service. Most respondents were, however, eager to continue practising psychiatry in Zimbabwe, motivated by family ties, national commitment and helping vulnerable, stigmatized individuals. Respondents called for sub-speciality training and for infrastructure and training to do research. Resources need to be made available for psychiatric trainees in more SSA settings to develop public health competencies.

In this process of deliberation there should be a role for clinical phenomena such as improvement of symptoms, worsening of symptoms, objectification and reification, and psychiatrists should have the opportunity to consider whether these aspects really belong to the field of psychiatry.\nIn psychiatry the relationship between diagnosis and symptom classification is not clear-cut. However, since deliberation plays a major role in psychiatric diagnosis, it is important that psychiatrists continue to keep diagnosis separate from symptom classification. Unlike other medical specialists, psychiatrists sometimes classify an illness before making a diagnosis. Existing guidelines and an all-embracing guideline regarding diagnosis need to be harmonised. Confusion and misdiagnosis could be reduced if classifications from two classification systems were to be included in medico-psychiatric diagnosis."}, {"Title": "[Deaths in a Tunisian psychiatric hospital: an eleven-year retrospective study].", "Abstract": "Mortality in patients in psychiatric hospitals is reported to be two to three times as high as in the general population. In Tunisia, we do not have any figures on mortality and causes of death in psychiatric inpatients.\nThe aim of our study was to assess the mortality rate in a psychiatric hospital in comparison to the mortality rate in the general population, to determine the patients' profile, and to identify the causes and risk factors for these deaths.\nWe performed a retrospective, descriptive and comparative study. We examined the records of all patients who died during their stay in the different wards of psychiatry at the Razi Hospital in Tunis. We also scrutinized reports of autopsies in the Forensic Medicine unit at Charles-Nicolle Hospital in Tunis over a period of eleven years from January 1st, 2000 to December 31st, 2010. We conducted a descriptive study to calculate the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) aiming to highlight any existing excess mortality among the psychiatric inpatients compared to the general population. This ratio was obtained by dividing the observed number of deaths by the expected number of deaths. In the analytical study, our sample was compared to a control population made-up of randomly selected living patients among those admitted to the Razi hospital in 2010. This study allowed us to investigate the risk factors for premature mortality in psychiatric inpatients.\nThe average rate of mortality was two deaths per 1000 inpatients per year. Twenty-four percent (24%) of deaths involved institutionalized patients. Compared to the general population, premature mortality was noted among patients aged less than 40 (SMR=1.9). The older the patients were, the closer to 1 the SMR was. The average age at death was 51.38 years; 65% of patients were male, 60% had a low socio-economic level, 54% had a comorbid medical condition. Forty-two percent (42%) of deceased patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia with the paranoid form being the most prevalent (44%), 13% had bipolar disorder, 22% had psycho-organic disorders (mental retardation, dementia, delirium). Antipsychotics were the most prescribed psychotropic drugs. High doses were used. Forty percent of cases (40%) consisted of sudden deaths. A cause for death was identified in 80% of cases. In 92% of cases, the death was classified as being \"natural\". Main causes were respiratory (26%) and cardiovascular (9%). Accidental causes accounted for 8% of deaths. In 20% of cases, the cause remained undetermined. Three factors were identified as independent predictors of mortality among mental patients: age at death (OR=3.9 among patients older than 40), psychiatric diagnosis (OR=2.9 among patients with psychotic or mood disorders compared to other diagnoses) and combination of antipsychotic drugs (OR=6.09 in patients receiving more than two antipsychotics).\nYoung psychiatric inpatients seem to be at high risk of premature death: the SMR in our study was 1.9. It ranged between 2.15 and 6.55 in other similar studies. This increased risk mainly concerns non-natural deaths. The leading natural cause of death in our population was represented by thromboembolic accidents. Such a high thromboembolic risk may be explained by the mental illness itself, by physical restraint as well as by antipsychotic treatment. Diagnosing medical conditions in psychiatric patients is often a daunting task: history of the patient is sometimes unreliable and clinical features might be modified by psychotropic agents. Patient-related risk factors for premature death include poor socio-economic level, access-to-care difficulties, positive family and personal history of mental and/or medical disorders, smoking, substance abuse, unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity. Moreover, iatrogenic effects of psychotropic drugs (combination of antipsychotics was more common in deceased patients than in controls) and inadequate medical care in psychiatric hospitals (lack of ECG devices, in particular) partly account for such a high mortality.\nIdentifying risk factors for deaths in psychiatric hospitals highlights needed changes in psychiatric management strategies taking into account the patient's characteristics as well as the drugs' safety profile. Further studies with larger samples are needed to better highlight risk factors for premature death in psychiatric inpatients. Identifying such risk factors is necessary to develop efficient preventive strategies."}, {"Title": "Race/ethnicity and other social determinants of psychological well-being and functioning in mental health clinics.", "Abstract": "Significant racial and ethnic differences exist in the receipt of psychiatric care and help-seeking.

We sought to explore differences between patients and psychiatrists regarding the qualities of a good psychiatrist.\nQualitative analysis of interviews using a modified grounded theory approach with 21 voluntary psychiatric inpatients and 18 psychiatrists.\nOne hundred thirty-one separate qualities emerged from the data. The qualities of a good psychiatrist were viewed in the context of motivations, functions, methods, and results obtained, mirroring the themes established in the pilot studies. Patients and psychiatrists mostly concurred on the qualities of a good psychiatrist, with 62.6% of the qualities emerging from both groups. However significant differences existed. Patient-specific qualities included proof of altruistic motives, diligence, clinical competence, and positive results. What the psychiatrist represented to patients in relation to gender, culture, and clinical prestige also mattered to patients. Psychiatrist-specific qualities related to societal (e.g. public protection) and professional concerns (e.g. boundary issues).\nThe results of this study demonstrate that patients and psychiatrists have different views about the qualities of a good psychiatrist. Patients may expect proof of care, diligence, and competence from the psychiatrist, along with positive results.

Diabetic patients are more likely to experience depression, and diabetic patients with depression are more likely to undergo an amputation. Also, both diabetes and depression independently increase the healthcare costs in the United States. The objective of the present investigation was to increase knowledge among diabetic foot practitioners with respect to psychiatric and other mental health patient-care issues, specifically the potential application of the 5 stages of grief to diabetic limb loss and amputation. We enlisted the assistance of a clinical professor from the psychiatry department at our institution to review the 5 stages of grief, provide context specific for application to diabetic limb loss, and offer clinically relevant guidelines for surgeons to better understand and communicate with their patients at each stage. The 5 stages reviewed were denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. We hope that the present review will increase the body of knowledge with respect to relevant psychiatric issues and the diabetic foot and provide a starting point for increased awareness with respect to this important, yet underappreciated, aspect of patient care."}, {"Title": "[Epigenetics of schizophrenia: a review].", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a frequent and disabling disease associated with heterogeneous psychiatric phenotypes. It emerges during childhood, adolescence or young adulthood and has dramatic consequences for the affected individuals, causing considerable familial and social burden, as well as increasing health expenses. Although some progress has been made in the understanding of their physiopathology, many questions remain unsolved, and the disease is still poorly understood. The prevailing hypothesis regarding psychotic disorders proposes that a combination of genetic and/or environmental factors, during critical periods of brain development increases the risk for these illnesses. Epigenetic regulations, such as DNA methylation, can mediate gene x environment interactions at the level of the genome and may provide a potential substrate to explain the variability in symptom severity and family heritability. Initially, epigenetics was used to design mitotic and meiotic changes in gene transcription that could not be attributed to genetic mutations. It referred later to changes in the epigenome not transmitted through the germline. Thus, epigenetics refers to a wide range of molecular mechanisms including DNA methylation of cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides and post-translational histone modifications. These mechanisms alter the way the transcriptional factors bind the DNA, modulating its expression. Prenatal and postnatal environmental factors may affect these epigenetics factors, having responsability in long-term DNA transcription, and influencing the development of psychiatric disorders.\nThe object of this review is to present the state of knowledge in epigenetics of schizophrenia, outlining the most recent findings in the matter.\nWe did so using Pubmed, researching words such as 'epigenetics', 'epigenetic', 'schizophrenia', 'psychosis', 'psychiatric'. This review summarizes evidences mostly for two epigenetic mechanisms: DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications.\nFirst, in terms of epidemiology and transmission, the theoretical model of epigenetics applies to schizophrenia. Then, most environmental factors that have proved a link with this disease, may generate epigenetic mechanisms. Next, mutations have been found in regions implied in epigenetic mechanism among populations with schizophrenia. Some epigenetic alterations in DNA regions have been previously linked with neurodevelopmental abnormalities. In psychosis, some authors have found methylation differences in COMT gene, in reelin gene and in some genes implicated in dopaminergic, serotoninergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic pathways. Histone modifications have been described, in particular the H3L4 histone methylation. Finally, we tried to underline the difficulties in epigenetic research, notably in psychiatry, and the limits in this matter.\nThe epigenetic field may explain a lot of questions around the physiopathology of the complex psychiatric disease that is schizophrenia. It may be a substratum to the prevailing hypothesis of gene x environment interaction. The research in the matter is definitely expanding. It justifies easily the need to improve the effort in the domain to overpass some limits inherent to the matter."}, {"Title": "Delirium screening anchored in child development: The Cornell Assessment for Pediatric Delirium.", "Abstract": "The recently validated Cornell Assessment for Pediatric Delirium (CAPD) is a new rapid bedside nursing screen for delirium in hospitalized children of all ages. The present manuscript provides a \"developmental anchor points\" reference chart, which helps ground clinicians' assessment of CAPD symptom domains in a developmental understanding of the presentation of delirium.\nDuring the development of this CAPD screening tool, it became clear that clinicians need specific guidance and training to help them draw on their expertise in child development and pediatrics to improve the interpretative reliability of the tool and its accuracy in diagnosing delirium. The developmental anchor points chart was formulated and reviewed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts to evaluate content validity and include consideration of sick behaviors within a hospital setting.\nThe CAPD developmental anchor points for the key ages of newborn, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 28 weeks, 1 year, and 2 years served as the basis for training bedside nurses in scoring the CAPD for the validation trial and as a multifaceted bedside reference chart to be implemented within a clinical setting. In the current paper, we discuss the lessons learned during implementation, with particular emphasis on the importance of collaboration with the bedside nurse, the challenges of establishing a developmental baseline, and further questions about delirium diagnosis in children.\nThe CAPD with developmental anchor points provides a validated, structured, and developmentally informed approach to screening and assessment of delirium in children. With minimal training on the use of the tool, bedside nurses and other pediatric practitioners can reliably identify children at risk for delirium."}, {"Title": "General psychiatric residents and corrections: moving forensic education beyond the classroom.", "Abstract": "Mental illness in the criminal justice system is one of the most important and underserved public health challenges in psychiatry today, but few general psychiatry residency programs offer clinical education in correctional psychiatry.

Several business models for effective change management exist and can be utilized by psychiatric educators. The psychodynamic models of change are useful for understanding the psychological impact of change on organizations and individuals. Effective management of change requires careful attention to the goals of the organization, development of a detailed plan to implement change, adequate resources to carry out the change, effective leadership and communication, and contingency plans for unforeseen events.

However, student participation remains limited despite growing educational emphasis upon global health. Medical students continue to report negative attitudes to psychiatry in high-income countries, and in Somaliland, the lack of public sector psychiatrists limits medical students' awareness of mental healthcare. The authors describe the design, implementation, and mixed-methods analysis of a peer-to-peer psychiatry e-learning partnership between UK and Somaliland students arising from a global mental health link between the two countries.\nMedical students at King's College London and Hargeisa and Amoud universities, Somaliland, were grouped into 24 pairs. Participants aimed to complete ten fortnightly meetings to discuss psychiatry topics via the website MedicineAfrica. Students completed initial and final evaluations including Attitudes toward Psychiatry (ATP-30) questions, a stigma questionnaire, and brief evaluations after each meeting.\nQuantitative findings demonstrated that enjoyment, interest, and academic helpfulness were rated highly by students in Somaliland and moderately by students in the UK. Somaliland students' attitudes to psychiatry were significantly more positive post-participation, whereas UK students' attitudes remained stable. Qualitative findings identified more gains in factual knowledge for Somaliland students, whereas UK students reported more cross-cultural learning. Reasons for non-completion and student-suggested improvements emphasized the need to ensure commitment to the program by participants.\nThis partnership encouraged students to consider global mental health outside the standard medical education environment, through an e-learning format solely utilizing existing resources. This new approach demonstrates potential benefits to students in contrasting locations of brief, focused online peer-to-peer education partnerships, expanding the scope of health links to the medical professionals of the future."}, {"Title": "Non-verbal communication in meetings of psychiatrists and patients with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Recent evidence found that patients with schizophrenia display non-verbal behaviour designed to avoid social engagement during the opening moments of their meetings with psychiatrists.

The core of verbal fluency lies in the capacity to manage the executive aspects of language. The standard scores of the semantic verbal fluency test are broadly used in the neuropsychological assessment of the elderly, and different analytical methods are likely to extract even more information from the data generated in this test. Graph theory, a mathematical approach to analyze relations between items, represents a promising tool to understand a variety of neuropsychological states. This study reports a graph analysis of data generated by the semantic verbal fluency test by cognitively healthy elderly (NC), patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment-subtypes amnestic (aMCI) and amnestic multiple domain (a+mdMCI)-and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sequences of words were represented as a speech graph in which every word corresponded to a node and temporal links between words were represented by directed edges. To characterize the structure of the data we calculated 13 speech graph attributes (SGA). The individuals were compared when divided in three (NC-MCI-AD) and four (NC-aMCI-a+mdMCI-AD) groups. When the three groups were compared, significant differences were found in the standard measure of correct words produced, and three SGA: diameter, average shortest path, and network density. SGA sorted the elderly groups with good specificity and sensitivity. When the four groups were compared, the groups differed significantly in network density, except between the two MCI subtypes and NC and aMCI. The diameter of the network and the average shortest path were significantly different between the NC and AD, and between aMCI and AD. SGA sorted the elderly in their groups with good specificity and sensitivity, performing better than the standard score of the task. These findings provide support for a new methodological frame to assess the strength of semantic memory through the verbal fluency task, with potential to amplify the predictive power of this test. Graph analysis is likely to become clinically relevant in neurology and psychiatry, and may be particularly useful for the differential diagnosis of the elderly."}, {"Title": "A review of OROS methylphenidate (Concerta(\u00ae)) in the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurobehavioural disorder with onset during childhood. It affects a child's development, both at home and at school, and impacts on social, emotional and cognitive functioning, in both the home and the school environment. Untreated ADHD is very often associated with poor academic achievement, low occupational status, increased risk of substance abuse and delinquency. Current practice guidelines recommend a multimodal approach in the treatment of ADHD, which includes educational, behavioural and mental health interventions, and pharmacological management. Stimulant medications, including methylphenidate (MPH) and amphetamine products, are recommended as first-line pharmacotherapy in the treatment of ADHD. The choice of stimulant is influenced by several factors; the most influential factor is the duration of action. Long-acting medication provides benefits long after school and work. It also increases the likelihood of once-daily dosing, thereby eliminating the need for mid-day dosing, making the treatment more private, avoiding stigma and improving adherence to medication. MPH is the most widely used psychotropic medication in child psychiatry. It was first developed for use in children as an oral, immediate-release formulation and more recently as various extended-release formulations. These latter formulations include the 12 h preparation Concerta(\u00ae) (osmotic-release oral system [OROS] MPH), which utilizes an osmotic pump system, designed to overcome the difficulties of multiple daily dosing. Since it received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration in August 2000, OROS MPH has been quickly and widely accepted as one of the preferred treatments for ADHD because of its once-daily dosing. This paper reviews the data in support of long-acting OROS MPH in children, adolescents and adults, both in ADHD and in association with its comorbidities."}, {"Title": "Time use among individuals with persistent mental illness: identifying risk factors for imbalance in daily activities.

Participants (n=103) were selected from a psychiatric outpatient unit using a randomized stratified selection procedure. The main findings indicated that time spent in daily activities increased with age, and that older individuals more often had a beneficial daily rhythm. Women and individuals living with children spent more time on self-care/self-maintenance than men and individuals living without children. Individuals with a diagnosis of psychosis spent less total time in daily activities than individuals with non-psychosis. In conclusion, general psychiatric symptoms, such as self-blame, anxiety, and difficulties in cooperating with others, explained most of the risk of spending little time in work/education as well as the risk of spending long periods asleep and having an adverse daily rhythm. A diagnosis of psychosis and high levels of general symptoms together explained most of the risk of having low total time use in activity. Factors such as age and living with children or not seemed to be important factors in relation to time use and daily rhythm."}, {"Title": "Bridging the gap: Lessons we have learnt from the merging of psychology and psychiatry for the optimisation of treatments for emotional disorders.", "Abstract": "In recent years the gap between psychological and psychiatric research and practice has lessened. In turn, greater attention has been paid toward how psychological and pharmacological treatments interact. Unfortunately, the majority of research has indicated no additive effect of anxiolytics and antidepressants when combined with psychological treatments, and in many cases pharmacological treatments attenuate the effectiveness of psychological treatments. However, as psychology and psychiatry have come closer together, research has started to investigate the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying psychological treatments. Such research has utilised preclinical models of psychological treatments, such as fear extinction, in both rodents and humans to determine multiple neural and molecular changes that may be responsible for the long-term cognitive and behavioural changes that psychological treatments induce. Currently, researchers are attempting to identify pharmacological agents that directly augment these neural/molecular changes, and which may be more effective adjuncts to psychological treatments than traditional anxiolytics and antidepressants. In this review we describe the research that has led to this new wave of thinking about combined psychological/pharmacological treatments. We also argue that an increased emphasis on identifying individual difference factors that predict the effectiveness of pharmacological adjuncts is critical in facilitating the translation of this preclinical research into clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Identification and management of adverse effects of antipsychotics in a tertiary care teaching hospital.", "Abstract": "Antipsychotics have revolutionized psychiatry by allowing significant numbers of patients in long-term hospital settings to be discharged and successfully maintained in the community.

In this study, 7 d after predator-scent-stress (PSS) exposure, male and female rats were classified into vulnerable (i.e., \"PTSD-like\") and resilient (i.e., minimally affected) phenotypes on the basis of their performance on a variety of behavioral measures. Genome-wide expression profiling in blood and two limbic brain regions (amygdala and hippocampus), followed by quantitative PCR validation, was performed in these two groups of animals, as well as in an unexposed control group. Differentially expressed genes were identified in blood and brain associated with PSS-exposure and with distinct behavioral profiles postexposure. There was a small but significant between-tissue overlap (4-21%) for the genes associated with exposure-related individual differences, indicating convergent gene expression in both sexes. To uncover convergent signaling pathways across tissue and sex, upstream activated/deactivated transcription factors were first predicted for each tissue and then the respective pathways were identified. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling was the only convergent pathway associated with individual differences when using the most stringent statistical threshold. Corticosterone treatment 1 h after PSS-exposure prevented anxiety and hyperarousal 7 d later in both sexes, confirming the GR involvement in the PSS behavioral response. In conclusion, genes and pathways associated with extreme differences in the traumatic stress behavioral response can be distinguished from those associated with trauma exposure. Blood-based biomarkers can predict aspects of brain signaling. GR signaling is a convergent signaling pathway, associated with trauma-related individual differences in both sexes."}, {"Title": "J.H. Pons on 'Sympathetic insanity': With an introduction by GE Berrios.", "Abstract": "The ancient concept of 'sympathy' originally referred to a putative affinity or force that linked all natural objects together. This notion was later used to explain the manner in which human beings related and felt for each other. A large literature exists on both the physical and psychological definitions of sympathy. Until the nineteenth century the conceptual apparatus of medicine preserved the view that the organs of the human body had a sympathetic affinity for each other. In addition to these 'physiological' (normal) sympathies there were morbid ones which explained the existence of various diseases. A morbid sympathy link also explained the fact that insanity followed the development of pathological changes in the liver, spleen, stomach and other bodily organs. These cases were classified as 'sympathetic insanities'. After the 1880s, the sympathy narrative was gradually replaced by physiological, endocrinological and psychodynamic explanations. The clinical states involved, however, are often observed in hospital practice and constitute the metier of 'consultation-liaison psychiatry'.

This consumption has a major professional, social and health impact on the individuals and their families. The cost of such, estimated in Europe to be of 155.8 billion Euros in 2010, is the highest among the central nervous system diseases in Europe, far higher than that of depression or dementia. Patients suffering from psychiatric disorders are more frequently affected by problems related to alcohol use than the general population. They are also more vulnerable to the immediate and subsequent consequences of their consumption. The alcohol related disorders that are often accompanied by risk taking and other addictive behaviour require a global assessment of the addiction, with and without substance, and of the complications. These have a strong impact on risk taking, compliance with care, and the morbidity of somatic and psychiatric disorders, as well as access to optimal care and the life span of patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. The development of addictology care, with integrative treatment programs, is recommended in response to these public health issues. Nevertheless, specific addictology practices and partners with addictology care structures are still scarcely developed in psychiatry. Firstly, it would be necessary to set up such integrated treatments through the systematisation of an \"addictology\" checkup on admission, a global assessment of addictive behaviour and cognitive disorders, using pragmatic tools that are user-friendly for the care teams, maintain the reduction in risk taking, and apply prescriptions for addiction to psychotropic treatments, in liaison with the referring general practitioner. As early as possible, accompanied by specific training in addictology for the psychiatrists and the mental health nursing teams, such care could be enhanced by the development of liaison and advanced psychiatric consultation teams, specialised in addictology, together with the installation of a addictology care network in supplementary psychiatry of levels 1, 2 and 3 in addictology. This network of specific care would notably permit the integrated management of patients suffering from acute psychiatric disorders or requiring care under constraint. More specific care networks for particular problems (maternity issues, adolescence, HIV and hepatitis, cognitive disorders\u2026) and programs of therapeutic education could reinforce this proposal within a protocol of care that should be legible, coherent and coordinated.

Included patients received baseline measurements followed by six-month intervention. Individual utilisation of treatment modules and number of readmissions, differentiated according to legal bases were assessed.Inclusion rate: 17.4\u200a% of all screened subjects (115) and 57\u200a% of all potentially includable subjects, dropout rate: 15\u200a%. Mean utilisation rate: 23.5 therapeutic contacts per 6 months. Readmission rate: 50\u200a%, of these 60\u200a% on voluntary legal basis.Study inclusion, mean utilisation and dropout rates attest the feasibility and acceptance of the intervention in the population under study. A preponderance of voluntary vs. compulsory readmissions to hospital during the intervention indicates that in the majority of patients a higher degree of therapeutic cooperativeness can be reached. Further study on reduction of compulsory readmissions and on avoidance of a forensic course by application of the here introduced intervention in combination with methods of risk assessment in a consecutive main project seems justified."}, {"Title": "The German version of the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS): Development and evaluation of its psychometric properties.", "Abstract": "Lack of insight and delusional thinking are hallmarks of a series of psychological disorders such as psychotic disorders and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the German version of the clinician-administered Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS; Am J Psychiatry 1998;155:e102-e108), which consists of 7 items assessing the degree of delusionality in the individual's disorder-related belief (e.g., \"The person behind me is staring at me\", \"My nose looks disgusting\"). Specifically, the original BABS was translated and back-translated according to established translation guidelines and administered in 70 individuals diagnosed with BDD. Internal consistency as well as convergent and divergent validity was high, suggesting that the German version of the BABS is a reliable and valid instrument to assess delusional thinking in psychological disorders such as BDD."}, {"Title": "Striatal development in autism: repetitive behaviors and the reward circuitry.", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined by two essential features \u2013 impaired social communication abilities, including deficits with social reciprocity, nonverbal communication and establishing relationships, and by the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests (RRBIs). Social deficits get the majority of attention both in science and in the popular media, but RRBIs are equally important in understanding autism. Although RRBIs are also seen in typically developing preschoolers, as well as in other psychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, their impairing and persisting character is a hallmark of ASD. Repetitive behaviors are among the first signs of ASD, with significant elevations by the child's first birthday. Individuals with ASD of all ages and cognitive ability levels display RRBIs to variable degrees, with males usually being more severely affected than females. Caregivers of individuals with ASD commonly emphasize that RRBIs are among the most challenging facets of the disorder on an everyday basis. They negatively impact social, cognitive, family functioning and well-being, often leading to increased levels of parental stress and negative parenting styles. While the clinical description and natural history of RRBIs is becoming clear, an understanding of the biological bases of this set of features has only recently begun to emerge. Better insight into the ontogenesis of RRBIs and their underlying neurobiology is needed not only to inform models of the etiology of ASD, but also to foster the development of new interventions. In this issue of Biological Psychiatry, Langen et al. examine differences in the rate of basal ganglia growth in ASD relative to typically developing children (TDC). Their volumetric analyses focused on developmental trajectories of the ventral striatum (with nucleus accumbens) and dorsal striatum (with caudate nucleus and putamen). These components of the basal ganglia are the major subcortical targets within the frontostriatal behavior control loops that are recognized as likely subserving RRBIs. This current study is a follow up of this same group's earlier work showing cross sectional differences in growth trajectory. While several labs have previously reported enlargement of the caudate nucleus in ASD, this current study is the first to make repeat morphology measurements, thus overcoming limitations associated with cross sectional analyses. This study involved 86 seven to seventeen year old cases and controls who had 2 MRI anatomical scans approximately 2 and a half years apart on average, allowing a direct test of differential striatal growth. The rate of basal ganglia growth was correlated with the severity of RRBIs as assessed by parent interview at the time of the first MRI scan, corroborating earlier work on the role of the striatum in repetitive behaviors among children with ASD. Specifically the caudate nucleus showed a growth rate in ASD that was twice as high as the growth rate in TDC (i.e., 4.6% vs. 2.3%). This was independent of overall brain growth, use of psychotropic medications, or other major confounds. Most importantly, more severe RRBIs early in life, particularly insistence on sameness behaviors, such as avoiding trivial changes in routines and environments as well as adhering to compulsions and rituals, were related to faster striatal growth between average ages of about 9 and 12 year old, with large effect sizes (e.g., caudate nucleus: Cohen's <i>d</i> = 0.86). While Langen et al. discuss several complementary explanations for their findings, they conclude that the divergent trajectory of caudate development in relation to RRBIs most likely results from early, and possibly continuing, patterns of repetitive behaviors that shape striatal development \u2013 not the other way around. This new set of data elegantly adds to the notion that the striatum plays a central role in core ASD phenomenology. However, one question lingers: what cause RRBIs, like insistence on sameness, compulsions and rituals, to become such a force so as to impact the growth trajectory of an evolutionarily ancient brain structure like the caudate nucleus? This question ties in with a long-standing debate among clinicians and scientists concerning the potential functions that the myriad of RRBIs might serve in individuals with ASD. While several plausible ideas have been advanced, convincing support for any specific one is lacking. One hypothesis that is gaining increased research attention, however, involves the effects of alterations of the balance between social and nonsocial motivation in <i>reward circuitry</i> on RRBIs. This model suggests that ASD is in part a disorder of \u201cbehavioral dependency\u201d to RRBIs because of the rewarding effects they induce. Indeed, insistence on sameness and preoccupying restricted interests are reported to be quite pleasurable by affected individuals. The dorsal striatum with caudate nucleus, in particular, is believed to mediate reward value for purposeful actions. Functional imaging studies show that the brain's reward circuitry in ASD, particularly striatum and ventral prefrontal cortices, selectively over-reacts to objects that may comprise an intense special interest, whereas it under-reacts to more typical desires such as social reward and money. This may indicate that the brain in ASD cares less for conventional rewards. It is not yet known if an initial lack of social reward motivation opens the door for enhanced rewarding effects of certain circumscribed objects, topics, and routines, or whether the reverse is true \u2013 that the dominating reward effects of nonsocial objects, topic and routines diminishes the reward value of social engagement. The rewarding effects of RRBIs are thought to be fueled by the preference of those with ASD for predictability in their environment, where they can exercise more control; social encounters are in many ways the antithesis of this, as these are often rapid, hard to control and offer much more variable reinforcement contingencies. When RRBIs are rewarding, their pursuit may be strengthened through reinforcement mechanisms that progressively turn them into rigid and strongly desired habits that are performed almost automatically with little conscious oversight. With this heuristic model, RRBIs are self-reinforcing, and they begin to hijack the normal developmental trajectory of entire repertoires of behaviors. The dorsal (associative) striatum with caudate nucleus dominates these processes. Thus, an accelerated growth rate of the caudate related to RRBIs, as reported by Langen et al., could reflect atypical brain specialization in individuals with ASD. From early in life the caudate nucleus mediates habitual processes for a wide range of different stimuli and contexts. Across development, however, the caudate may become co-opted by the most rewarding aspects of the environment. This interactive and self-sustaining biobehavioral process \u2013 in concert with other mesocorticolimbic functions \u2013 may shape the growth trajectory of the caudate nucleus and strengthens the occurrence of RRBIs in ASD (Figure 1). On a day-to-day basis, RRBIs interfere with social development and functioning as they may absorb resources typically dedicated to other learning opportunities, including social ones. The observation that RRBIs in ASD involve plasticity of the caudate nucleus \u2013 one major hub within the frontostriatal circuits that control behavior \u2013 is a fascinating advance for our field. It brings us closer to the neurobiological roots of how and why affected individuals develop and maintain this set of challenging behaviors. Follow-up research will need to address several issues to improve upon the approach of the Langen et al study. One critical issue is that researchers need to use more precise behavioral measurement tools. This could involve item rating scales with greater item density around key concepts, as it is clear to all the ADI-R is sorely lacking in this regard. Also, quantitative motion capture tools are now widely available; deploying these in natural environments seems to us to be extremely promising adjuncts to standard rating scales. Repeat behavioral measurement across time, in sync with repeat brain measurement is an important next step that will enable better characterization of the interplay between RRBIs and brain dynamics. In this regard, multimodal imaging in the same sample is called for, as structural imaging will surely only capture portions of the story. The findings by Langen et al. call attention to the importance of RRBIs in autism. Because RRBIs may be rooted in the powerful reward circuitries that motivate a great deal of behavior, strategically targeting the role of reward mechanisms promises to improve treatment practices for limiting the life interfering aspects of RRBIs among individuals with ASD and their families."}, {"Title": "Self-inflicted skin lesions: a review of the terminology.", "Abstract": "The current literature on the management of self-inflicted skin lesions points to an overall paucity of treatments with a high level of evidence (randomized controlled trials, controlled trials, or meta-analyses).

This condition manifests with significant behavioral changes (from mildly decreased speech output to complete mutism) that interfere with the ability to communicate. After structural brain disorders are excluded, one of the diagnoses that always should be considered is catatonia. However, the causes of catatonia are numerous, ranging from psychiatric causes to a plethora of medical illnesses. Therefore, it is not surprising that there are many proposed underlying mechanisms of catatonia and that controversy persists about the etiology of specific cases.There are only 6 reports of hyponatremia-induced catatonia and psychosis in the literature. Here, we present the case of a 30-year-old woman with catatonia and psychosis induced by hyponatremia, and we use this report to exemplify the multitude of biologic causes of catatonia and to propose a new way to look at the neuroanatomical basis of processing, particularly the vertical processing systems we believe are involved in catatonia."}, {"Title": "Assessing a financial incentive for reducing length of stay of psychiatric inpatients: implications for financing psychiatric services.", "Abstract": "Restricted government budgets are forcing countries to implement more efficient health measures. Unlike in somatic medicine, the process of evaluating payment systems in psychiatry in Switzerland is ongoing. A pilot approach in one psychiatric hospital, here called \"new remuneration system (NRS)\", was introduced to better control length of stay (LOS) by combining a lump sum with degressive daily rates. This is a first evaluation of the NRS in terms of a reduction of the LOS, and the prevention of early readmissions by analysing meaningful outcome categories.\nThe total sample consisted of N = 66,626 psychiatric inpatient episodes and a subsample of N = 60,847. Data were collected from the hospital using the NRS and three comparison hospitals in the Canton of Zurich. The observation period covered 2005 to 2011, the years before and after the implementation of the NRS in 2009. To examine the outcome categories, general logistic models were used.\nThe median LOS at all four hospitals was 21 days (IQR: 46-8). In the NRS-hospital, there was a significantly higher proportion of 6 to10day stays after 2009, indicating an influence of the lumpsum measure. At the same time, data revealed a somewhat lower proportion of readmissions within 30 days in the NRS-hospital. In general, effect sizes were small.\nWithin the observation period of three years since 2009, the NRS had a small influence on LOS and early readmissions. The stability of effects needs to be monitored. More sophisticated modellings of the NRS might lead to further insights."}, {"Title": "A report from the 167th American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting (May 3-7 - New York, U.S.A.).", "Abstract": "Sharing space with a fashion fair, the American Psychiatric Association's Annual Meeting took place at the Javits Center on the West side of Manhattan where psychiatrists and psychiatry-focused neuroscientists met to discuss the latest advances in antipsychotic, antidepressant and related therapies.

That in a sense also happened in psychiatry, with experts defending the current place of lithium in therapeutics. Newest, youngest look? That was also true for psychiatry, with new investigational therapeutics challenging the place of older treatment approaches because of improved efficacy, better safety and tolerability, or easier administration. What about these patchwork trends? This again was met in psychiatry, with combination therapies aimed at a more comprehensive control of underlying processes in diseases such as schizophrenia.

Magnetic resonance imaging scans were examined in subjects who were cognitively normal at baseline, some of whom subsequently developed clinical symptoms of AD. The images were mapped to a common template, using shape-based diffeomorphometry. The multidimensional shape markers indexed through the temporal lobe structures were modeled using a changepoint model with explicit parameters, specifying the number of years preceding clinical symptom onset. Our model assumes that the atrophy rate of a considered brain structure increases years before detectable symptoms. The results demonstrate that the atrophy changepoint in the ERC occurs first, indicating significant change 8-10\u00a0years prior to onset, followed by the hippocampus, 2-4\u00a0years prior to onset, followed by the amygdala, 3\u00a0years prior to onset. The ERC is significant bilaterally, in both our local and global measures, with estimates of ERC surface area loss of 2.4% (left side) and 1.6% (right side) annually. The same changepoint model for ERC volume gives 3.0% and 2.7% on the left and right sides, respectively.

Psychiatric investigations as to why a son might murder his mother yield indications of a high rate of mental illness, primarily psychotic disorders, in perpetrators. In an attempt to gain an in-depth understanding of the role of the mother-son bond in the etiology of matricide by mentally disordered sons, this article presents a qualitative study of nine cases of matricide examined at two Italian Forensic Psychiatry Departments between 2005 and 2010 and retrospective analysis of forensic psychiatry reports on the offenders. Most matricides suffered from psychotic disorders, especially schizophrenia. Nevertheless, not all the perpetrators had psychotic symptoms at the time of the crime. A \"pathologic\" mother-son bond was found in all cases. However, mental illness is not the only variable related to matricide and, taken alone, is not enough to explain the crime. Several factors in the history of the mother and son need to be probed, especially how their relationship developed over the years. The peculiar dynamics of the mother-son relationship and the unique personalities and life experiences of both subjects are the real key to cases of matricide."}, {"Title": "Prevalence, impact and cultural context of psychotic experiences among ethnic minority youth.", "Abstract": "The risk for psychotic disorders is increased for many ethnic minority groups and may develop in early childhood.

The Dutch (n = 702, 45.4%), Moroccan-Dutch (n = 400, 25.9%) and Turkish-Dutch (n = 170, 11.0%) ethnic groups could be studied separately. Self-report questionnaires on PE, impact and cultural context were administered.\nPrevalence of PE with high impact was 3.1% in Dutch, 9.5% in Moroccan-Dutch and 7.1% in Turkish-Dutch youth. Compared to Dutch youth, odds ratios were 3.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-5.1] for Moroccan-Dutch youth and 2.2 (95% CI 1.1-4.6) for Turkish-Dutch youth. Differences were not explained by cultural or religious differences.\nThe increased risk for psychotic disorders in ethnic minorities may already be detectable in childhood, since PE with high impact were more common among ethnic minority youth compared to majority youth. The additional measurement of impact of PE appears to be a valid approach to identify those children at risk to develop psychotic or other more common psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Smartphone ownership and interest in mobile applications to monitor symptoms of mental health conditions.", "Abstract": "Patient retrospective recollection is a mainstay of assessing symptoms in mental health and psychiatry.

However, the report did not sufficiently describe conditions surrounding actual applications of the law, and subsequently the legal affairs committee of the Japanese Society of Neurology and Psychiatry carried out a survey regarding several items not covered in the report. Survey targets were 28 hospitals treating inpatients under the Medical Treatment and Supervision Act (Part 1), and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Part 2). Part 1 comprised three items: 1) rulings to dismiss petitions for discharge; 2) rulings to dismiss petitions for continued hospitalization; and 3) rehospitalization under the Medical Treatment and Supervision Act. Survey results showed that, of 16 rulings against petitions for discharge, only two were considered reasonable by the hospitalizing institution. This offers an excellent opportunity to examine the remaining cases in detail and highlight problems related to the law, such as the issue of social hospitalization and questions regarding differences in diagnosis and risk assessment. Of 17 cases of rehospitalization under the Medical Treatment and Supervision Act, eight cases were deemed to involve some mistakes or deficiencies in treatment during the initial hospitalization. It is important to examine details of treatment during initial hospitalization, and treatment and support provided after initial discharge, in these cases, as well. The survey sent to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare consisted of 17 items, but responses were received for only three items: 1) checks and collections of reports; 2) the detailed contents of requests in 79 cases where improvements in treatment were requested; and 3) the details of 19 cases where patients were transferred to other medical facilities for hospitals covered by this law.

We would like to review for you some of the formative experiences in Michael's life that wedded psychoanalysis and general practice, and how they contributed to his major educational commitment over 40 years to furthering the understanding and integration of psychosocial factors in the practice of primary healthcare as experienced by doctors all over the world. We would also like to highlight some of his major insights and see to what extent they are incorporated in contemporary medical education and practice. We believe that some of his major insights have been neglected and others have been further amplified and extended. Our intention is to speak not only to medical students who desire to pursue medicine related directly to patient care but as well to seasoned practitioners who continue on a daily basis to care for individual patients and their families."}, {"Title": "Prosocial skills may be necessary for better peer functioning in children with symptoms of disruptive behavior disorders.", "Abstract": "Children with disruptive behavior disorders experience substantial social challenges; however, the factors that account for (i.e., mediate), or influence (i.e., moderate), peer problems are not well understood. This study tested whether symptoms of Oppositional Defiant Disorder and Conduct Disorder were associated with peer impairment and whether prosocial skills mediated or moderated these associations. Teacher ratings were gathered for 149 children (Mage = 9.09, SD = 1.71, 26% female) referred for behavioral concerns to an urban child psychiatry clinic. Path-analytic linear regressions testing mediation and moderation effects showed that prosocial skills significantly moderated the negative effects of symptoms of Conduct Disorder on peer impairment. Children showed less peer impairment only when they had relatively few conduct symptoms and high prosocial skills. Measurement of prosocial skills, in addition to conduct problems, may best capture factors which contribute to peer problems of children with disruptive behaviors."}, {"Title": "Defense mechanisms and implicit emotion regulation: a comparison of a psychodynamic construct with one from contemporary neuroscience.", "Abstract": "A growing interest in the neuroscience of emotion regulation, particularly the subfield of implicit emotion regulation, brings new opportunity for the psychodynamic treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood. At the same time, psychodynamic theorists have become more aware of the centrality of affects in mental life. This paper introduces a manualized psychodynamic approach called Regulation-Focused Dynamic Psychotherapy (RFP-C). Theoretically based on the domain construct of implicit emotion regulation (ER), this approach posits that contemporary affect-oriented conceptualizations of defense mechanisms are theoretically similar to the neuroscience construct of implicit emotion regulation. To illustrate this theoretical similarity, the literature connected with both concepts is reviewed. The implications of this idea, which could promote an interface between psychodynamics and contemporary academic psychiatry and psychology, are discussed."}, {"Title": "Vicarious traumatization and coping in medical students: a pilot study.", "Abstract": "This study explored the impact of traumatic experiences on medical students during their clerkships.\nMedical students completed an anonymous online survey inquiring about traumatic experiences on required clerkships during their third year of medical school, including any symptoms they may have experienced as well as coping strategies they may have used.\nTwenty-six percent of students reported experiencing vicarious traumatization (VT) during their third year of medical school.\nThe experience of VT in medical students is relevant to medical educators, given that the resulting symptoms may impact student performance and learning as well as ongoing well-being. Fifty percent of the students who experienced VT in this study did so on the psychiatry clerkship. It is important for psychiatrists to recognize that this is a potential risk for students in order to increase the likelihood that appropriate supports are provided."}, {"Title": "Health as moral failing: medication restriction among women with eating disorders.", "Abstract": "Individuals with eating disorders often exhibit profound ambivalence towards taking prescribed medications. They may actively restrict their intake of medications, take them and then purge them, or hoard them and 'binge' on them. Such behaviors are often labeled clinically as 'treatment resistance,' and power struggles over medication adherence between clinicians and clients often ensue. This paper advances an alternative perspective. Based on extensive ethnographic and clinical engagements with women with eating disorders who restrict their medication intake, the analytical focus is pivoted to consider medication refusal not only as communicative in the interpersonal realm, but also as a powerful means of self-communication within the context of a larger ethical and moral project. This larger project makes visible the underside of what Lakoff (2008) calls the logic of pharmaceutical reason, which presumes that people naturally strive for optimal health. For these clients, by contrast, the optimal state is not health, but deprivation, which is experienced as a moral imperative extending well beyond issues related to body weight and shape. Within a broader cultural context where medication use is increasingly viewed as a legitimate and even superior means of self-management, medication restriction among people with eating disorders signals layers of meaning far beyond 'treatment resistance.' Refusing needed or useful medication can become a private and personally meaningful practice, largely independent of the material or interpersonal effects of the drugs. This suggests that the symbolic significance of medications must in some cases be discerned by their selective absence."}, {"Title": "Is there a resumption of political psychiatry in the former Soviet Union?", "Abstract": "After the outbreak of the Ukrainian crisis in the spring of 2014, the former Soviet Union again became front-page news. The sequence of events led to an atmosphere reminiscent of the Cold War. In Russia itself it led to a hunt for 'national traitors' and 'foreign agents' and observers both inside the country and abroad fear a return to Soviet-style repression. For the outside world this may come as a surprise, but human rights activists have been ringing the alarm bells for a few years. Ever since Vladimir Putin took power, the human rights situation has deteriorated. One of the warning signs was the return of the use of psychiatry for political purposes, to 'prevent' social or political activism or to ostracise an activist."}, {"Title": "Perceived barriers and facilitators for an academic career in geriatrics: medical students' perspectives.", "Abstract": "There is a growing concern about a shortage of physician scientists. This problem is particularly severe in certain subspecialties such as geriatrics in general and geriatric psychiatry in particular. This study sought to obtain medical students' perspectives on barriers and facilitators toward pursuing a career in academics and/or in geriatric psychiatry or geriatic medicine.\nThe study surveyed 27 first-year medical students from six US medical schools, who had demonstrated a clear interest in academic geriatrics by completing a mentored summer research training program in geriatric medicine or geriatric psychiatry, funded by the National Institute on Aging. The survey included open-ended and close-ended questions about likely career choice and factors affecting it.\nSixty percent of students reported they were likely to pursue an academic career, 44 % a career in geriatric psychiatry or geriatic medicine, and only 36 % a career in academic geriatrics. The most frequently perceived barriers were a lack of knowledge about academic careers and lack of exposure to geriatrics, financial concerns due to loan debts and low compensation, and negative impressions of research and of working with older adults. Facilitators included positive experiences with or positive impressions of research and research mentors and of older adults, and the growing demand for geriatric care.\nAttracting capable and motivated medical students to academic careers in fields such as geriatric psychiatry or geriatic medicine should be a priority in seeking to expand the number of physician scientists and to add to the health-care workforce in underserved subspecialty areas. Necessary approaches should include opportunities to work in academic settings; availability of sustained and dedicated mentorship; early, consistent, and positive exposure to older adults; and financial incentives."}, {"Title": "Functional neurological symptom disorders in a pediatric emergency room: diagnostic accuracy, features, and outcome.", "Abstract": "In children, functional neurological symptom disorders are frequently the basis for presentation for emergency care. Pediatric epidemiological and outcome data remain scarce.\nAssess diagnostic accuracy of trainee's first impression in our pediatric emergency room; describe manner of presentation, demographic data, socioeconomic impact, and clinical outcomes, including parental satisfaction.\n(1) More than 1 year, psychiatry consultations for neurology patients with a functional neurological symptom disorder were retrospectively reviewed. (2) For 3 months, all children whose emergency room presentation suggested the diagnosis were prospectively collected. (3) Three to six months after prospective collection, families completed a structured telephone interview on outcome measures.\nTwenty-seven patients were retrospectively assessed; 31 patients were prospectively collected. Trainees' accurately predicted the diagnosis in 93% (retrospective) and 94% (prospective) cohorts. Mixed presentations were most common (usually sensory-motor changes, e.g. weakness and/or paresthesias). Associated stressors were mundane and ubiquitous, rarely severe. Families were substantially affected, reporting mean symptom duration 7.4 (standard error of the mean \u00b1 1.33) weeks, missing 22.4 (standard error of the mean \u00b1 5.47) days of school, and 8.3 (standard error of the mean \u00b1 2.88) of parental workdays (prospective cohort). At follow-up, 78% were symptom free. Parental dissatisfaction was rare, attributed to poor rapport and/or insufficient information conveyed.\nTrainees' clinical impression was accurate in predicting a later diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder. Extraordinary life stressors are not required to trigger the disorder in children. Although prognosis is favorable, families incur substantial economic burden and negative educational impact. Improving recognition and appropriately communicating the diagnosis may speed access to treatment and potentially reduce the disability and cost of this disorder."}, {"Title": "Anti-social personality characteristics and psychotic symptoms: Two pathways associated with offending in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Several research groups have shown that people with schizophrenia who offend do not form a homogenous group. A three-group model claimed by Hodgins proposes distinguishing between people who start offending before the onset of psychosis (early starters), after psychosis onset but at age 34\u2009years or under (late starters) and after psychosis onset but at age 35\u2009years or older (late first offenders).\nThis study aimed to test the hypotheses (1) that the personality of early starters and non-psychotic offenders would be similar, but different from either late-starter group; (2) that the late-starter groups would be more likely to have positive psychotic symptoms than non-criminal patients with schizophrenia; and (3) that symptom types would differentiate the psychotic groups.\nA retrospective file study was conducted on cases of 97 early starters, 100 late starters and 26 late first offenders all drawn from the Netherlands Institute of Forensic Psychiatry and Psychology (NIFP) archives 1993-2008, 115 non-psychotic offenders from 2005-2008 NIFP archives and 129 patients with schizophrenia and no criminal history from one general service in Rotterdam.\nEarly starters closely resembled the non-psychotic offenders in their premorbid anti-social personality characteristics. The two late-onset offending psychosis groups were more likely to have persecutory and/or grandiose delusions than non-offenders with psychosis, but so were the early starters.\nIn a first study to compare subgroups of offenders with psychosis directly with non-psychotic offenders and non-offenders with psychosis, we found such additional support for a distinction between early and late starters with psychosis that different treatment strategies would seem indicated, focusing on personality and substance misuse for the former but psychotic symptoms for all. It remains to be seen whether the higher rate of alcohol misuse amongst late first offenders is a fundamental distinction or a function of age difference."}, {"Title": "Discontinuation of somatic medication during psychiatric hospitalization.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric hospitalization can increase the risk of discontinuation of pharmacotherapy, which may negatively influence patients' health.\nTo investigate the association between psychiatric hospitalization and discontinuation of somatic medication.\nA retrospective crossover study was performed in patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital (index date), who had got somatic medication dispensed during the 3 months prior to hospitalization. Discontinuation of somatic medication was investigated at the following time points: index date and 3, 6, and 9 months before the index date. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of discontinuing somatic medication at the index date versus the time points before the index date were estimated using Cox regression.\nIn all, 471 hospitalized patients were included in the study; 38.9% of the patients were discontinuers on the index date. RR for discontinuation of \u22651 somatic medication was 1.88 (95% CI=1.55-2.27) at the index date compared with the other time points and highest for patients<45 years (RR=2.83; 95% CI=1.92-4.18).\nPsychiatric hospitalization was associated with an almost doubled risk of discontinuation of somatic medication.

The goal of this pilot study is to inform the implementation of Clinical Ethics Support Services in psychiatric institutions by assessing which topics of psychiatric practice are considered ethically challenging by the staff.\nExplorative survey as pilot study by questionnaire with clinical staff, quantitative (descriptive) and qualitative (coding) data-analysis.\nInvoluntary treatment, the relationship between healthcare professionals and patients, staff shortage and the collaboration between the professions as well as dealing with patient relatives came up as ethical challenges.\nClinical Ethics Support in psychiatric patient care should not only cover aspects that are specific for psychiatry, but also structural topics such as short resources, interprofessional collaboration and communication with relatives."}, {"Title": "The effect of stress management training on stress and depression in women with depression disorders: Using cognitive-behavioral techniques.", "Abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the effect of stress management training through cognitive-behavioral techniques on stress, social adaptability and depression in women with depression disorders.\nIn this study, 40 patients diagnosed with depression who had referred to psychiatry and consultation clinics of Isfahan were randomly selected and assigned to intervention and control groups (20 patients in each group). The intervention group received eight 90-min sessions of stress training through cognitive-behavioral techniques. Data collection tools included Cooper's stress questionnaire, Bell's social adaptability questionnaire and Hamilton's depression scale questionnaire. The participants completed the questionnaires before the intervention and 1 month after the same. Data analysis was performed using covariance analysis.\nBased on the results, considering variables of stress, social adaptability and depression, the equal variance hypothesis was confirmed. The relationship between pre- and post-test scores on stress, social adaptability and depression was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The modified mean difference was F = 12.45, P < 0.001 on stress; F = 6.88, P < 0.01 on social adaptability; and F = 5.36, P < 0.02 on depression, all of which were significant.\nStress management training through cognitive behavioral techniques can play a main role in depression reduction and development of social adaptability through modifying inappropriate social information-processing patterns."}, {"Title": "Cannabis Use and Dependence among French Schizophrenic Inpatients.", "Abstract": "To assess the prevalence of cannabis use and dependence in a population of schizophrenic inpatients and to compare schizophrenics with and without cannabis consumption.\nOne hundred one schizophrenic patients were examined during their first week of hospitalization. They answered the PANNS scale of schizophrenia, the CAGE and the Fagerstr\u00f6m questionnaire, and the DSM-IV-TR criteria for cannabis, alcohol, opiates, and nicotine use dependence were checked. We also assessed socio-demographic characteristics, the motive of cannabis consumption, and the number of cannabis joints and alcoholic drinks taken.\nThe prevalence of cannabis consumption was 33.6% among schizophrenic inpatients. Schizophrenics consuming cannabis were younger than non-schizophrenics (33.3 vs. 44.7\u2009years p\u2009<\u20090.0001), more often male (77 vs. 54%, p\u2009=\u20090.02) and had been hospitalized for the first time in psychiatry earlier (24.3 vs. 31.3 p\u2009=\u20090.003). Eighty-eight percent of cannabis consumers were dependent on cannabis. They were more often dependent on opiates (17 vs. 0%) and alcohol (32 vs. 7.4%, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and presented compulsive buying more often (48 vs. 27%, p\u2009=\u20090.04). Logistic regression revealed that factors associated to cannabis consumption among schizophrenics were cannabis dependence, male gender, pathological gambling, opiate dependence, number of joints smoked each day, and compulsive buying.\n33.6% of the schizophrenic patients hospitalized in psychiatry consume cannabis and most of them are dependent on cannabis and alcohol. Hospitalization in psychiatry may provide an opportunity to systematically identify a dependence disorder and to offer appropriate information and treatment."}, {"Title": "Characterization of fatigue states in medicine and psychiatry by structured interview.", "Abstract": "Unexplained fatigue states are prevalent, with uncertain diagnostic boundaries.\nPatients with fatigue-related illnesses were investigated by questionnaire and a novel semistructured interview to identify discriminatory features.\nCross-sectional samples of women from specialist practices with chronic fatigue syndrome (n = 20), postcancer fatigue (PCF; n = 20), or major depression (n = 16) were recruited. Additionally, two longitudinal samples were studied: women with fatigue associated with acute infection who subsequently developed postinfective fatigue syndrome (n = 20) or recovered uneventfully (n = 21), and women undergoing adjuvant therapy for breast cancer experiencing treatment-related fatigue who subsequently developed PCF (n = 16) or recovered uneventfully (n = 16). Patients completed self-report questionnaires, and trained interviewers applied the Semi-structured Clinical Interview for Neurasthenia. The receiver operating characteristics curves of the interview were measured against clinician-designated diagnoses. Cluster analyses were performed to empirically partition participants by symptom characteristics.\nThe interview had good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha \"fatigue\" = .83), and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for chronic fatigue syndrome (100% and 83%) and major depression (100% and 72%), with reasonable parameters for PCF (72% and 58%). Empirical clustering by \"fatigue\" or \"neurocognitive difficulties\" items allocated most patients to one group, whereas \"mood disturbance\" items correctly classified patients with depression only.\nThe Semi-structured Clinical Interview for Neurasthenia offers reliable diagnostic use in assessing fatigue-related conditions. The symptom domains of fatigue and neurocognitive difficulties are shared across medical and psychiatric boundaries, whereas symptoms of depression such as anhedonia are distinguishing."}, {"Title": "[Apathy in the structure of mental and neurological disorders of the old age].", "Abstract": "The studies on apathy, a common phenomenon in psychiatry, are summarized.

Positive and negative aspects of rural training were reported. In general, trainees reported positive experiences regarding supervision, consultant input and their Site Coordinator of training. Their experience of other aspects of training and education in rural areas was often negative with 52% of trainees feeling at a disadvantage due to fewer registrar peers and 60% feeling educationally isolated. Difficulty progressing through training, workforce shortages, difficulty accessing formal aspects of training and limited options for advanced training were reported. Metropolitan trainees on rotation to rural terms receive accommodation, travel and an increase in wage from the rural Local Health District. Rural trainees on rotation to the city for their mandatory subspecialty training receive no such support.\nThere are many challenges for rural trainees.

Recently, the U.S. NIMH has elaborated this vision through a new framework for mental health research, the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). This framework aims to orient mental health research toward the discovery of underlying neurobiological and biobehavioral mechanisms of mental disorders that will eventually lead to definitive treatments. In this article we consider the rationale of the RDoC and what it reveals about implicit models of mental disorders. As an overall framework for understanding mental disorders, RDoC is impoverished and conceptually flawed. These limitations are not accidental but stem from disciplinary commitments and interests that are at odds with the larger concerns of psychiatry. A multilevel, ecosocial approach to biobehavioral systems is needed both to guide relevant neuroscience research and insure the inclusion of social processes that may be fundamental contributors to psychopathology and recovery."}, {"Title": "Group trauma-informed treatment for adolescent psychiatric inpatients: a preliminary uncontrolled trial.", "Abstract": "Despite high rates of trauma exposure (46%-96%) and significant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 21%-29%) symptoms in adolescent psychiatric inpatients, there is a dearth of research on effective interventions delivered in inpatient settings. The current report describes the development of Brief STAIR-A, a repeatable 3-module version of skills training in affective and interpersonal regulation (STAIR) developed for adolescents in inpatient care. An uncontrolled design was used to conduct a preliminary examination of the group intervention's effectiveness. Adolescent psychiatric inpatients (N = 38; ages 12 years-17 years) admitted to a public hospital participated in Brief STAIR-A and attended a median of 6 sessions (range 3-36). They completed measures of PTSD and depressive symptom severity, coping skill use, and coping efficacy upon admission and again prior to discharge. Participants reported significant reductions in symptom severity (d = 0.65-0.67), no change in the absolute level of coping skills used (d = 0.16), but greater coping efficacy when discharged from care (d = 0.75). Results from this pilot study suggest that this brief group treatment shows promise for treating adolescents' trauma-related difficulties in inpatient psychiatry settings, but additional research examining its effectiveness is essential."}, {"Title": "Adolescents and the internet: what mental health clinicians need to know.", "Abstract": "The Internet's permeation into daily life has profoundly changed the practice of psychiatry with adolescents, who mobilize online social media and related technologies in their efforts to develop identity and \"hang out\" with peers.

Risk factors have been inconsistently described and the variance of this adverse effect remains poorly understood. This study aimed to establish independent risk factors for polyuria in a community, secondary-level lithium-treated sample of patients.\nThis was a cross-sectional study of the lithium-treated patients attending a general adult and an old age psychiatry service. Participants completed a 24-hour urine collection. Urine volume and the presence of polyuria were the outcomes of interest. The relationship between outcome and the participant's demographic and clinical characteristics was explored with univariable and multivariable analysis.\nA total of 122 participants were included in the analysis, with 38% being diagnosed with polyuria. Female gender and increased body weight independently predicted the presence of polyuria (standardized regression coefficient 1.01 and 0.94, respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.003, respectively).

Questions addressed awareness of changes in accessibility of psychiatric documentation, which parts of the psychiatric note were most useful, and ways in which reviewing psychiatric notes changed providers' practice and perception of patients with mental illness.\nSurvey return rate was 100 % due to in-person distribution and collection of survey. More than half (58 %) of respondents were unaware that they had access to psychiatric notes. Within the psychiatric note, providers focused most on plan, diagnosis, and assessment components. Those who were aware reported improved understanding (97 %) and comfort with discussing mental illness (79 %), increased consideration of side effects of psychiatric medications (79 %), and improved efficiency in encounters with psychiatric patients (97 %). Responses about likelihood to contact psychiatrists directly varied considerably. About 45 % of respondents were more likely to consider psychosomatic etiology for patients who were also seen by outpatient psychiatry.\nOverall, PCPs reported that accessibility of outpatient psychiatric notes significantly enhanced their experience of caring for patients with mental illness.

Based on the finding that patients who ask for medical assistance in suicide often have in mind the loss of their mental capacity, we submit PAS to an ethical analysis and put it into a broader context of patient autonomy at the end of life. In doing so, we point to advance care planning, through which the patient autonomy of the person concerned can be supported as well as respected in later stages of the disease. If patients adhere to their autonomous wish for PAS, physicians find themselves in an ethical dilemma.

Smell identification did not significantly differ between CHR subjects and controls. Among CHR subjects, smell identification did not predict schizophrenia (N=19; 27%) within 2 years, nor was it associated with negative or positive symptoms. This is the third prospective cohort study to examine smell identification in CHR subjects, and overall, findings are inconclusive, similar to what is found for other disorders in adolescents, such as autism spectrum, attention deficit and anxiety disorders.

These outcomes represent varying aspects of relevance for the day centre context and together create a manifold outcome picture. This was a longitudinal study with approval from the regional research vetting board. Self-report instruments were used, and the investigated predictors motivation for going to the day centre, occupational engagement, socio-demographic factors and self-reported diagnosis. Attendees (N = 108) at 8 day centres participated and filled in self-report questionnaires regarding the predictor and outcome variables. A baseline measurement and a 14-month follow-up composed the data. Occupational engagement at baseline could predict all three outcomes at the follow-up. Motivation for the day centre activities and not preferring work before attending the day centre were positive for satisfaction with the day centre. A low participation rate, although comparable with previous studies on the target group, was a limitation of this study. To conclude, both occupational engagement and motivation are factors that can be stimulated by the staff in day centres.

The largest changes in scores were among Group 2 (the group taking the test on first and last day of their addiction psychiatry rotation).\nThe greatest learning seemed to occur when residents were tested at beginning and end of the rotation. However, all residents' test scores improved to some degree, regardless of their level of training or the timing of the test.\nThis study offers support for testing as a learning guide and as a means of stimulating residents' learning."}, {"Title": "Emotional responses to images of food in adults with an eating disorder: a comparative study with healthy and clinical controls.", "Abstract": "Emotive responses to foods in people with eating disorders are incompletely understood in relation to whether the extent of emotional response is due to the eating disorder or non-specific emotional states. The aims of the present study were to investigate negative and positive emotive responses to food images in adults with an eating disorder, and to compare responses to a (i) healthy and a (ii) clinic (psychiatry) control group. Participants viewed 20 images (16 of foods previously found to evoke fear, disgust and happiness and 4 neutral images) at half-minute intervals and rated emotive responses on 3 visual analogue scales for each image. Participants with an eating disorder (n=26) were found to have significantly increased negative emotive (disgust and fear) responses and reduced positive (happiness) responses to the images compared to the 20 clinic and 61 healthy participants. Differences between groups remained significant when controlling for baseline levels of fear, disgust and happiness. Thus, the emotive responses to foods did not appear due to non-specific increases in anxiety or depression but rather was due to the presence of an eating disorder."}, {"Title": "Neurodevelopmental disorders associated with dosage imbalance of ZBTB20 correlate with the morbidity spectrum of ZBTB20 candidate target genes.", "Abstract": "Recently, a number of patients have been described with structural rearrangements at 3q13.31, delineating a novel microdeletion syndrome with common clinical features including developmental delay and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). A smallest region of overlapping deletions (SRO) involved five RefSeq genes, including the transcription factor gene ZBTB20 and the dopamine receptor gene DRD3, considered as candidate genes for the syndrome.\nWe used array comparative genomic hybridization and next-generation mate-pair sequencing to identify key structural rearrangements involving ZBTB20 in two patients with NDD. In a patient with developmental delay, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, psychosis, Tourette's syndrome and autistic traits, a de novo balanced t(3;18) translocation truncated ZBTB20. The other breakpoint did not disrupt any gene. In a second patient with developmental delay and autism, we detected the first microdeletion at 3q13.31, which truncated ZBTB20 but did not involve DRD3 or the other genes within the previously defined SRO. Zbtb20 directly represses 346 genes in the developing murine brain. Of the 342 human orthologous ZBTB20 candidate target genes, we found 68 associated with NDD. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR, we validated the in vivo binding of Zbtb20 in evolutionary conserved regions in six of these genes (Cntn4, Gad1, Nrxn1, Nrxn3, Scn2a, Snap25).\nOur study links dosage imbalance of ZBTB20 to a range of neurodevelopmental, cognitive and psychiatric disorders, likely mediated by dysregulation of multiple ZBTB20 target genes, and provides new knowledge on the genetic background of the NDD seen in the 3q13.31 microdeletion syndrome."}, {"Title": "Highlights from the 2014 Schizophrenia International Research Society Conference April 5-9, 2014.", "Abstract": "The 2014 Schizophrenia International Research Society (SIRS) Conference, held in Florence, Italy, attracted more than 1,700 attendees from over 55 countries to the stately Firenze Fiera Conference Center from April 5-9, 2014.

The relationship between diet, brain function and the risk of mental disorders has been the subject of intense research in recent years. In this review, we examine some of the potential socioeconomic and environmental challenges detracting from the traditional dietary patterns that might otherwise support positive mental health. In the context of urban expansion, climate change, cultural and technological changes and the global industrialization and ultraprocessing of food, findings related to nutrition and mental health are connected to some of the most pressing issues of our time. The research is also of relevance to matters of biophysiological anthropology. We explore some aspects of a potential evolutionary mismatch between our ancestral past (Paleolithic, Neolithic) and the contemporary nutritional environment. Changes related to dietary acid load, advanced glycation end products and microbiota (via dietary choices and cooking practices) may be of relevance to depression, anxiety and other mental disorders. In particular, the results of emerging studies demonstrate the importance of prenatal and early childhood dietary practices within the developmental origins of health and disease concept. There is still much work to be done before these population studies and their mirrored advances in bench research can provide translation to clinical medicine and public health policy. However, the clear message is that in the midst of a looming global epidemic, we ignore nutrition at our peril."}, {"Title": "Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in a patient with self-neglect associated with severe depression.", "Abstract": "Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder resulting from thiamine deficiency and commonly associated with chronic alcoholism, but we describe the first case report resulting from self-neglect associated with depression."}, {"Title": "Myelination, oligodendrocytes, and serious mental illness.", "Abstract": "Historically, the human brain has been conceptually segregated from the periphery and further dichotomized into gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) based on the whitish appearance of the exceptionally high lipid content of the myelin sheaths encasing neuronal axons. These simplistic dichotomies were unfortunately extended to conceptually segregate neurons from glia, cognition from behavior, and have been codified in the separation of clinical and scientific fields into medicine, psychiatry, neurology, pathology, etc. The discrete classifications have helped obscure the importance of continual dynamic communication between all brain cell types (neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and precursor (NG2) cells) as well as between brain and periphery through multiple signaling systems. The signaling systems range from neurotransmitters to insulin, angiotensin, and multiple kinases such a glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) that together help integrate metabolism, inflammation, and myelination processes and orchestrate the development, plasticity, maintenance, and repair that continually optimize function of neural networks. A more comprehensive, evolution-based, systems biology approach that integrates brain, body, and environmental interactions may ultimately prove more fruitful in elucidating the complexities of human brain function. The historic focus on neurons/GM is rebalanced herein by highlighting the importance of a systems-level understanding of the interdependent age-related shifts in both central and peripheral homeostatic mechanisms that can lead to remarkably prevalent and devastating neuropsychiatric diseases. Herein we highlight the role of glia, especially the most recently evolved oligodendrocytes and the myelin they produce, in achieving and maintaining optimal brain function. The human brain undergoes exceptionally protracted and pervasive myelination (even throughout its GM) and can thus achieve and maintain the rapid conduction and synchronous timing of neural networks on which optimal function depends. The continuum of increasing myelin vulnerability resulting from the human brain's protracted myelination underlies underappreciated communalities between different disease phenotypes ranging from developmental ones such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) to degenerative ones such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). These shared vulnerabilities also expose significant yet underexplored opportunities for novel treatment and prevention approaches that have the potential to considerably reduce the tremendous burden of neuropsychiatric disease."}, {"Title": "Sex differences in first-admission psychiatric inpatients with and without a comorbid substance use disorder.", "Abstract": "We assessed sex differences in a sample of first-admission psychiatric inpatients with and without comorbid substance use disorder (SUD) to identify possible risk factors and targets for sex-tailored treatment interventions.\nA retrospective study of first admissions to the University Psychiatry Ward, \"Maggiore della Carit\u00e0\" Hospital, Novara, Italy, between 2003 and 2012 was accomplished. The clinical charts of patients with (N = 362) and without comorbid SUD (N = 1111) were reviewed.\nDifferences in employment, educational, and marital statuses were found between male and female psychiatric patients with and without comorbid SUD. Having a degree was a protective factor for males, whereas it was a risk factor for females. Being divorced and having family problems were both risk factors for comorbidity in females. Regarding the diagnosis, results overlapped in males and females, and both affective and other disorders were risk factors for a comorbid SUD.\nA significant difference between male and female psychiatric patients with a comorbid SUD was the males' overall poorer psychosocial functioning. Marital status and family problems were risk factors for comorbid SUD in females. Both males and females showed various pathways of access to and choices of substances and, eventually, experienced different impacts on their lives. Hospitalization might help to set up a targeted intervention for patients with comorbidity, while accounting for sex differences. With respect to males, a treatment approach focused on the substance alone might help improve their functioning; females might have a greater benefit from a treatment approach focused on distress, family problems, and relational issues."}, {"Title": "Study of attitudes and practice of physicians regarding consultation-liaison psychiatry in teaching hospitals of mazandaran, iran.", "Abstract": "Consultation-liaison (CL) psychiatry interfaces between psychiatry and other medical disciplines to promote integrated care of patients.

Receiver operating curve statistics were applied.\nHigh SAVRY total and individual subscale scores and low values on the protective factor subscale were significantly associated with subsequent adverse outcomes, but the predictive value of the total score was weak. At the risk item level, those indicating antisocial lifestyle, absence of social support and pro-social involvement were strong indicators of subsequent criminal convictions, with or without violence. The SAVRY summary risk rating was the best indicator of likelihood of being convicted of a violent crime. After allowing for sex, age, psychiatric diagnosis and treatment setting, for example, conviction for a violent crime was over nine times more likely among those young people given high SAVRY summary risk ratings.\nThe SAVRY is a valid and useful method for assessing both short-term and long-term risks of violent and non-violent crime by young people in psychiatric as well as criminal justice settings, adding to a traditional risk-centred assessment approach by also indicating where future preventive treatment efforts should be targeted.

This is problematic as the targets of workplace bullying may need psychiatric treatment; as a discipline, therefore psychiatrists may benefit from a deeper understanding of the nature of workplace bullying and its sequelae.\nThere is still no agreed upon definition, although most definitions include similar criteria. Managers and human resources personnel frequently have difficulty identifying and effectively managing workplace bullying. The consequences for the targets of bullying can be severe; they may need psychiatric treatment and it can have a lifelong impact. There is a paucity of research into effective prevention and intervention programs. Preventive measures that focus on the whole workplace culture or on targets alone have mixed results. Workplace policies and procedures may lessen the prevalence and incidence of bullying, but often competing interests of senior management, human resources personnel, supervisors and workers may mitigate any antibullying interventions.\nAlthough psychiatrists are likely to treat the targets of bullying, bullying has yet to attract much attention as a research topic in psychiatry.

Main outcome measures included trainee satisfaction, and SBIRT knowledge, perceived self-efficacy, and self- and observer report of use of the SBIRT algorithm.\nAmong 150 total participants completing the SBIRT training modules, nearly all (92.3%) were satisfied/very satisfied with the training modules.

Confidence ratings also declined over time. Use of the SBIRT algorithm during the Adolescent Medicine rotation was high according to trainee self- and faculty observer report.\nWe found evidence of training satisfaction, increased confidence in talking to adolescents about substance use, and widespread use of recommended practices immediately following training. Use of a highly structured algorithm to guide practice, and simple, highly structured brief interventions was a successful training approach, as residents self-reported accurate use of the SBIRT algorithm immediately after training.

Nevertheless, any thorough training in psychotherapy in Greece lacks planning and a credible certification system. \u03a4raining is carried out by different psychotherapeutic societies of varying prestige, through a number of programs. There have been very few attempts until now to map this field. The Section of Psychotherapy of the Hellenic Psychiatric Association (HPA) has tried to document the characteristics of the psychiatrists practicing psychotherapy. The study aimed at all of the trainee and trained psychiatrists, members of HPA. 210 questionnaires were filled in by members of HPA in 2000 and 2009-2011. Most of them were returned by post to the Section of Psychotherapy, while some were filled in during the 21rst HPA congress. With regard to psychotherapeutic training 151 (72%) reported some kind of psychoanalytic training, 90 (42.8%) cognitive, 85 (40.5%) systemic and 38 (18%) other (interpersonal, drama therapy, existentialist, cognitive-analytic, hypnosis, group therapy of another kind, orgonotherapy, vegetotherapy, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing).

Interestingly, many of the participants reported more than one types of psychotherapeutic training. Another important finding is the fact that the range of training varies from a single seminar to many years, something which underlines the considerable divergence with regard to what is considered psychotherapeutic training. Several questions arise from the above findings: A first one is if a psychiatrist should, during his/her training, also be trained in psychotherapy and what kind of training this should be. A second question is if being a trained psychiatrist entails the capacity to practice psychotherapy and to be called a psychotherapist. Should the title of psychotherapist be a general one or should a specific theoretical-clinical approach be mentioned in the title (psychoanalyst, cognitive-behavioral, systemic, etc.). One more question is which institution is appropriate for the certification of a psychotherapist: a state authority or another, possibly private, institution such as scientific societies or Non-Governmental Organizations? A final question is where professionals from different fields certified as psychotherapists could converge and how their differences could be specified. The mapping and study of the field of psychotherapy within HPA can create the basis for a fruitful discussion on the issue of the psychiatrists' training and certification in psychotherapy, thus outlining a number of questions and dilemmas."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric evaluation of women who were assisted at a university referral center in Campinas, Brazil, following an experience of sexual violence.", "Abstract": "To present the sociodemographic characteristics and psychiatric symptoms of women who have been raped.\nBetween 2006 and 2010, a retrospective study was conducted of 468 women who underwent psychiatric evaluation at a university referral center in Brazil after an experience of sexual violence.\nThe women had a mean age of 24.1 years; were predominantly white, unmarried, childless, and employed; had 9-11 years of education; and had a religion.

This paper reviews these connections and provides a context by which multiple risk factors for schizophrenia may be related. Epidemiological studies strongly link schizophrenia with autoimmune disorders including enteropathic celiac disease. Exposure to wheat gluten and bovine milk casein also contribute to non-celiac food sensitivities in susceptible individuals. Co-morbid GI inflammation accompanies humoral immunity to food antigens, occurs early during the course of schizophrenia and appears to be independent from antipsychotic-generated motility effects. This inflammation impacts endothelial barrier permeability and can precipitate translocation of gut bacteria into systemic circulation. Infection by the neurotropic gut pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii, will elicit an inflammatory GI environment. Such processes trigger innate immunity, including activation of complement C1q, which also functions at synapses in the brain. The emerging field of microbiome research lies at the center of these interactions with evidence that the abundance and diversity of resident gut microbiota contribute to digestion, inflammation, gut permeability and behavior. Dietary modifications of core bacterial compositions may explain inefficient gluten digestion and how immigrant status in certain situations is a risk factor for schizophrenia. Gut microbiome research in schizophrenia is in its infancy, but data in related fields suggest disease-associated altered phylogenetic compositions. In summary, this review surveys associative and experimental data linking autoimmunity, GI activity and schizophrenia, and proposes that understanding of disrupted biological pathways outside of the brain can lend valuable information regarding pathogeneses of complex, polygenic brain disorders."}, {"Title": "Pre-existing hyperlipidaemia increased the risk of new-onset anxiety disorders after traumatic brain injury: a 14-year population-based study.", "Abstract": "Anxiety disorders (ADs) are common after traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Utilizing the key word 'demoralization' in PubMed and PsycINFO databases, an electronic search was performed, supplemented by Web of Science and manual searches. Study selection criteria included the assessment of medical patients and use of instruments validated to assess demoralization. Seventy-four studies were selected.\nFour instruments emerged in the literature. Main findings concern prevalence rates of demoralization, evidence of discriminant validity from major depression, factors associated with demoralization and evidence of clinical utility. The instruments vary in their definition, the populations they aim to assess, prevalence rates they estimate and their ability to discriminate between different conditions. Nonetheless, demoralization appears to be a distinctive psychological state characterized by helplessness, hopelessness, giving up and subjective incompetence. It is not limited to life-threatening diseases such as cancer, but may occur in any type of clinical situation. It is associated with stress and adverse health outcomes.\nStudies addressing the incremental value of demoralization in psychiatry and psychology are needed.

Recently, psychiatry has made significant inroads into hospice and palliative care, and in doing so brings with it the conviction that dying patients who seek to end their suffering by asserting control over the time and manner of their inevitable death should be provided with psychotherapeutic measures rather than having their expressed wishes respected as though their desire for an earlier death were the rational choice of someone with decisional capacity. This article reviews and critiques this approach from the perspective of recent clinical data indicating that patients who secure and utilize a lethal prescription are generally exercising an autonomous choice unencumbered by clinical depression or other forms of incapacitating mental illness."}, {"Title": "Validation of the Thai QOL-AD version in Alzheimer's patients and caregivers.", "Abstract": "Quality of life (QOL) plays an important role in determining the improvement of patient care in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Building an epidemiological canon within WHO's Mental Health Programme faced numerous obstacles. First, an idealist notion of mental health inherent in WHO's own definition of health contributed to tensions around the object of psychiatric epidemiology. Second, the transfer of methods from medical epidemiology to research on mental disorders required mobilizing conceptual justifications, including a 'contagion argument'. Third, epidemiological research at WHO was stymied by other public health needs, resource scarcity and cultural barriers. This history partly recapitulates the development of psychiatric epidemiology in North America and Europe, but is also shaped by concerns in the developing world, translated through first-world 'experts'. Resolving the tensions arising from these obstacles allowed WHO to establish its international schizophrenia research, which in turn provided proof of concept for psychiatric epidemiology in the place of scepticism within and without psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Social disorder and diagnostic order: the US Mental Hygiene Movement, the Midtown Manhattan study and the development of psychiatric epidemiology in the 20th century.", "Abstract": "Recent scholarship regarding psychiatric epidemiology has focused on shifting notions of mental disorders. In psychiatric epidemiology in the last decades of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, mental disorders have been perceived and treated largely as discrete categories denoting an individual's mental functioning as either pathological or normal. In the USA, this grew partly out of evolving modern epidemiological work responding to the State's commitment to measure the national social and economic burdens of psychiatric disorders and subsequently to determine the need for mental health services and to survey these needs over time. Notably absent in these decades have been environmentally oriented approaches to cultivating normal, healthy mental states, approaches initially present after World War II. We focus here on a set of community studies conducted in the 1950s, particularly the Midtown Manhattan study, which grew out of a holistic conception of mental health that depended on social context and had a strong historical affiliation with: the Mental Hygiene Movement and the philosophy of its founder, Adolf Meyer; the epidemiological formation of field studies and population surveys beginning early in the 20th century, often with a health policy agenda; the recognition of increasing chronic disease in the USA; and the radical change in orientation within psychiatry around World War II.

In addition, program directors were asked to share specific challenges in implementing the new handoff regulations as well as their view on how the new regulations would impact patient care.\nOf the 177 recipients, 108 completed at least part of the survey (61 % response rate). Only 11.4 % of programs indicated that they did not need to make any changes to their program in order to meet the new guidelines. Approximately a third of survey respondents reported that they did not yet have a formal curriculum in handoffs (32.4 %) and/or did not specifically assess competence at handoffs (30.5 %). Program directors cited the challenge of working with a variety of clinical settings with unique cultures, infrastructure, and policies and procedures and suggested that implementation and ownership of handoff training and assessment should be at the level of the clinical services. Despite these challenges, most program directors agreed that the new ACGME requirements would improve patient care and safety.\nThe high frequency of programs without established handoff curricula or competence evaluations highlights the potential value of published resources and tools to provide standardized training and assessment in handoffs. The results also underscore the importance of developing training and assessment in close collaboration with the clinical services and recognizing the need to tailor handoff communications to address the types of transitions that occur within each clinical setting."}, {"Title": "Preparing residents in training to become health-care leaders: a pilot project.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to describe a successful and exportable training module that addresses Next Accreditation System (NAS) behavioral milestones for leadership competencies.\nA novel leadership training module, which required the creation of original business plans by teams of residents, was incorporated into a psychiatry PGY-2 training curriculum.\nIn the creation and presentation of their business plans, the residents demonstrated competencies in the NAS functional domains of interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism, practice-based learning and improvement, and systems-based practice.

The methods it uses to further this aim include bilateral meetings, seminars, and annual symposia. In view of its historical roots, the PNTZP is constantly mindful of the excesses perpetrated on the mentally ill during the National Socialist period, and believes it has an obligation to promote a brand of psychiatry founded on the person, respect for human dignity, and the will and individuality of every man. For this reason, ethics are an essential element of discussion, including discussions with patients and their families. The society advocates the implementation of the National Programme of Mental Health Care and the development of community psychiatry in Poland. It supports the development of various structures for the treatment and assistance of people with mental illness, as well as scientific and academic reflection on the social and cultural implications of psychiatric thought and action. It is committed to facilitating the exchange of experiences between different professional groups, patients, and their families in order to promote mutual inspiration and support in the challenging task of developing psychiatry. A record of these years of meetings may be found in the twenty issues of the periodical Dialog. This example of cooperation across official state borders may be held up as a benchmark for the development of European psychiatry, and the joint work and discussions may offer help and inspiration in day-to-day therapeutic practice. The PNTZP is open to new people and initiatives, and is always looking for people willing to get involved in its work."}, {"Title": "[Research and treatment of war neuroses at the Clinic for Nervous and Mental Diseases at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow before World War II in the context of psychiatry in Europe].", "Abstract": "The aim of this article is to offer an overview of the research into diagnosis and treatment of war neuroses at the Clinic for Nervous and Mental Diseases at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow before the outbreak of World War II. It also includes a profile of the work of Prof. Jan Piltz, the then director of the Clinic, and his major scientific achievements. The publications cited in the article date in the main from the period of World War I, and comprise clinical analyses of the consequences of stress suffered at the front as well as a description of the ways in which they were treated. These are presented alongside other major findings related to war neuroses being made in Europe at the time. The article draws attention to the very modern thinking on treatment of war neuroses, far ahead of the average standards of the day, evinced by Prof. Piltz and his team. The most important innovative elements of their treatment of these conditions were the fact that they perceived the cause of the neurosis to lie in previous personality disorders in the patients, their recommendation of psychotherapy as the main method of treatment, and their emphasis on the need for further rehabilitation following the completion of the course of hospital treatment. They also paid significant attention to the importance of drawing up individual therapy plans for each patient."}, {"Title": "[Bipolar and related disorders and depressive disorders in DSM-5].", "Abstract": "In 2013, a version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), having number 5, was published. The DSM is a textbook which aims to present diagnostic criteria for each psychiatric disorder recognized by the U.S. healthcare system. The DSM-5 comprises the most updated diagnostic criteria of psychiatric disorders as well as their description, and provides a common language for clinicians to communicate about the patients. Diagnostic criteria of the DSM-5 have been popular all over the world, including countries where the ICD-10 classification is obligatory, and are widely used for clinical and neurobiological research in psychiatry. In this article, two chapters of the DSM-5 pertained to mood (affective) disorders are presented, such as \"Bipolar and related disorders\" and \"Depressive disorders\" replacing the chapter titled \"Mood disorders\" in the previous version of DSM-IV. The aim of this article is to discuss a structure of new classification, to point out differences compared with previous version (DSM-IV). New diagnostic categories, such as e.g. disruptive mood dysregulation disorder or premenstrual dysphoric disorder were depicted as well as some elements of dimensional approach to mood disorders were presented."}, {"Title": "Low vision depression prevention trial in age-related macular degeneration: a randomized clinical trial.", "Abstract": "To compare the efficacy of behavior activation (BA) + low vision rehabilitation (LVR) with supportive therapy (ST) + LVR to prevent depressive disorders in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\nSingle-masked, attention-controlled, randomized, clinical trial with outcome assessment at 4 months.\nPatients with AMD and subsyndromal depressive symptoms attending retina practices (n = 188).\nBefore randomization, all subjects had 2 outpatient LVR visits, and were then randomized to in-home BA+LVR or ST+LVR. Behavior activation is a structured behavioral treatment that aims to increase adaptive behaviors and achieve valued goals. Supportive therapy is a nondirective, psychological treatment that provides emotional support and controls for attention.\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV defined depressive disorder based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (primary outcome), Activities Inventory, National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionnaire-25 plus Supplement (NEI-VFQ), and NEI-VFQ quality of life (secondary outcomes).\nAt 4 months, 11 BA+LVR subjects (12.6%) and 18 ST+LVR subjects (23.4%) developed a depressive disorder (relative risk [RR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.27-1.06; P = 0.067). In planned adjusted analyses the RR was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.27-0.98; P = 0.04). A mediational analysis suggested that BA+LVR prevented depression to the extent that it enabled subjects to remain socially engaged. In addition, BA+LVR was associated with greater improvements in functional vision than ST+LVR, although there was no significant between-group difference. There was no significant change or between-group difference in quality of life.\nAn integrated mental health and low vision intervention halved the incidence of depressive disorders relative to standard outpatient LVR in patients with AMD. As the population ages, the number of persons with AMD and the adverse effects of comorbid depression will increase.

Implemented in 2004 to foster primary care skills, the comprehensive rotation program (CRP) requires junior residents to spend 14 months rotating through a comprehensive array of clinical departments including internal medicine, surgery, anesthesiology, obstetrics-gynecology (OBGYN), pediatrics, psychiatry, and rural medicine. In 2010, Japan's health ministry relaxed this curricular requirement, allowing training programs to offer a limited rotation program (LRP), in which core departments constitute 10 months of training, with electives geared towards residents' choice of career specialty comprising the remaining 14 months. The effectiveness of primary care skill acquisition during early training warrants evaluation. This study assesses self-reported confidence with clinical competencies, as well as case experience, between residents in CRP versus LRP curricula.\nA nation-wide cross-sectional study of all PGY2 physicians in Japan was conducted in March 2011. Primary outcomes were self-report confidence for 98 clinical competency items, and number of cases experienced for 85 common diseases. We compared confidence scores and case experience between residents in CRP and LRP programs, adjusting for parameters relevant to training.\nAmong 7506 PGY2 residents, 5052 replied to the survey (67.3%). Of 98 clinical competency items, CRP residents reported higher confidence in 12 items compared to those in an LRP curriculum, 10 of which remained significantly higher after adjustment. CRP trainees reported lower confidence scores in none of the items. Out of 85 diseases, LRP residents reported less experience with 11 diseases. CRP trainees reported lower case experience with one disease, though this did not remain significant on adjusted analysis. Confidence and case experience with OBGYN- and pediatrics-related items were particularly low among LRP trainees.\nResidents in the specialty-oriented LRP curriculum showed less confidence and less case experience compared to peers training in the broader CRP residency curriculum.

Such mentally ill people are characterized as having deficient, dysfunctional, or absent coping skills. Recently, researchers have exerted considerable effort to distinguish between productive and nonproductive coping. In this article, we argue that not only are such conceptualizations reliant on reductive, circular logic, but they also miss the essentially rational, local, and individual nature of coping in psychiatric patients' lives. We used semistructured interviews and thematic analyses of psychiatric patients' descriptions of their coping. Patients reported that professional intervention reduced their ability to cope, that they distrusted the mental health system and its professionals, that coping mechanisms were misinterpreted, that situational crises modulated coping, and that sometimes coping was just \"not coping.\" We argue for a more respectful, nuanced understanding of coping among mental health professionals."}, {"Title": "Assessment of the therapeutic alliance of youth and parents with team members in youth residential psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Although therapeutic alliance is widely acknowledged as a key component for therapeutic change, its role is almost unknown in youth residential psychiatry.

Internal reliability and validity were good for most of the subscales. The hypothesis that team members would show low levels of agreement in their reports of the therapeutic alliance was confirmed, demonstrating the need to include multiple team members in assessment procedures. Overall, this study underscores the psychometric properties of the Dutch version of the FEQ.

A critical review and recommendation of a unified guideline.", "Abstract": "The discipline of psychiatry has a plethora of guidelines, designed to serve the needs of the clinician. Yet, even a cursory glance is enough to discern the differences between the various guidelines. This paper reviews the current standard guidelines being followed across the world and proposes a unified guideline on the backbone of current evidence and practice being followed. The algorithm for pharmacological and psychosocial treatment for bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia is formulated after cross-comparison across four different guidelines and recent meta-analytical evidence. For every disorder, guidelines have different suggestions. Hence, based on the current status of evidence, algorithms have been combined to form a unified guideline for management. Clinical practice guidelines form the basis of standard clinical practice for all disciplines of medicine, including psychiatry. Yet, they are often not read or followed because of poor quality or because of barriers to implementation due to either lack of agreement or ambiguity.

A large majority of respondents agreed with the need for more neuroscience education in general and with respect to their own training. Most respondents believed that neuroscience will help destigmatize mental illness and begin producing new treatments or personalized medicines in 5-10 years. Only a small proportion of trainees and psychiatrists, however, reported a strong knowledge base in neuroscience. Respondents also reported broad enthusiasm for transdiagnostic topics in neuroscience (such as emotion regulation and attention/cognition) and description at the level of neural circuits.\nThis study demonstrates the opportunity and enthusiasm for teaching more neuroscience in psychiatry among a broad range of stakeholder groups. A high level of interest was also found for transdiagnostic topics and approaches.

Jean Martin Charcot's devotion to mesmerism for treating hysterical patients evoked the invention of psychoanalysis by Sigmund Freud. Meanwhile, Joseph Babinski took over the challenge to discriminate between organic and hysterical patients from Charcot and found Babinski's sign, the greatest milestone in modern neurological symptomatology. Nowadays, the usage of the term hysteria is avoided. However, new terms and new classifications are complicated and inconsistent between the two representative taxonomies, the DSM-IV and ICD-10. In the ICD-10, even the alternative term conversion disorder, which was becoming familiar to neurologists, has also disappeared as a group name. The diagnosis of hysteria remains important in clinical neurology. Extensive exclusive diagnoses and over investigation, including various imaging studies, should be avoided because they may prolong the disease course and fix their symptoms. Psychological reasons that seem to explain the conversion are not considered reliable. Positive neurological signs suggesting nonorganic etiologies are the most reliable measures for diagnosing hysteria, as Babinski first argued. Hysterical paresis has several characteristics, such as giving-way weakness or peculiar distributions of weakness. Signs to uncover nonorganic paresis utilizing synergy include Hoover's test and the Sonoo abductor test."}, {"Title": "Bacterial neuroactive compounds produced by psychobiotics.", "Abstract": "We recently coined the phrase 'psychobiotics' to describe an emerging class of probiotics of relevance to psychiatry [Dinan et al., Biol Psychiatry 2013;74(10):720-726].

Consequently, he explicitly recommended sleep deprivation as a therapy for \"melancholia,\" the contemporary name for depressive disorders. This finding is of apparent relevance to the history of psychiatry and sleep medicine. One should nonetheless bear in mind that the passages summarized below are scattered throughout Heinroth's famous Textbook of Psychiatry of 1818 and other works, and that Heinroth never elaborated on this issue systematically. Moreover, his statements promote the impression that they were the result of vague impressions and thoughts, and that Heinroth did not benefit from extensive experience. Yet what is important to note is that he regarded sleep deprivation as a feasible treatment option only for patients whose depression had recently been diagnosed."}, {"Title": "Effectiveness of an educational handbook in improving psychiatry resident knowledge of second-generation antipsychotics.", "Abstract": "The authors describe a pilot evaluation of an educational handbook designed to increase resident knowledge of second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) use in the pediatric population, with an emphasis on metabolic monitoring.\nAn educational handbook focusing on SGA use in children and adolescents was introduced to psychiatry residents undergoing a child psychiatry rotation. Baseline and post-intervention questionnaires were administered to determine whether SGA knowledge increased.\nBaseline and post-intervention questionnaires were completed by 32 residents. At baseline, most residents (92.9 %) had interacted with an adult patient requiring an SGA and had prescribed SGAs at least five times (70.9 %) in the previous month. Baseline SGA knowledge was limited such that only 5.4 % of participants scored greater than 80 %, and 28.6 % scored below 60 %. Mean total score improved significantly from pre-test (18.4 \u00b1 4.23) to post-test (21.2 \u00b1 3.28, p = 0.001). Stratified analysis suggested a significant improvement of scores (post-test versus pre-test, respectively) in females (21.8 \u00b1 3.11 versus 18.0 \u00b1 4.94, p = 0.003) and junior residents (21.3 \u00b1 3.34 versus 18.1 \u00b1 4.37, p = 0.001). While significant improvements were documented in questions related to Health Canada-approved and other off-label evidence-based indications, and the appropriate physical examination components and laboratory tests to perform at SGA initiation and follow-up, no improvements were documented regarding the distinguishing properties, side effects, and appropriate history-taking prior to SGA initiation.\nImplementation of an educational handbook can improve resident knowledge related to SGA use in children over the short-term. However, future research should be directed at the effectiveness of more interactive web-based formats in optimizing learning for male residents and ensuring more comprehensive knowledge uptake. While the introduction of an education handbook is the first step in addressing some of the barriers to metabolic monitoring, prospective longitudinal studies are required to determine whether such an intervention will ultimately improve prescriber adherence over the long-term."}, {"Title": "Mothers' alexithymia, depression and anxiety levels and their association with the quality of mother-infant relationship: a preliminary study.", "Abstract": "To evaluate the relationship between mothers and their developmentally normal infants in terms of maternal alexithymia, depression and anxiety, and marital satisfaction.\nFifty children between 18 and 48 months of age, and their mothers, were referred consecutively to the Infant Mental Health Unit of Ankara University School of Medicine, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. The sociodemographic features of the families and the depressive symptoms, anxiety, marital satisfaction and alexithymia levels of the mothers were assessed.

Mothers with high alexithymia showed higher depression and lower relationship qualities than mothers with low alexithymia, according to the correlation analysis. When depression and anxiety were controlled, high alexithymia levels were predictive of a low, impaired mother-infant relationship.\nSince alexithymia is a trait-like variable which has a negative correlation with impairment in a mother-infant relationship, it must be investigated in the assessment of mothers' interactions with their babies."}, {"Title": "MRI predicts remission at 1 year in first-episode schizophrenia in females with larger striato-thalamic volumes.", "Abstract": "The Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group has defined remission as 'a low-mild symptom intensity level, maintained for a minimum of 6 months, where such symptoms do not affect an individual's behaviour' [Andreasen et al.: Am J Psychiatry 2005;162:441-449].

Based on this report, the \"5-year plan for promoting dementia measures (\"Orange Plan\")\" was released on September 5. The Orange Plan clearly aims to limit the roles of psychiatry in dementia care to the management of behavioral and psychological symptoms, and to minimize the involvement of psychiatry through implementation of stricter requirements for hospitalization and measures for facilitating discharge. Based on my experience, many of the patients making initial visits to outpatient clinics specializing in dementia are relatively mild cases, and they are typically aware of their condition. Among patients admitted to psychiatric wards, those in acute wards are mostly relatively young men. while those in wards for long-term care comprise mostly elderly women with complications. As opposed to the needs of patients in dementia, the medical needs recognized by policymakers are the needs of the care providers. I have stated that, based on the needs of patients, medical care for dementia should be divided as follows: early diagnosis; early psychiatric and psychological support for patients ; management of behavioral and psychological symptoms; medical care for complications; and terminal care. Furthermore, psychiatrists should be actively involved at each stage. I have also emphasized that providing high-quality psychiatric support for patients with anxiety during the mild phase of cognitive dysfunction greatly influences the subsequent course of illness."}, {"Title": "Preliminary and ongoing French multicenter prospective naturalistic study of adverse events of antipsychotic treatment in naive children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "The prescription of antipsychotics (AP), and especially second generation AP, is increasing worldwide in the pediatric population. Most prescriptions are off-label and despite the identification of frequent and potentially severe adverse events (AE), there are only a few guidelines for the safety management. France is one of the countries with no official safety guidelines.\nPsychotropic drug-naive adolescents (13-18 years), hospitalized for an acute psychotic episode and treated with a second-generation antipsychotic were consecutively included in a prospective cohort study. Patients were assessed for their AE at baseline, 2, 6 and 12\u00a0weeks after the introduction of drug.\nThe majority of patients was treated with risperidone (n\u2009=\u200913), 2 with aripiprazole. The principal findings are: (1) A high incidence of neuromuscular AE: 8/15 muscle weakness, 8/15 extrapyramidal syndrome, 6/15 akathisia, 3/15 oro-facial acute dystonia; (2) Severe catatonia symptoms in 2 patients despite a low to moderate treatment dose, requiring transfer in intensive care unit for one; (3) Weight gain and significant increase of the BMI for all 13 patients who had a 12\u00a0weeks follow-up.\nAll adolescents experienced AE, with significant weight gain being observed in all patients who completed the 12-week follow-up. The fact that our patient population was first episode drug na\u00efve may partially explain this observation. Despite the limitation due to the small sample size of this prospective short-term study, such findings are important to report and warrant further research.\nBecause of the lack of naturalistic follow up studies of antipsychotic treatments in AP-naive children and adolescents and the absence of safety guidelines for the pediatric population in France, we decided to continue our research at a national level. We therefore started a prospective, naturalistic and multicenter study funded by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM).

Of these 840 patients, 724 (86.2%) were treated with antipsychotic monotherapy, and 116 (13.8%) were treated with antipsychotic polypharmacy. Positive correlations with antipsychotic polypharmacy were observed for placement or custody outside the biological family; a greater number of previous psychiatric admissions; longer hospitalizations; admission for violence/aggression or psychosis; and intellectual disability, psychotic, disruptive behavior, or developmental disorder diagnoses. Negative correlations with antipsychotic polypharmacy included admission for suicidal ideation/attempt or depression, and mood disorder diagnoses. Significant predictors of antipsychotic polypharmacy included admission for violence or aggression (odds ratio [OR] 2.76 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36-5.61]), greater number of previous admissions (OR 1.21 [95% CI 1.10-1.33]), and longer hospitalizations (OR 1.08 [95% CI 1.04-1.12]).

This situation begs the question, what role is there for the anthropology of mental health? In this essay, I contend that there are three essential roles for the anthropology of mental health in an era of biological psychiatry. These roles are to (i) provide a meaningful critique of practices, beliefs, and movements within current psychiatry; (ii) illuminate the socio-cultural, clinical, and familial context of suffering and healing regarding emotional distress/mental illness; and (iii) act as a catalyst for positive change regarding healing, services and provisions for people with emotional distress/mental illness. My argument is unified by my contention that a credible anthropology of mental health intending to make a societal contribution should offer no opposition without proposition. In other words, any critique must be counter-balanced by the detailing of solutions and proposals for change. This will ensure that the anthropology of mental health continues to contribute critical knowledge to the understanding of mental suffering, distress, and healing. Such social and cultural approaches are becoming especially important given the widespread disenchantment with an increasingly dominant biological psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Patients with very-late-onset schizoprhenia-like psychosis have higher mortality rates than elderly patients with earlier onset schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "In this register-based study of schizophrenia patients aged 65 years or above, mortality and causes of death diagnosed at age of 60+ (very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis, VLOSLP) were studied in comparison with sex- and age-matched general Finnish population. Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) of VLOSLP patients were also compared with those of earlier onset (below 60 years) schizophrenia patients, and hazard of death was calculated between these patient groups.\nThe data was obtained from Finnish nationwide registers and consisted of 918 VLOSLP patients and 6142 earlier onset patients who were at least 65 years on 1 January 1999. The register-based follow-up for mortality covered 10 years between 1999 and 2008.\nOverall SMR was 5.02 (4.61-5.46) in the group of VLOSLP patients and 2.93 (2.83-3.03) in the group of earlier onset patients.

In most U.S. states, however, these voluntary admissions abridge the rights of patients through legal provisions that limit the conditions under which patients can be discharged upon their request. This phenomenon, including variations in the state laws governing requests for discharge from voluntary psychiatric hospitalization, has received little attention in the psychiatry literature. Using Lexis-Nexis, PubMed, and Web of Science, we conducted a review of state laws regarding patients' legal rights to request discharge from voluntary hospitalization. Our hypothesis was that most states would have provisions limiting access to immediate discharge for patients whose psychiatric admission had been voluntary. Our findings from the review indicate that 49 of the 51 jurisdictions (50 states plus the District of Columbia) have provisions about patients requesting discharge from voluntary psychiatric admission. The majority of states employ a 72-hour period in which patients can be held following a request for discharge from hospitalization. As a general rule, after this evaluation period, either the patient must be discharged, or the facility must initiate involuntary commitment proceedings. Given these provisions, we explore the range of clinical admission procedures and whether voluntary admissions are truly voluntary.

The ethical consequences of the anthropological renewal are being discussed respective to some practical situations: 1. The doctor - patient - relatives relationship embedding the activity of the interested parties; 2. mental disorders as relationship disorders; 3. ethical orientation towards the normative ambiguity of self-determination and \"being meaningful for others\"; 4. the consequences for the post-industrial concept of man; 5. the ethics of self-help groups; and 6. the challenge of inclusion for ethics and human rights."}, {"Title": "Compliance with trial registration in five core journals of clinical geriatrics: a survey of original publications on randomised controlled trials from 2008 to 2012.", "Abstract": "to assess the proportion of registered randomised controlled trials in five core clinical geriatric journals and to analyse whether registered study outcomes correspond with published outcomes.\nsurvey of original papers published 2008 to 2012.\ntwo independent reviewers retrieved the sample through search in the web-based archives of Age and Ageing, the Journal of the American Geriatric Society, the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, the Journal of the American Medical Directors Association and International Psychogeriatrics.

We contrasted both lifetime frequencies of DSM-IV criterion A (the core symptom criterion of the internationally recognized DSM classification system) symptoms and types/content of delusions and hallucinations in transethnic schizophrenia populations from Australia (n\u00a0=\u00a0776), India (n\u00a0=\u00a0504) and Sarawak, Malaysia (n\u00a0=\u00a0259), to elucidate clinical heterogeneity. Differences in both criterion A symptom composition and symptom content were apparent. Indian individuals with schizophrenia reported negative symptoms more frequently than other sites, whereas individuals from Sarawak reported disorganized symptoms more frequently. Delusions of control and thought broadcast, insertion, or withdrawal were less frequent in Sarawak than Australia. Curiously, a subgroup of 20 Indian individuals with schizophrenia reported no lifetime delusions or hallucinations. These findings potentially challenge the long-held view in psychiatry that schizophrenia is fundamentally similar across cultural groups, with differences in only the content of psychotic symptoms, but equivalence in structural form."}, {"Title": "Variation in long-term antipsychotic polypharmacy and high-dose prescribing across physicians and hospitals.", "Abstract": "This study had two aims: to measure the prevalence of long-term prescribing of high doses of antipsychotics and antipsychotic polypharmacy in a large Canadian province and to estimate the relative contributions of patient-, physician-, and hospital-level factors.\nGovernment hospital discharge, physician, and pharmaceutical claims data were linked to identify individuals with schizophrenia who in 2004 had antipsychotics available to them for at least 11 months. Individuals on a high dose throughout that period, as well as individuals on multiple concurrent antipsychotics (polypharmacy), were identified. Logistic and generalized linear mixed models using patient-, physician-, and hospital-level predictors were estimated.\nAmong the 12,150 individuals identified, 11.9% were on a high dose and 10.4% on antipsychotic polypharmacy continually, with 3.7% in both groups. After adjustment for potential confounders, analyses showed that systematic propensity for physicians to prescribe high doses accounted for 10.9% of the remaining unexplained variance, and physicians as a group who prescribed high doses across a hospital or psychiatry department accounted for 3.0%. For antipsychotic polypharmacy the corresponding percentages were 9.7% and 6.2%. Even after adjustment, the variation in high-dose prescribing and antipsychotic polypharmacy remained substantial.\nLong-term high-dose and antipsychotic polypharmacy prescribing appeared partly driven by some physicians' and some hospitals' propensities to prescribe in this way independently of patient characteristics. Given the weight of the evidence against high-dose prescribing and antipsychotic polypharmacy, measures addressed to physicians and hospitals most likely to prescribe high doses, antipsychotic polypharmacy, or both should be considered."}, {"Title": "The relationship between area deprivation and contact with community intellectual disability psychiatry.", "Abstract": "People with intellectual disabilities (ID) have high rates of psychiatric illness and are known to live in more deprived areas than the general population.

The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) were determined for the patient sample and for the general population living in the same area.\nBetween 1 June 2012 and 1 June 2013, 184 patients were seen by ID psychiatry over a total of 553 contacts, with valid SIMD data for 179 patients and 543 contacts. Fifty-two per cent of patients (n = 93) lived in the most deprived SIMD decile, and 90.5% (n = 152) in the lowest 5 deciles.

Given the high psychiatric morbidity of people with ID, if services do not adjust for deprivation, this may lead to further discrimination in an already disadvantaged population."}, {"Title": "A favorable risk-benefit analysis of high dose thyroid for treatment of bipolar disorders with regard to osteoporosis.", "Abstract": "High dose thyroid hormone has been in use since the 1930s for the treatment of affective disorders. Despite numerous papers showing benefit, the lack of negative trials and its inclusion in multiple treatment guidelines, high dose thyroid has yet to find wide spread use. The major objection to the use of high dose thyroid is the myth that it causes osteoporosis. This paper reviews the literature surrounding the use of high dose thyroid, both in endocrinology and in psychiatry. High dose thyroid does not appear to be a significant risk factor for osteoporosis while other widely employed psychiatric medications do pose a risk. Psychiatrists are uniquely qualified to do the risk-benefit analyses of high dose thyroid for the treatment of the bipolar I, bipolar II and bipolar NOS. Other specialties do not have the requisite knowledge of the risks of alterative medications or of the mortality and morbidity of the bipolar disorders to do a full risk benefit analysis."}, {"Title": "ADHD and pregnancy.", "Abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been increasingly recognized and treated in children and adults in recent years. As a result, a growing number of women enter their reproductive years treated with medication for ADHD or are diagnosed and start medication during their reproductive years. A common question in perinatal psychiatry regards the risk-benefit profile of pharmacotherapy for ADHD, particularly with stimulants. At this time, there are no guidelines to inform the treatment of ADHD across pregnancy and the postpartum period. Concerns about in utero exposure to stimulants are based primarily on the impact these medications might have on fetal growth. While stimulants do not appear to be associated with major congenital malformations, more human data regarding potential behavioral teratogenicity are needed in order to understand both the short- and long-term risks. Severity of illness, presence of comorbid disorders, and degree of impairment have an impact on treatment decisions. Crucial considerations include driving safety and ability to function in occupational roles. While most women can successfully avoid the use of stimulant medication during pregnancy, there are cases in which the benefits of stimulant treatment outweigh known and putative risks of in utero medication exposure."}, {"Title": "Characteristics of adolescents subjected to restraint in acute psychiatric units in Norway: a case-control study.", "Abstract": "Use of restraint in psychiatric treatment is controversial. This study compared social, mental health, and treatment characteristics of restrained and nonrestrained adolescents in acute psychiatric inpatient units.\nIn a retrospective case-control design, we included all adolescents restrained during 2008-2010 (N=288) in all acute psychiatric inpatient units that accepted involuntarily admitted adolescents in Norway (N=16). A control group (N=288) of nonrestrained adolescent patients was randomly selected from the same units. Restraint included mechanical restraint, pharmacological restraint, seclusion, and physical holding. Data sources were electronic patient records and restraint protocols. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to predict restraint use.\nCompared with nonrestrained adolescents, restrained adolescents were more likely to be immigrants, to live in institutions or foster care, and to have had involvement with child protection services. The restrained adolescents were more likely to have psychotic, eating, or externalizing disorders and lower scores on the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). They had multiple admissions and longer stays and were more often involuntarily referred. When the analysis adjusted for age, gender, living arrangements, child protection services involvement, and ICD-10 diagnoses, several variables were significantly associated with restraint: immigrant background, low CGAS score, number of admissions, length of stay, and involuntary referral.\nRestrained and nonrestrained patients differed significantly in social, mental health, and treatment characteristics.

The aim of this study was to determine whether phthalate metabolites in urine are associated with poor neuropsychological performance in children with ADHD, and whether such association is affected by genotype-phthalate interaction. A cross-sectional examination of urine phthalate metabolite concentrations and the continuous performance test (CPT) were performed in 179 Korean children with ADHD recruited from department of psychiatry of university hospital. Correlations between urine phthalate metabolite concentrations and the CPT scores were investigated, and the interaction of phthalate metabolite levels with the selected polymorphisms at major candidate genes for ADHD, namely dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4), dopamine transporter, \u03b1-2A-adrenergic receptor, and norepinephrine transporter genes. For the subjects with the DRD4 4/4 genotype, there were significant associations of the urine phthalate metabolite concentrations with the number of omission errors, the number of commission errors, and the response time variability scores on the CPT. However, for the subjects without the DRD4 4/4 genotype, no significant associations were found. The results of this study suggest a possible association between phthalate metabolite concentrations and poor attentional performances of ADHD as well as a genetic influence on this association.

This observational study describes clinical outcomes of referring patients receiving methadone maintenance with at least one co-occurring psychiatric disorder to a community psychiatry program located on the same hospital campus.\nParticipants (n = 156) were offered priority referrals to a community psychiatry program that included regularly scheduled psychiatrist appointments, individual and group therapy, and enhanced access to psychiatric medications for 1 year. Psychiatric distress was measured with the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R), which participants completed monthly.\nWhile about 80% of the sample (n = 124) initiated psychiatric care, the average length of treatment was only 128.2 days (SD = 122.8), participants attended only 33% of all scheduled appointments (M = 14.9 sessions, SD = 14.1), and 84% (n = 104) did not complete a full year of care. Of those who did not complete a full year, over half (55%, n = 68) left psychiatric care while still receiving substance abuse treatment.

Emotions and the immediate response given by the psychiatrist were coded with the Verona Coding Definitions of Emotional Sequences. For each disclosed emotion, the potential link to preceding expressions with affective content (cue or concern) was checked and the immediate response given by the psychiatrist was coded.\nMost emotions were expressions of anxiety in terms of psycho-physiological or cognitive correlates. Concerns were present in 94% of the consultations, 47.6% were not linked to previous cues/concerns. Cues which became concerns and concerns which were further elaborated by the patient were those that had been acknowledged and handled by the psychiatrist by actively providing space to their expression.

These issues include obtaining informed consent in the face of language barriers, diagnosing and treating for mental illnesses while navigating communities where such conditions are heavily stigmatized, and justifying the cessation of proving care to current patients for the sake of providing care to new patients abroad.

Our aim was to better comprehend the reasons and expectations of neurologists, neurosurgeons and psychiatrists when requesting brain MRI scans for their patients, and also to perceive the degree of confidence of these specialists in the images and respective reports. Sixty-three specialists were recruited from two tertiary hospitals and answered a tailored questionnaire. Neurosurgeons were more concerned with the images themselves; neurologists lacked confidence in both MRI images and reports, and one third of the psychiatrists only read the report and were the most confident of the specialties in MRI findings.

Multimodal strategies have been developed to treat this disorder, some of them including medication. To this day in France, prescriptions are mainly based on methylphenidate. Ever since this drug was marketed in France in 1995, it has been subject to enhanced monitoring, mainly because of the risk of dependence, abuse, and misuse. The present study aims at assessing (1) whether the recommendations on methylphenidate use for children are being respected, (2) the extent of problematic use of methylphenidate, and (3) the impact of said recommendations being respected on the development of problematic consumption. We studied patients who were treated with methylphenidate in an academic child psychiatry department. We specifically developed a semistructured interview grid for this study. Both parents and children were interviewed. In almost three out of four cases, at least one recommendation had not been followed (52% of patients did not follow the recommendation of stopping use during weekends and holidays). We found an average of 1.6 (range, 0-5) recommendations that were not respected. In almost two out of three cases, the consumption of methylphenidate was problematic; for 40% of children, this meant the search for at least one effect other than the expected therapeutic effects, such as an intellectual, creative, or athletic boosting effect. Approximately one-third of parents also sought an effect other than therapeutic for their child. Conversely, if all of the prescription recommendations were followed, less problematic consumption was observed. Methylphenidate-based treatments must therefore be implemented after a specialist has evaluated the patient and be prescribed following the recommendations. In this context, the treatment's benefits are undeniable."}, {"Title": "Dimensional psychiatry: reward dysfunction and depressive mood across psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "A dimensional approach in psychiatry aims to identify core mechanisms of mental disorders across nosological boundaries.\nWe compared anticipation of reward between major psychiatric disorders, and investigated whether reward anticipation is impaired in several mental disorders and whether there is a common psychopathological correlate (negative mood) of such an impairment.\nWe used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a monetary incentive delay (MID) task to study the functional correlates of reward anticipation across major psychiatric disorders in 184 subjects, with the diagnoses of alcohol dependence (n\u2009=\u200926), schizophrenia (n\u2009=\u200944), major depressive disorder (MDD, n\u2009=\u200924), bipolar disorder (acute manic episode, n\u2009=\u200913), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, n\u2009=\u200923), and healthy controls (n\u2009=\u200954). Subjects' individual Beck Depression Inventory-and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-scores were correlated with clusters showing significant activation during reward anticipation.\nDuring reward anticipation, we observed significant group differences in ventral striatal (VS) activation: patients with schizophrenia, alcohol dependence, and major depression showed significantly less ventral striatal activation compared to healthy controls. Depressive symptoms correlated with dysfunction in reward anticipation regardless of diagnostic entity. There was no significant correlation between anxiety symptoms and VS functional activation.\nOur findings demonstrate a neurobiological dysfunction related to reward prediction that transcended disorder categories and was related to measures of depressed mood. The findings underline the potential of a dimensional approach in psychiatry and strengthen the hypothesis that neurobiological research in psychiatric disorders can be targeted at core mechanisms that are likely to be implicated in a range of clinical entities."}, {"Title": "The psychiatric report as moral tool: a case study in a French district court.", "Abstract": "Mental health evaluation within a legal setting is widely seen as a power to judge. The aim of this paper is to challenge this current thesis, which was popularised by Michel Foucault, who encapsulated the notion in a brief sentence: \"The sordid business of punishing is thus converted into the fine profession of curing\" (Foucault, 2003: 23). On the basis of an ethnography of a French district court (between September 2008 and May 2009, n\u00a0=\u00a060 trials) including interviews with judges (n\u00a0=\u00a010) and psychiatrists (n\u00a0=\u00a010), we study the everyday penal treatment of sexual offenders using psychiatric reports. Our findings show how (i.) the expectations of the judges select the psychiatrists' skills (based on the following criteria for their reports: accessibility of knowledge, singularization and individualization of content) and (ii.) reframe the psychiatric report as a moral tool. The clinical reasoning of forensic psychiatrists in their reports offer moral affordances due to their clinical caution regarding the risk of recidivism (therapeutic and criminological reversal, moral prevention). Both the judges' evaluation and the psychiatrists' clinical authority are shaped by a moral economy of dangerousness, which eclipses the idea of lack of criminal responsibility. In conclusion, we show that these unintended effects are necessarily of interest to most clinical practitioners engaged in work as expert witnesses."}, {"Title": "A prospective study of behavioral and emotional symptoms in preschoolers.", "Abstract": "A substantial number of preschool children exhibit psychological symptoms that have an impact on their own and their families' lives.

Therefore, there are a lot of preclinical as well as clinical proofs and hints that the LDAEP may serve as a valid indicator of synaptically released serotonin, although there are also data not supporting this relationship. This is further examplified by LDAEP data in patients with different states of schizophrenia, from prodromal to the chronic state.

The tendency to reify these disorders and to view them as independent entities, and to stretch the concept of co-morbidity to cover individuals who satisfy more than one of the diagnostic checklists is seen as being misleading as it gives a false air of precision.\nTwo broadly similar solutions are proposed for an alternative approach to common mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Establishing a nurse-based psychiatric CL service in the accident and emergency department of a general hospital in Germany.", "Abstract": "Patients with mental health problems in accident and emergency departments (A&E) are frequent users and often difficult to handle.

The aim of this study was to determine whether such a liaison service can be established in the A&E of a German general hospital. We describe structural and procedural elements of this service and present data of A&E patients who were referred to the newly established service during the first year of its existence, as well as an evaluation of this nurse-led service by non-psychiatric staff in the A&E and psychiatrists of the hospital's department of psychiatry.\nIn 2008 a nurse-based psychiatric CL-service was introduced to the A&E of the K\u00f6nigin Elisabeth Herzberge (KEH) general hospital in the city of Berlin. Pathways for the nurse's tasks were developed and patient-data collected from May 2008 till May 2009. An evaluation by questionnaire of attitudes towards the service of A&E staff and psychiatrists of the hospital's psychiatric department was performed at the end of this period.\nAlthough limited by German law that many clinical decisions to be performed by physicians only, psychiatric CL-nurses can work successfully in an A&E if prepared by special training and supervised by a CL-psychiatrist. The evaluation of the service showed benefits with respect to satisfaction and skills of staff with regard to the management of psychiatrically ill patients.\nNurse-based psychiatric CL-services in A&E departments of general hospitals, originally developed in English-speaking countries, can be adapted for and implemented in a European country like Germany.

The application of deep brain stimulation in the treatment of certain psychiatric disorders has been intensively investigated taking into account the current knowledge of neurobiological basis of mood regulation, cognition, and behaviour. This paper has been aimed at presenting the available data on experience in the application of deep brain stimulation in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. It gives an overview of scientific and professional literature, bearing in mind all the contemporary approaches in the treatment of certain psychiatric disorders. Research results available so far in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, addiction and Alzheimer's dementia, are affirmative concerning the efficacy of the method and low risk of adverse effects. Deep brain stimulation, as a relatively new neurosurgical method in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, is being intensively developed, and it is certainly going to be one of the treatments of choice, primarily of treatment-resistant disorders."}, {"Title": "Factors influencing clinicians' attitudes about aggression in Australian acute old age psychiatry inpatient units: a cross sectional survey design.", "Abstract": "Patient aggression occurs in old age psychiatry and is problematic.

Eighty-five individuals, comprising nurses (n = 75) and medical and allied health staff (n = 10), completed the questionnaire. The results show that gender, profession, and work experience do not affect attitudes toward aggression. A low score indicated agreement with an attitudinal statement. However, younger age, better higher level of completed education, and place of work increased the likelihood of participants endorsing the questionnaire's attitudinal statements about aggression.

Findings indicate that facilitators to MedMAP implementation included practitioner recognition of the value of MedMAP, consumer involvement, collaboration, continuity of care, and fidelity assessments. Barriers to MedMAP implementation included problematic technology, work flow issues, lack of flexibility in prescribers' ability to implement MedMAP guidelines, regulatory and financial barriers, and consumer insurance status. Recommendations for improving future implementation efforts of MedMAP emphasize technological readiness, development of innovative models of care delivery, an emphasis on treatment guided by outcomes, and active leadership to promote EBPs within organizations and academic settings."}, {"Title": "Placebo for depression: we need to improve the quality of scientific information but also reject too simplistic approaches or ideological nihilism.", "Abstract": "The placebo response plays a major role in psychiatry, particularly in depression.

Anthropological and psychiatric challenges, it is argued, are crystallised in the voice, a medium that signifies the intersection of models of occult madness and schizophrenia. The psychiatry and religious healing practised at a Sufi shrine in Gujarat differed in terms of the status accorded to the voice: psychiatry interpreted the voice as a symptom of mental disorder, whereas religious healing used the medium in ambiguous practices of possession trance, combining performances of madness and healing. Although 'doing trance' is considered an essential part in the process of healing, patients diagnosed with schizophrenia do not experience trance. Their patiency is displaced onto a caretaker. Psychiatric theories resting on the somatised mind partly converge with theories of madness based on sorcery and possession in so far as both posit a direct link between the brain and behaviour. Against the background of the contested religious healing sites that are currently debated in Indian public mental health, attention to multiple dimensions of the voice reveals its significance as an alternative to the psychiatric institutionalisation of people coping with mental disorder. The voice reconciles the dichotomy between scientific psychiatry and traditional ritual healing, partly by making sense of madness by engaging with the sense of hearing."}, {"Title": "Indigenous ethnopsychiatry in the north-west of England: the case of 'Barrow Man'.", "Abstract": "This paper describes the appearance and subsequent disappearance of 'Barrow Man' and uses anthropological and social psychological theory to examine the socio-cultural, psychological and economic conditions for the existence of the phenomenon.

We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses of variables correlating with uptake of antiviral therapy and frequency of treatment-related side-effects.\nOf 773 referred patients, 235 (30%) described pre-existing psychiatric illness. Among these, 26% received antiviral therapy, compared with 30% of 538 without psychiatric comorbidity. History of depression (usually validated by liaison psychiatry) was associated with higher incidence of treatment-related neuropsychiatric side-effects (odds ratio 2.79 [1.35-5.70], P < 0.05) but did not affect treatment outcome. Twenty-seven patients reported schizophrenia: three (11%) received antiviral therapy, compared with 30% admitting depression and 20% with bipolar affective disorder (all assessed by psychiatrist). In most schizophrenia cases, the reason for not offering antiviral treatment was psychological illness, yet none of five treated (these three plus two others in a psychiatric rehabilitation facility) experienced worsening psychiatric symptoms.\nA history of depression is common with hepatitis C but does not affect initiation of antiviral treatment, despite substantially increased risk of psychiatric side-effects. In contrast, pre-existing schizophrenia appears to influence treatment decisions, despite little evidence that PEG-IFN/RBV exacerbates the psychiatric condition, and well-supervised antiviral therapy can have good outcomes."}, {"Title": "Predictors of length of hospital stay for patients with late-onset depression in Japan.", "Abstract": "The length of hospital stay (LOHS) for elderly patients tends to be long.

High intelligence indicates overall good brain functioning and might thus present a particularly good opportunity to study possible cerebral correlates of core autistic features in terms of impaired social cognition, communication skills, the need for routines, and circumscribed interests. Anatomical MRI data sets for 30 highly intelligent patients with high-functioning autism and 30 pairwise-matched control subjects were acquired and analyzed with voxel-based morphometry. The gray matter volume of the pairwise-matched patients and the controls did not differ significantly. When correcting for total brain volume influences, the patients with ASD exhibited smaller left superior frontal volumes on a trend level. Heterogeneous volumetric findings in earlier studies might partly be explained by study samples biased by a high inclusion rate of secondary forms of ASD, which often go along with neuronal abnormalities.

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u05f3s Disease (AD), have high prevalence in the elderly population. Early diagnosis of this type of disease allows early treatment and improves patient quality of life. This paper proposes a Bayesian network decision model for supporting diagnosis of dementia, AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Bayesian networks are well-suited for representing uncertainty and causality, which are both present in clinical domains. The proposed Bayesian network was modeled using a combination of expert knowledge and data-oriented modeling. The network structure was built based on current diagnostic criteria and input from physicians who are experts in this domain. The network parameters were estimated using a supervised learning algorithm from a dataset of real clinical cases. The dataset contains data from patients and normal controls from the Duke University Medical Center (Washington, USA) and the Center for Alzheimer\u05f3s Disease and Related Disorders (at the Institute of Psychiatry of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). The dataset attributes consist of predisposal factors, neuropsychological test results, patient demographic data, symptoms and signs. The decision model was evaluated using quantitative methods and a sensitivity analysis. In conclusion, the proposed Bayesian network showed better results for diagnosis of dementia, AD and MCI when compared to most of the other well-known classifiers. Moreover, it provides additional useful information to physicians, such as the contribution of certain factors to diagnosis."}, {"Title": "Is attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder a risk factor for sustaining fractures of proximal humerus?", "Abstract": "To evaluate whether or not children with displaced proximal humerus fractures are more likely to have attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nBetween January 2010 and February 2013, we retrospectively evaluated 42 children with proximal humerus fractures.

The development, testing, optimization, and validation of new biosensors has become a highly interdisciplinary effort involving experts in chemistry, biology, physics, engineering, and medicine. The sensitivity, the specificity and the reproducibility of biosensors have improved tremendously as a result of incorporating nanomaterials in their design. In general, nanomaterials-based electrochemical immunosensors amplify the sensitivity by facilitating greater loading of the larger sensing surface with biorecognition molecules as well as improving the electrochemical properties of the transducer. The most common types of nanomaterials and their properties will be described. In addition, the utilization of nanomaterials in immunosensors for biomarker detection will be discussed since these biosensors have enormous potential for a myriad of clinical uses.

Resident physicians completed a data collection form for each participant using information from the patient interview and from the prescription monitoring program report. Prescription drug misuse was defined as having any 1 of the following 5 criteria in the prescription monitoring program report: (1) filled prescriptions for 2 or more controlled substances, (2) obtained prescriptions from 2 or more providers, (3) obtained early refills, (4) used 3 or more pharmacies, and (5) the prescription monitoring program report conflicted with the patient's report.\nAt least 1 indicator of prescription drug misuse was found in 41.7% of patients. Over 69% of the patients that the residents believed were misusing prescription drugs actually met 1 of the criteria for prescription drug misuse. The prescription monitoring program report changed the management only 2.2% of the time. Patients with prior benzodiazepine use (\u03c7(2) 1 = 17.68, P < .001), prior opioid use (\u03c7(2) 1 = 19.98, P < .001), a personality disorder (\u03c7(2) 1 = 7.22, P < .001), and chronic pain (\u03c7(2) 1 = 14.31, P < .001) had a higher percentage of prescription drug misuse compared to patients without these factors.\nUsing the prescription monitoring program to screen patients with prior benzodiazepine and opioid use, with a personality disorder, and/or with chronic pain may be useful in confirming the suspicion of prescription drug misuse identified at the initial evaluation."}, {"Title": "Informed consent and ECT: how much information should be provided?", "Abstract": "Obtaining informed consent before providing treatment is a routine part of modern clinical practice. For some treatments, however, there may be disagreement over the requirements for 'informed' consent. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one such example. Blease argues that patients 'should surely be privy to the matters of fact that: (1) there is continued controversy over the effectiveness of ECT; (2) there is orthodox scientific consensus that there is currently no acknowledged explanation for ECT and (3) there is a serious (mainstream) debate over whether the response to ECT may be a placebo response.' Before embracing these suggestions, two key questions must be asked. Are these claims a reasonable representation of current ECT research? And if so, will this information be of benefit to patients? The evidence-based support for ECT from both National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Royal College of Psychiatrists appears to undermine the validity of claims (1) and (3), and therefore the rationale for providing this information. Concerning assertion (2), it is true that the mechanism by which ECT has its therapeutic effect is not yet established, although the importance of conveying this fact to the patient is questionable. Of greater certainty is that the same irresolution surrounds the mechanism of action of pharmaceutical antidepressants, and so a double standard in patient care should be mindfully avoided if provision of this information is deemed a prerequisite for proper 'informed' consent."}, {"Title": "[Somatic manifestations among depressed children: the case of complains and conversion symptoms].", "Abstract": "If all authors agree on the presence of fundamental changes in mood, as the basis of the diagnosis of depression, little importance is accorded to other symptoms that can mislead the diagnosis: in particular, age and cultural influence on depressive symptoms.\nOur work aims to describe and assess the frequency of somatic complaints and symptoms of conversion in Tunisian children and adolescents followed for depressive disorders, and to compare, through a study of literature to populations from different cultures.\nThis work consisted in a retrospective review of children who consulted the Department of Child Psychiatry between 2008 and 2011 and in whom the diagnosis of depressive disorders was retained according to DSM IV criteria. Were searched all the conversion symptoms corresponding to the DSM IV diagnoses of conversion and dissociative disorders, as well as all the somatic complaints reported. Children with organic were excluded in order not to confuse the pain secondary to these disorders from those associated with depression. Also, children with mental retardation, moderate, severe or profound were not included because their difficulties of expression can alter the semiological assessment.\n119 children and adolescents aged 6 to19 years were included in the study. The mean age of the population was 11.6 years. Somatic complains were present in 37% of cases. Headaches were mostly represented (27.7%), followed by abdominal pain (14.3%). The presence of somatic complaints was significantly correlated with the presence of a comorbid anxiety (p=0.035). Conversion symptoms were present in 22.7% of cases.

This cross-sectional quantitative study used a non-probability, purposive sampling technique to recruit 212 Taiwanese diagnosed with schizophrenia from Taiwanese Alliance of the Mentally Ill, 4 community mental health rehabilitation centres and 2 psychiatric hospitals between July 2012 and March 2013. Linear regression models were used for analysis. The results showed that environmental attributions were positively associated with both perceived working alliance and perceived informational support, while supernatural attributions were negatively associated with perceived working alliance and perceived informational support. Perceived stigma had a negative association with perceived working alliance. The discrimination domain of internalized stigma specifically had a positive association with perceived working alliance, while the withdraw domain had a negative association with perceived informational support.

Efforts to treat patients with depression, anxiety, and chemical dependency are surpassed by the great demand for psychiatrist and therapist appointments. Unlike other specialties, psychiatry lacks a vital sign or tests (eg, blood pressure for hypertension and hemoglobin A1c for diabetes) to objectively measure a patient's response to therapy. A new tool called the Treatment Progress Indicator (TPI) appears to offer clinicians an objective approach to assess patients and to monitor therapy over time. The TPI report shows an Expected Treatment Response that allows clinicians to compare their patients' responses to therapy with those of a cohort of patients with a similar diagnosis and severity. The TPI allows for objective population-level management of disease. This should result in sharing of best practices that will lead to more effective and efficient care plans. Widespread implementation of the TPI has the potential to improve the time required to diagnose conditions and triage patients. As a result, implementation of the tool has the potential to improve behavioral health access and affordability."}, {"Title": "[Idiopathic bilateral basal ganglia calcification (Fahr's disease) presenting with psychotic depression and criminal violence: a case report with forensic aspect].", "Abstract": "Fahr's disease is a rare neuropsychiatric disease characterized by bilateral intracranial calcification, primarily in the basal ganglia. The more general term, Fahr's syndrome, is used for primary and secondary basal ganglia calcification, regardless of the etiology, but the term Fahr's disease is used to describe primary, idiopathic cases. Fahr's disease may present with neurological symptoms, such as parkinsonism and extrapyramidal symptoms, dysarthria, paresis, convulsion, and syncope. Psychiatric disorders, including behavioral disorders, psychosis, and mood disorders, as well as cognitive disorders can occur. CT is useful for the diagnosis of Fahr's disease. Herein we present a patient diagnosed as Fahr's disease that presented with symptoms of depression, delusions, and auditory hallucinations. The 47-year-old male patient was hospitalized in a forensic psychiatry inpatient clinic due to aggressive behavior and was subsequently diagnosed with major depressive disorder with psychotic features. While hospitalized he was treated with antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs, as well as electroconvulsive therapy, resulting in significant improvement in his symptoms. As bilateral basal ganglia calcification was observed via CT, the patient was diagnosed as Fahr's disease. This case report emphasizes the importance of cranial imaging and detailed laboratory examination when evaluating patients with psychosis and affective symptoms.

The case is also rare because of the unique circumstances involving the victim - a local service psychiatrist - and the perpetrator - a former medical specialist in psychiatry, suffering from a delusional psychotic disorder. The crossbow was the decisive instrument in the realization of the murder; it was chosen with premeditation for its high destructive capacity and the fact that it was easily obtainable, and it was used with darts that were specially modified to increase its harmful capacity. The presented case, as well as providing an opportunity to highlight the damaging effects of a rarely used weapon, stresses the problems inherent with access to tools such as the crossbow that are used in sport, and which are potentially dangerous but easily accessible, even to those with serious mental disorders, rendering them legally unfit for using firearms."}, {"Title": "Development of forensic mental health services in Japan: working towards the reintegration of offenders with mental disorders.", "Abstract": "Until the recent enactment of the Medical Treatment and Supervision Act (MTSA) in 2005, neither legislations nor facilities for mentally disordered offenders were available in Japan. The aim of the country's forensic mental health services, based on this new law, is to improve the social reintegration of mentally disordered offenders. In order to provide optimal psychiatric care to these individuals, specialised court proceedings, treatment facilities, and concrete guidelines have been established. The aim of this study was to review the current status of the new system and to clarify future challenges for improving services.\nThe authors collected official statistics regarding the new system published separately by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the Ministry of Justice, and the Supreme Court of Japan. We aggregated the data and examined the system's current implementation status, nationwide.\nThere were 2,750 requests for enrolment in the MTSA system between its initiation in 2005 and 31 December 2012. Of those requests, 2,724 cases had been concluded in court. In 63.1% of the cases, an inpatient treatment order had been made; 82.4% of those inpatients were diagnosed with schizophrenia. By the end of March 2012, two patients completing treatment under the MTSA had re-committed a serious offense. While overall designated inpatient and outpatient treatment facilities have reached national targets in terms of resources and beds available, a regional gap in MTSA designated facilities remains and the number of patients under inpatient treatment order is on the increase.\nOverall, the MTSA system has been running smoothly without encountering any serious problems. However, several concerns have emerged, such as the accumulation of patients under inpatient treatment order and insufficient regional resources. To more successfully promote the reintegration of mentally disordered offenders, improvements in outpatient treatment and welfare services are crucial.

The associated autoantibodies are directed against the extracellular domains of cell-surface-expressed neuronal or glial proteins such as LGI1, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, and aquaporin-4. The original descriptions of the associated clinical syndromes were phenotypically well circumscribed. However, as availability of antibody testing has increased, the range of associated patient phenotypes and demographics has expanded. This in turn has led to the recognition of more immunotherapy-responsive syndromes in patients presenting with cognitive and behavioral problems, seizures, movement disorders, psychiatric features, and demyelinating disease. Although antibody detection remains diagnostically important, clinical recognition of these distinctive syndromes should ensure early and appropriate immunotherapy administration. We review the emerging paradigm of cell-surface-directed antibody-mediated neurological diseases, describe how the associated disease spectrums have broadened since the original descriptions, discuss some of the methodological issues regarding techniques for antibody detection and emphasize considerations surrounding immunotherapy administration. As these disorders continue to reach mainstream neurology and even psychiatry, more cell-surface-directed antibodies will be discovered, and their possible relevance to other more common disease presentations should become more clearly defined."}, {"Title": "Mistrust of numbers: the difficult development of psychiatric epidemiology in France, 1940-80.", "Abstract": "This article uses archival as well as published materials to trace the development of psychiatric epidemiology in France from 1945 to 1980.

However, there has been a steep decline in the development of new medication classes. Instead of new molecular entities, slight molecular modifications producing \"me-too\" drugs attempted to garner market share. With failing profitability, industry is now withdrawing from psychiatric medication development. Managed care drastically shortened contact between patients and clinicians, so the possible observation of unexpected benefits has been nullified. The randomized, parallel-groups design met FDA requirements for specific pharmacological efficacy. However, it does not determine whether a patient who improved while drug-treated required the drug or would have gotten better on his own. Further, pathophysiology benefit remains obscure. The major psychotropic drugs have no benefits for normal subjects. Their remarkable benefits must stem from a necessary interaction with a pathophysiological state. Therefore, understanding therapeutic benefit by treating normal subjects becomes unlikely. The claim that therapeutic knowledge in psychiatry proceeds from bench to bedside has proven vacuous, primarily because of our limited understanding of brain pathophysiology.

As caloric vestibular stimulation has been demonstrated to modulate a variety of cognitive functions associated with brain activations, especially in the temporal-parietal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and insular cortex, there is evidence to assume an effect in specific mental disorders. Therefore, we go on to hypothesize that lateralized cold vestibular caloric stimulation will be effective in treating conversion disorder and we present provisional evidence from one patient that supports this conclusion.

Our investigation showed that her symptoms were caused by pseudobulbar affect/emotional incontinence stemming from multiple sclerosis.\nThe patient's history of multiple sclerosis and the fact that she identified herself as depressed only because of her incessant crying suggested that her symptoms might be due to the multiple sclerosis rather than to a depressive disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a new plaque consistent with multiple sclerosis lateral to her corpus callosum. Her symptoms resolved completely within three days on valproic acid but returned after she was cross-tapered to dextromethorphan plus quinidine, which is the FDA-approved treatment for this condition.\nThis case provides important additional information to the current literature on pseudobulbar affect/emotional incontinence. The existing literature suggests a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and dextromethorphan/quinidine (Nuedexta) as first-line treatments; however, our patient was taking an SSRI at the time of presentation without appreciable benefit, and her symptoms responded to valproic acid but not to the dextromethorphan/quinidine. In addition, the case and the literature review suggest that the current nomenclature for this constellation of symptoms can be misleading."}, {"Title": "Effects of contralateral noise on the 20-Hz auditory steady state response--magnetoencephalography study.", "Abstract": "The auditory steady state response (ASSR) is an oscillatory brain response, which is phase locked to the rhythm of an auditory stimulus. ASSRs have been recorded in response to a wide frequency range of modulation and/or repetition, but the physiological features of the ASSRs are somewhat different depending on the modulation frequency. Recently, the 20-Hz ASSR has been emphasized in clinical examinations, especially in the area of psychiatry. However, little is known about the physiological properties of the 20-Hz ASSR, compared to those of the 40-Hz and 80-Hz ASSRs. The effects of contralateral noise on the ASSR are known to depend on the modulation frequency to evoke ASSR. However, the effects of contralateral noise on the 20-Hz ASSR are not known. Here we assessed the effects of contralateral white noise at a level of 70 dB SPL on the 20-Hz and 40-Hz ASSRs using a helmet-shaped magnetoencephalography system in 9 healthy volunteers (8 males and 1 female, mean age 31.2 years). The ASSRs were elicited by monaural 1000-Hz 5-s tone bursts amplitude-modulated at 20 and 39 Hz and presented at 80 dB SPL. Contralateral noise caused significant suppression of both the 20-Hz and 40-Hz ASSRs, although suppression was significantly smaller for the 20-Hz ASSRs than the 40-Hz ASSRs. Moreover, the greatest suppression of both 20-Hz and 40-Hz ASSRs occurred in the right hemisphere when stimuli were presented to the right ear with contralateral noise. The present study newly showed that 20-Hz ASSRs are suppressed by contralateral noise, which may be important both for characterization of the 20-Hz ASSR and for interpretation in clinical situations. Physicians must be aware that the 20-Hz ASSR is significantly suppressed by sound (e.g. masking noise or binaural stimulation) applied to the contralateral ear."}, {"Title": "The Breivik controversy: politics, terrorism and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "To examine and analyse the controversy over psychiatric aspects of the case of Norwegian far right mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik.\nBecause of a basic acceptance of methodological individualism and scientific positivism, mainstream psychiatry is currently ill suited to being broadly applied to the spheres of politics and political violence.

The diagnosis of GTS is clinical and, in most cases, straightforward. Tics as a hallmark of GTS are usually easy to recognize and distinguish from other movement disorders as fragmented, repetitive, exaggerated movements resembling normal motor behavior, but appearing out of context. In complex cases, knowledge on additional characteristics and signs as, for example, tic distribution, suggestibility, voluntary tic inhibition, and presence of echo- or paliphenomena might further aid clinical diagnosis. However, although defining GTS, tics are rarely the main issue. The presence of comorbidities and coexisting psychopathologies often hampers normal development and negatively affects quality of life. Their recognition and treatment is paramount. Here, we review existing literature and provide a comprehensive update on the multifarious aspects of the movement disorder and neuropsychiatry of GTS. We also provide a list of associated movement disorders known to occur in GTS patients and discuss differential diagnoses to be considered in atypical cases.

Task-independent functional brain imaging is a relatively novel technique that allows examination of the brain's intrinsic networks, defined as functionally and (often) structurally connected populations of neurons whose properties reflect fundamental neurobiological organizational principles of the central nervous system. The ability to study the activity and organization of these networks has opened a promising new avenue for translational investigation, because they can be analogously examined across species and disease states. Interestingly, imaging studies have revealed shared spatial and functional characteristics of the intrinsic network architecture of the brain across species, including mice, rats, non-human primates, and humans.

Often initiated by early traumatic events, \"engrams\" or memories are formed that may give rise to a slow and subtle progression of psychiatric disorders. The large delay between beginning and time of onset (diagnosis) may be explained by efficient compensatory mechanisms observed in brain metabolism that use optional pathways in highly redundant molecular interactions. To this end, research has to deal with mechanisms of learning and long-term memory formation, which involves (a) epigenetic changes, (b) altered neuronal activities, and (c) changes in neuron-glia communication. On the epigenetic level, apparently DNA-methylations are more stable than histone modifications, although both closely interact. Neuronal activities basically deliver digital information, which clearly can serve as basis for memory formation (LTP). However, research in this respect has long time neglected the importance of glia. They are more actively involved in the control of neuronal activities than thought before. They can both reinforce and inhibit neuronal activities by transducing neuronal information from frequency-encoded to amplitude and frequency-modulated calcium wave patterns spreading in the glial syncytium by use of gap junctions. In this way, they serve integrative functions. In conclusion, we are dealing with two concepts of encoding information that mutually control each other and synergize: a digital (neuronal) and a wave-like (glial) computing, forming neuron-glia functional units with inbuilt feedback loops to maintain balance of excitation and inhibition. To better understand mental illness, we have to gain more insight into the dynamics of adverse environmental impact on those cellular and molecular systems.

Factor analysis was used to identify key attitudes and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare the groups adjusting for age and personal experience with people with mental illness.\nThere were no significant trends in attitudes towards the effectiveness of medication. Exploratory factor analysis of the beliefs and attitudes items identified four factors: (1) comfort socializing with people with mental, illness; (2) non-superstitious beliefs about the causes of mental illness; (3) neighborly feelings towards people with mental illness; and (4) belief that stress and abuse are part of the etiology of mental illness. ANCOVA comparing attitudes among the three groups showed that on three (1, 2, and 4) of the four factors medical students who had completed a rotation in psychiatry had significantly higher scores than the medical students who had not completed a rotation in psychiatry. Graduate physicians showed a similar pattern scoring higher than the medical students who had not completed a rotation in psychiatry in two factors (1 and 4) but showed no differences from students who had completed their psychiatry rotation.\nWhile beliefs about medication effectiveness do not differ between medical trainees and graduate professionals, stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental illness seem to be most strongly affected by clinical training.

In order to deepen our understanding of the roots of collective (social) trauma and the specific traumatic experiences of different groups, and to offer different perspectives and information on how trauma can be dealt with, the \"Trauma Trust Memory\" multinational interdisciplinary research network is being established, and a groundbreaking workshop was held in May 2013 in Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina.\nThe Tuzla Workshop showed that the active participation of affected groups in adequate coping with the past is required for post-conflict reconstruction, trauma healing and peacebuilding in the long run."}, {"Title": "Teaching science throughout the six-year medical curriculum: two-year experience from the University of Split School of Medicine, Split, Croatia.", "Abstract": "The aim of this article is to present the introduction of a mandatory, vertically integrated course in research methodology into medical curriculum. At the School of Medicine in Split (Croatia) we organized this course in 2010, with the total of 270 hours in the 6-year curriculum. In the first year (50 hours) students learned basic principles of scientific method, structure of scientific article, basic statistical concepts, data analysis, interpretation and presentation. In the second year (25 hours) students applied the knowledge from the first year in real examples of research data to answer a research hypothesis and present the results and conclusions. Students were guided through the process of making a hypothesis, analyzing data, interpreting them, constructing tables and figures, and writing a short research report. At the end of the course they formally presented the results to other students and course teachers, using PowerPoint slides. The third year (25 hours) was devoted to mastering concepts and basic skills of evidencebased medicine (EBM). The course in the fourth year (25 hours) was integrated with the clinical courses (internal medicine, neurology, and psychiatry) and structured as a \"journal club\". In the fifth year (25 hours), the teaching was devoted to developing a research plan for the graduation thesis that the students had to conduct during the sixth year. The sixth year (120 hours) was devoted to the execution of research planned in the fifth year, including data collection, data analysis, interpretation, and thesis writing and defense.\nThe new course succeeded in increasing students' knowledge and skills for critical thinking and EBM, and prepared them for life-long learning in medicine."}, {"Title": "Restless legs syndrome/Willis Ekbom disease: evaluation and treatment.", "Abstract": "Restless legs syndrome/Willis Ekbom disease (RLS/WED) has been recognized as a significant medical disorder since the 17th century. It was studied mostly in the last 50 years in relation to increasing interest in sleep medicine and health-related quality of life. This led to recognition that the disease is not well characterized as restless feelings in the legs. These symptoms are reported in many situations, but the subjective experience of RLS/WED patients differs from that experienced by others. Thus a new name has been introduced that avoids problems of symptom definition of a disease by naming it after those who first characterized it, i.e. 'Willis Ekbom disease'. This article emphasizes the importance of RLS/WED for psychiatry. The disease carries significant increased risk for depression and anxiety disorders. Treatment requires consideration of these co-morbid disorders. RLS/WED can exacerbate or even engender psychiatric disease, so treatment of psychiatric disease should also include consideration of RLS/WED. The need for attention to RLS/WED is particularly significant for depression. Most anti-depressants exacerbate or can even engender RLS/WED. Thus this article seeks to introduce RLS/WED in relation to psychiatric practice. It presents the RLS/WED disease, its overlap with psychiatry and the current treatment options."}, {"Title": "From theory to practice: making entrustable professional activities come to life in the context of milestones.", "Abstract": "Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) are gaining traction across the globe as a practical way to teach and assess competencies in the clinical setting. Full-scale implementation, though, has only taken place in obstetrics-gynecology in the Netherlands and in psychiatry in Australia and New Zealand. As with any conceptual framework, implementation in different contexts will require adaptations. For example, implementation in the United States will need to incorporate the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's competencies and the recently completed milestones for each of the specialties. In this issue, an article by Aylward and colleagues describes the process for implementing a handoff communication EPA, using milestones as the basis for the assessment tool. The explicit linkage of the milestones with the EPA assessment allows a more definitive \"picture\" of the learner to emerge at each advancing level of performance of the EPA. This \"picture\" can be shared with those directly observing the learner and thus provides a potential model for a more reliable assessment of learners performing EPAs and perhaps a more consistent approach to entrustment decisions. The authors hope that Aylward and colleagues' article will be one of many that aim to help the medical education community understand how to implement EPAs as a framework for competency demonstration, as educators try to determine what works, under what conditions and in what settings. Only through a committed effort to share lessons learned can the promise of the theory be translated to practice in the field."}, {"Title": "Medicine and Mind-Body Dualism: A Reply to Mehta's Critique.", "Abstract": "Neeta Mehta recently advanced the thesis that medical practice is facing a crisis today. In her paper \"Mind-body dualism: a critique from a health perspective\" she attributes the crisis to the philosophy of Descartes and set out to understand why this dualism is still alive despite its disavowal from philosophers, health practitioners and lay people. The aim of my reply to her critique is three-fold. First, I draw attention to a more fundamental problem and show that dualism is inescapable-scientifically and commonsensically. I then focus on the self-conscious emotions of shame, guilt and remorse, and argue that the self is not identical with a brain. The third section draws attention to the crisis in psychiatry and stipulates some of the main reasons why this is so. Contrary to Mehta's thesis, the health profession faces a crisis because of physicalism and biological reductionism."}, {"Title": "Shrug ambivalence and disagreement; search commonalities in psychiatric phenomena(**).", "Abstract": "Holistic understanding is necessary to study intimate nuances of psychological/psychopathological processes; also, individual manifestations and individual approach are laudable goals in treatment and approach. But we cannot forget that major therapeutic advances result when we are able to delineate commonalities and stable symptom clusters that cut across geo-cultural boundaries and are amenable to study and intervention. Even though the purpose and approach of psychiatry, as of all medicine, has to be humane and caring, major therapeutic advancements and aetiologic understandings result only from a scientific methodology that stresses and figures out the commonalities of psychopathological phenomena. It is a mistake to stress individuality so much that commonalities are obliterated. Although stress on the individual's needs has helped psychiatry at times become more humane, it has hurt the task enormously by making some very bright minds question the very scientific basis of psychiatry and its status as a medical discipline. Hence, even as it is necessary to promote holistic and individualistic caring, it is equally necessary to shrug ambivalence and crippling disagreements that can result if individualism in therapy is carried beyond limits. Psychiatry's tradition, and field, will always allow for diversity in its practice, even in its theorising. For, psychopathology has both a personal, deep inner dimension - due to biogenetic and personality factors - and social, manifest/unmanifest, outer dimension - due to the environment. And the practice, and theory, of both are likely to be different, although we do try to amalgamate them in our 'bio-psycho-social' model. Such differences are only manifestations of an intricate network of influences that make for the human condition in health and disease. Psychiatry is the one branch which realises this diversity the most, but equally important for it is to stress its unity: Of purpose - that of reducing individual and social psychopathology;Of goals - that of unravelling the aetiopathology of psychiatric disorders; finding precision in diagnostics and investigative tests; finding biomarkers; and finding precise therapies for precise disorders that control such disorders; and not just control, but finally cure them; finding methods of primary prevention; of moving from mental disorder to mental health; and, further, of progress to individual actualisation and personal and collective well-being with longevity;Of practice - a) in therapy: By synergising psychopharmacology/somatic therapies with psychotherapy/therapies, social therapies and pharmacogenetics; b) in diagnostics: By identifying the phenotype-genotype-endophenotype axis; and (c) by promoting such therapy and diagnostics as brings about control, and finally, cure/primary prevention of psychiatric disorders.The future course for psychiatry involves a goal oriented forward movement - while allowing for diversity in practice and theory, stressing on unity of purpose, goals, and practice."}, {"Title": "Welcome biological breakthroughs, supply psychosocial insights.", "Abstract": "Human behaviour, emotions, and cognition are complex to understand and explain. It is even more difficult to understand the basis for abnormal behaviour, disturbed emotions, and impaired cognitions, something mental health professionals are trying for long. In these pursuits, psychiatry has traversed through eras of humours, witchcraft, spirits, psychoanalysis, and gradually deviated from other medical specialities. Now, with recent biological breakthroughs like advances in psychopharmacology, neuroimaging and genetics, increasingly more emphasis is being given to the biological model of psychiatric disorders. These new biological models have given a more scientific appearance to the speciality. It has also revolutionised the management strategies and outcome of many psychiatric disorders. However, this rapid development in biological understanding of psychiatry also leads to a new wave of reductionism. In an attempt to deduce everything in terms of neurons, neurochemicals, and genes, can we neglect psychosocial aspects of mental health? Patients' personality, expectations, motives, family background, sociocultural backgrounds continue to affect mental health no matter how much 'biological' psychiatry gets. Biological and psychosocial approaches are not mutually exclusive but complementary. Integrating them harmoniously is the skill psychiatry demands for comprehensive understanding of mental and behavioural disorders."}, {"Title": "Speaking to a Wider Audience about the Positive Contributions of Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "We live in a world that is increasingly complex, intense, and stressful. Most people, at some time or other in their lives, can make good use of psychiatry as they map their course and steer their way through it. While this holds true, there also exists a very disturbing trend. No other branch of medicine suffers a similar, constant criticism, scrutiny and quite often downright vehement protest. Even the service users, who have been greatly benefitted, choose to stay mum for fear of stigmatization that may follow if they admit to have undergone therapy. The onus lies on both, the service users and providers alike, to take the positive contributions of psychiatry to the masses at large. All of us, especially medical professionals, need to consider our own attitudes and awareness. The recognition that anyone will break down if mental stress is high enough should help free us from a 'them and us' attitude. Reading about people's own experience of mental illness can promote understanding: Examples include a successful actress and a prize-winning author. For mental health practitioners, enabling service users to influence service development is another strong anti-stigma move. A cognitive behavior therapy approach can help individuals overcome the stigma felt and also cope better with discrimination. Also, we need to stand up against mental health discrimination wherever it is encountered."}, {"Title": "The Task before Psychiatry Today Redux: STSPIR*.", "Abstract": "This paper outlines six important tasks for psychiatry today, which can be put in short as: Spread and scale up services;Talk;Science,Psychotherapy;Integrate; andResearch excellence.

Spread and scale up services: Spreading mental health services to uncovered areas, and increasing facilities in covered areas:Mental disorders are leading cause of ill health but bottom of health agenda;Patients face widespread discrimination, human rights violations and lack of facilities;Need to stem the brain drain from developing countries;At any given point, 10% of the adult population report having some mental or behavioural disorder;In India, serious mental disorders affect nearly 80 million people, i.e. combined population of the northern top of India, including Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh;Combating imbalance between burden of demand and supply of efficient psychiatric services in all countries, especially in developing ones like India, is the first task before psychiatry today. If ever a greater role for activism were needed, this is the field;The need is to scale up effective and cost-effective treatments and preventive interventions for mental disorders.TALK: Speaking to a wider audience about positive contributions of psychiatry:Being aware of, understanding, and countering, the massive anti-psychiatry propaganda online and elsewhere;Giving a firm answer to anti-psychiatry even while understanding its transformation into mental health consumerism and opposition to reckless medicalisation;Defining normality and abnormality;Bringing about greater precision in diagnosis and care;Motivating those helped by psychiatry to speak up;Setting up informative websites and organising programmes to reduce stigma and spread mental health awareness;Setting up regular columns in psychiatry journals around the globe, called 'Patients Speak', or something similar, wherein those who have been helped get a chance to voice their stories.SCIENCE: Shrugging ambivalence and disagreement and searching for commonalities in psychiatric phenomena;An idiographic orientation which stresses individuality cannot, and should not, preclude the nomothetic or norm laying thrust that is the crux of scientific progress.The major contribution of science has been to recognize such commonalities so they can be researched, categorized and used for human welfare.It is a mistake to stress individuality so much that commonalities are obliterated.While the purpose and approach of psychiatry, as of all medicine, has to be humane and caring, therapeutic advancements and aetiologic understandings are going to result only from a scientific methodology.Just caring is not enough, if you have not mastered the methods of care, which only science can supply.PSYCHOTHERAPY: Psychiatrists continuing to do psychotherapy:Psychotherapy must be clearly defined, its parameters and methods firmly delineated, its proof of effectiveness convincingly demonstrated by evidence based and controlled trials;Psychotherapy research suffers from neglect by the mainstream at present, because of the ascendancy of biological psychiatry;It suffers resource constraints as major sponsors like pharma not interested;Needs funding from some sincere researcher organisations and altruistic sponsors, as also professional societies and governments;Psychotherapy research will have to provide enough irrefutable evidence that it works, with replicable studies that prove it across geographical areas;It will not do for psychiatrists to hand over psychotherapy to clinical psychologists and others.INTEGRATE APPROACHES: Welcoming biological breakthroughs, while supplying psychosocial insights:Experimental breakthroughs, both in aetiology and therapeutics, will come mainly from biology, but the insights and leads can hopefully come from many other fields, especially the psychosocial and philosophical;The biological and the psychological are not exclusive but complementary approaches;Both integration and reductionism are valid. Integration is necessary as an attitude, reductionism is necessary as an approach.

(2014).", "Abstract": "A group of children presents with a rather peculiar type of oppositional behaviours, sometimes now subsumed under the label of 'pathological demand avoidance' syndrome, also increasingly referred to as PDA. Boys and girls with 'this kind of PDA' will do anything to avoid meeting demands of adults and children alike. The behaviours 'used' in maintaining avoidance range from openly oppositional or manipulative to 'extreme shyness', passivity and muteness. These behaviours in terms of expression of affection are rather the opposite of those associated with the commonly used meaning of PDA. However, the avoidant behaviour is quite often 'publicly displayed' and with no feeling for the inappropriateness of the, sometimes even, exhibitionist style of extreme demand avoidance (EDA). The 'disorder' was first heard of in 1980, when Elisabeth Newson presented the first 12 cases of what she believed to be a 'new' and separate syndrome and that she referred to as PDA. Even though PDA has attracted quite a bit of clinical attention in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe (including Scandinavia), virtually no research has been published in the field so far (Newson, Le Mar\u00e9chal, & David, ). Experienced clinicians throughout child psychiatry, child neurology and paediatrics testify to its existence and the very major problems encountered when it comes to intervention and treatment. It is therefore a major step forward that O'Nions and co-workers (this issue) have developed a new 'trait measure' for PDA ('the EDA-Q'), a measure that appears to hold considerable promise for research, and eventually for clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Social neuroscience and its potential contribution to psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Most mental disorders involve disruptions of normal social behavior.

In this paper, we draw lessons for translational research from three time slices of 20th century psychiatry. From the first time slice, 1913 and the publication of Jaspers' General Psychopathology, the lesson is that translational research in psychiatry requires a pluralistic approach encompassing equally the sciences of mind (including the social sciences) and of brain. From the second time slice, 1959 and a conference in New York from which our present symptom-based classifications are derived, the lesson is that, while reliability remains the basis of psychiatry as an observational science, validity too is essential to effective translation. From the third time slice, 1997 and a conference on psychiatric classification in Dallas that brought together patients and carers with researchers and clinicians, the lesson is that we need to build further on collaborative models of research combining expertise-by-training with expertise-by-experience. This is important if we are to meet the specific challenges to translation presented by the complexity of the concept of mental disorder, particularly as reflected in the diversity of desired treatment outcomes. Taken together, these three lessons - a pluralistic approach, reliability and validity, and closer collaboration among relevant stakeholders - provide an emerging framework for more effective translation of research into practice in 21st century psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Historical and conceptual evolution of non-schizophrenic psychotic disorders in DSM].", "Abstract": "After firmly established the \"kraepelinean dichotomy\" (dementia praecox - manic-depressive insanity), classical psychiatry began to describe a group of psychotic disorders which did not fit in any of these main diagnoses.

This may conduce to over diagnosis and overtreatment, which is the main criticism of the DSM system. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) launched recently the DSM-5, the fifth edition of its diagnostic manual, which provides diagnostic criteria for thousands of psychiatrist, psychologist and researchers and who will be using it in the next coming years. DSM-5, like the preceding editions, placed disorders in discrete categories such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. The problem is that scientists have been unable to find yet a genetic or neurobiological evidence to support the theory of mental disorders as separate categories. Several authors wanted the latest DSM to move away from the category model towards a new \"dimensional approach\", where disorders can be measured and mental illnesses overlapping can be reduced. Recent findings supports this new dimensional strategy, suggesting that the disorders are a product of shared risk factors that lead to abnormalities in specific drives, which can be measured and used to place persons on one of several spectra. In some parts the DSM-5 entered changes aiming to achieve a greater objectivity. The door for new changes in each category, dimension or criteria has been opened, favoring an evidence-based development of the future versions. DSM-5 is presented as a \"living document\" that can be updated easily. However, the category model still remains for many disorders. The future research in psychiatric diagnostic systems requires more genetic-molecular and neurophysiological evidence and more objective multinational field trials, in order to confirm the existence of the new diagnostic entities, spectrums or dimensions. This approach may provide us reliable information about the pathogenesis, psychopathology, adequate taxonomy and treatment of mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Community mental health care in the future: nine proposals.", "Abstract": "The aim of this article was to put community psychiatry into a longitudinal and global perspective and to try to look into the future.

Health care services need to recognize the far lower life expectancy among people with mental disorders and develop and evaluate new methods to reduce this health disparity.3. Mental health services should provide specific modules to reduce stigma and discrimination experienced by people with mental illness.4. Mental health staff should provide care that service users (and their family members) find accessible and acceptable.5. Mental health care should consist of a careful balance of hospital and community care, with most care provided at or near people's homes.6. Mental health planners, both in times of economic growth and recession, should invest in treatments known to be effective and disinvest from treatments known to be ineffective or even harmful.7. Mental health staff and service users should develop and evaluate methods to improve shared decision making.8. Health care practitioners (of western and nonwestern traditions) should take practical steps to see each other as partners in an integrated system that increases the total amount of mental health care available, while ensuring that only effective and acceptable treatments are provided.9.

In the 1960s, Italian psychiatric culture had reached a deadlock because of its obsolete biological, strictly neuroanatomical, explanatory approach (so-called organicism) postulated by academic institutions and awkwardly implemented in asylum practice. One prominent figure in shaping this philosophy was Cesare Lombroso, internationally known as the father of criminal anthropology. This attitude became sharper and more oppressive during the Fascist regime, where international exchanges and collaboration were discouraged when not repressed. Thus, anachronistic was the situation in the 1960s that the anti-institutional movement founded and led by Franco Basaglia swept professionals, politicians, and public opinion in its wake.

Therefore, it is important to determine strengths and limitations of this modern-day care service. A starting point is to enquire from those who have been in receipt of their service and/or their respective carers. Aim This study aims to identify and describe the perceptions and experiences of past service users (SUs) and their carers, while in receipt of services from an acute mental health day hospital for Psychiatry of Later Life and to explore their needs/supports.\nA qualitative, exploratory, descriptive design was employed. Purposive sampling achieved a sample of 13 SUs and six carers. Inclusion criteria set were that the SU had a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder; had the capacity to make an informed consent and communicate verbally and the SU was discharged from the service between January and July 2011. Finally, carers of SUs in receipt of the service during this time were also included. Data were subjected to thematic, field analysis. Findings 'Person centredness' emerged as an overarching theme. Six inter-related subthemes revealing how SUs and carers viewed their care emerged from the interviews: 'therapeutic engagement'; 'preservation of self-integrity'; 'collaborative care'; 'integrated care'; 'social gains'; and 'the relationship between the expectation, subsequent engagement and the perceived outcome of care'.\nFindings concluded that high levels of care exist within this service. Strengths lie in the development of a therapeutic relationship, preservation of self-integrity, social gains and robust elements of person-centred holistic, integrated and collaborative care Recommendations support the enhancement of a cohesive planned approach to admission, discharge/transition (integrated pathway)."}, {"Title": "Compliance with the Data Protection Acts in a psychiatric department: a complete audit cycle.", "Abstract": "Aim 1) to assess compliance with the Data Protection Acts (DPA) by a Department of Psychiatry in a general hospital, 2) to implement measures that are likely to maximize compliance with the hospital data protection policy, 3) to close the audit cycle by assessing the impact of such measures on departmental compliance with the DPA over five months period.\nAn individual, anonymised staff questionnaire on data collection practices, procedure of disclosure of data to third parties and previous training on DPA was used to collect information from the department staff. The premises were inspected at different times over a week period using structured checklist. Default points were recorded during each inspection. Post-audit interventions included a mixture of educational interventions and practical solutions. A re-audited took place five months later using the same method.\nThe baseline audit demonstrated significant lack of compliance with the DPA among staff members and lack of staff training on the DPA. Following the interventions, staff awareness of the requirements of the act rose which in turn lead to better adherence to recommend practices in data handling and to mean default points dropped significantly. Management of manual files appears to constitute the biggest problem in this audit. Daytime breaks were found to pose higher risk to stored data compared with before and after working hours.\nA combination of educational and practical interventions including training of staff on the DPA results in overall improvement in compliance and reduction in default points.

It is unknown whether similar network abnormalities are present in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with a history of affective psychopathology.\n17 TLE patients with a lifetime affective diagnosis, 31 TLE patients with no formal psychiatric history and 30 HVs were included. We used a visuo-spatial 'n-back' paradigm to compare working memory (WM) network activation between these groups. Post hoc analyses included voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging. The Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen and Beck Anxiety Inventory were completed on the day of scanning.\nEach group activated the fronto-parietal WM networks and deactivated the typical DMN in response to increasing task demands. Group comparison revealed that TLE patients with lifetime affective morbidity showed significantly greater deactivation in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC) than either the TLE-only or the HVs (p<0.001). This effect persisted after covarying for current psychotropic medication and severity of current depressive/anxiety symptoms (all p<0.001). Correlational analysis revealed that this finding was not driven by differences in task performance. There were no significant differences in grey matter volume or structural connectivity between the TLE groups.\nOur results provide novel evidence suggesting that affective psychopathology in TLE has a neurobiological correlate, and in this context the sACC performs differently compared with network activity in primary affective disorders."}, {"Title": "Formulation for beginners.", "Abstract": "Developing a formulation is an important method of understanding the people we treat.

Human telomeres are regions of tandem TTAGGG repeats at chromosomal ends that protect chromosomes from degradation, fusion, and recombination. They are made up of approximately 1000-2500 copies of the repeated DNA sequence. Over time, at each cell division, the telomere ends become shorter. Thus, telomere length (TL) has been considered a cellular marker for age-related diseases. In addition to biochemical stressors such as oxidation and inflammation, psychosocial traumatic stress has also been linked to shorter telomeres. TL is significantly inversely correlated with long-term depression, even after controlling for age. Average TL in depressed subjects, who were above the median of lifetime depression, was 281 base pairs shorter than that in controls, corresponding to approximately 7years of accelerated cell aging. Several recent studies have also demonstrated an inverse relationship between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and the risk of PTSD. TL was inversely correlated with the duration of caregiving and PTSD. Here, we focus on the discussion of findings in studies of the relationships between stress-related disorders (e.g., depression and PTSD) and telomeres. We also present direct evidence that TL is associated with traumatic stress, depression, and PTSD, and hypothesize that traumatic stress affects not only mental disorders but also cellular aging. The nature of this relationship between stress and TL warrants further evaluation in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Factors Associated with Parental Satisfaction with a Pediatric Crisis Clinic (PCC).", "Abstract": "Little is known about parental satisfaction with pediatric crisis clinics (PCCs) that provide a single consultation to families in need of urgent psychiatric care.

Both the increasing interest in the molecular aspect of neuropsychiatry and the availability of high-throughput discovery and analysis tools have encouraged the incorporation of bioinformatics and neurosystems biology techniques into psychiatry and neuroscience research. As applied to neuropsychiatry, systems biology involves the acquisition and processing of high-throughput datasets to infer new information. A major component in bioinformatics output is pathway analysis that provides an insight into and prediction of possible underlying pathogenic processes which may help understand disease pathogenesis. In addition, this analysis serves as a tool to identify potential biomarkers implicated in these disorders.

The presence of mental illness is the most important risk factor for suicide. Affective disorders contribute to 15-25% of deaths due to suicide attempts. Depression is the most likely cause of the patients attempt on his life. Contrary to popular opinion, manic episode can also increase the risk of suicide, especially if the patient dominates by productive symptoms in the form of delusions. The aim of study was to determine the frequency of suicide attempts and their determinants in an episode of mania in bipolar disorder.\nThe study included 16 people with a diagnosed bipolar disorder, hospitalized with manic episode at the age of 28-76. Patients hospitalized in the Department of Adult Psychiatry were selected randomly. The number of suicide attempts, comorbid conditions, and basic epidemiological data were estimated.\nFive patients declared suicide attempt, one of which wanted to make more than one attempt at suicide. 3 people took it during an episode of depression, two in an episode of mania. The methods of suicide were associated with an overdose of medication and this was accompanied by a greater amount of alcohol intake. 11 persons did not declare any willingness to attempt suicide.\nA mania episode did not increase the risk of suicide in bipolar disorder compared to an episode of depression in the study conducted. The importance of somatic illness in patients with bipolar disorder is increased if the suicide attempt occurs in an episode of depression. Alcohol abuse showed no negative effects on suicidal behavior of patients. During abuse was the most common way of commit suicide."}, {"Title": "Development of a professionalism committee approach to address unprofessional medical staff behavior at an academic medical center.", "Abstract": "The Joint Commission Leadership standard on the need to create and maintain a culture of safety and quality and to develop a code of conduct was based on the rationale that unprofessional behavior undermines a culture of safety and can thereby be harmful to patient care. Few reports have described effective and successful approaches to defining and managing unprofessional behavior. The Professionalism Committee (PC)-based approach at the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) may serve as a model for other hospitals and health systems.\nEach of the three large teaching hospitals within UPHS has a PC that reports to its respective Medical Executive Committee. The PCs serve as a resource for department chairs and hospital administrators to address unprofessional behavior among faculty. Key features of the PC include the PC chair as the first point of contact and the integration of psychiatry into the model by virtue of the Professionalism Committee chair's training and expertise in psychiatry.\nIn the 2009 calendar year, the PC chair received contacts concerning behavior of only 2 physicians, which increased to 42 physicians in 2011 and 39 in 2012. Contacts involved referrals, management consults, interview screening, and the need for general advice. Of 79 resolved cases, 30 involved interpersonal issues, and 2 were associated with poor clinical outcomes.\nOne key feature of the UPHS approach is early identification of the role of behavioral health issues in unprofessional behavior (as opposed to physical, cognitive, or systems issues) by virtue of the PC chair's professional training and expertise. Although aspects of the UPHS experience may not be generalizable, the PC structure and approach are replicable."}, {"Title": "[Medication adherence and use of health services in patients with psychosis in the region of Osona (Catalonia, Spain)].", "Abstract": "To describe and analyze sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, medication adherence and use of health resources by country of birth of psychosis diagnosed patients treated with long-term antipsychotic injectable drugs in the region of Osona (Catalonia, Spain).\nDescriptive observational study in psychosis diagnosed patients over 18 years old, receiving long-term antipsychotic injectable treatment and treated at a Mental Health Center for adults in Vic (Catalonia, Spain).\n185 patients were included, of them: 163 (88.1%) were born in Spain and 22 (17.9%) abroad.

Research in forensic institutional settings has reported that aggressive behaviour is a particularly prominent source of impairment among men with ADHD. However there is a paucity of research investigating the type of behavioural incidents that may arise in female offenders with ADHD. This pilot study therefore aimed to further our understanding of ADHD within a cohort of female mentally disordered offenders by ascertaining estimated rates of ADHD and associated functional disturbance presenting in this population. Fifty female offenders completed the Barkley ADHD rating scales. Data on aggressive and self-harming behaviours were obtained from patients' clinical records. Almost one-third of patients (28%) screened positive for ADHD, most commonly hyperactive/impulsive and combined subtypes. They were significantly younger than their peers and there were no significant differences in behavioural disturbance records between groups. When controlling for age, hyperactive/impulsive symptoms and combined symptoms were significantly and positively correlated with measures of behavioural disturbance. ADHD symptoms correlated more strongly with self-harm than outward aggression, which is a novel finding. This pilot study has contributed to the knowledge base about the rate and functional problems of female offenders with ADHD.

It both motivates and reinforces new behavior. In this review we analyze and apply a novel approach to this process based on AGM theory of belief revision, named after its proponents, Carlos Alchourr\u00f3n, Peter G\u00e4rdenfors and David Makinson. AGM is a set-theoretical model. We reconceptualize it as describing a non-linear, dynamical system that occurs within a semantic space, which can be represented as a phase plane comprising all of the brain's attentional, cognitive, affective and physiological resources. Triggering events, such as anxiety-producing or depressing situations in the real world, or their imaginal equivalents, mobilize these assets so they converge on an equilibrium point. A preference function then evaluates and integrates evidentiary data associated with individual beliefs, selecting some of them and comprising them into a belief set, which is a metastable state. Belief sets evolve in time from one metastable state to another. In the phase space, this evolution creates a heteroclinic channel. AGM regulates this process and characterizes the outcome at each equilibrium point. Its objective is to define the necessary and sufficient conditions for belief revision by simultaneously minimizing the set of new beliefs that have to be adopted, and the set of old beliefs that have to be discarded or reformulated. Using AGM, belief revision can be modeled using three (and only three) fundamental syntactical operations performed on belief sets, which are expansion; revision; and contraction. Expansion is like adding a new belief without changing any old ones. Revision is like adding a new belief and changing old, inconsistent ones. Contraction is like changing an old belief without adding any new ones. We provide operationalized examples of this process in action."}, {"Title": "\"The wondrous eyes of a new technology\"-a history of the early electroencephalography (EEG) of psychopathy, delinquency, and immorality.", "Abstract": "This article presents a history of the early electroencephalography (EEG) of psychopathy, delinquency, and immorality in Great Britain and the United States in the 1940s and 1950s. Then, EEG was a novel research tool that promised ground-breaking insights in psychiatry and criminology. Experts explored its potential regarding the diagnosis, classification, etiology, and treatment of unethical and unlawful persons. This line of research yielded tentative and inconsistent findings, which the experts attributed to methodological and theoretical shortcomings. Accordingly, the scientific community discussed the reliability, validity, and utility of EEG, and launched initiatives to calibrate and standardize the novel tool. The analysis shows that knowledge production, gauging of the research tool, and attempts to establish credibility for EEG in the study of immoral persons occurred simultaneously.

Following a multiperspective concept, from Jaspers' viewpoint social psychiatry should consider itself of equal importance with biological and psychotherapeutic psychiatry. Therefore, uncritical generalization of one of these perspectives should be avoided. Personalized psychiatry, apart from searching biological markers to tailor treatment should identify psychosocial factors and subjective meaning. Concepts of recovery should not ignore biological foundations in mental disorders."}, {"Title": "[Predicting the Number of Office-Based Psychiatrists Needed in the Future: Potential and Limitations].", "Abstract": "This study discusses the potential and the limitations of medical workforce planning in outpatient psychiatry in Switzerland.\nHypotheses concerning selected factors influencing the number of office-based psychiatrists needed in the future were formulated. In a next step, those hypotheses were assigned to one of three scenarios (high, constant, and normal need development). On the basis of these three scenarios, the number of psychiatrists needed was calculated.\nTaken together, the results from the scenarios indicate an undersupply of office-based psychiatrists for the next 20 years.\nEstimating the number office-based psychiatrists needed in the future is basically feasible and reasonable.

The discourses of psychiatry and psychology contribute to the conflation of disparate forms of violence by emphasizing presumptively universal aspects of trauma response. Many proponents of this construct have made explicit analogies to the Holocaust as a way to understand the transgenerational effects of genocide. However, the social, cultural, and psychological contexts of the Holocaust and of post-colonial Indigenous \"survivance\" differ in many striking ways. Indeed, the comparison suggests that the persistent suffering of Indigenous peoples in the Americas reflects not so much past trauma as ongoing structural violence. The comparative study of genocide and other forms of massive, organized violence can do much to illuminate both common mechanisms and distinctive features, and trace the looping effects from political processes to individual experience and back again. The ethics and pragmatics of individual and collective healing, restitution, resilience, and recovery can be understood in terms of the self-vindicating loops between politics, structural violence, public discourse, and embodied experience."}, {"Title": "[Neurological soft signs in early onset schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "Neurological soft signs (NSS) are subtle neurological abnormalities that cannot be linked to the achievement of a specific region of the central nervous system and which are not part of a particular neurological syndrome. These signs are observed in the case of diseases supporting the neurodevelopmental model such as schizophrenia in general and its early form defined notably by an age of onset of less than 18 years. Indeed, the NSS belong to a set of clinical, cognitive, electrophysiological and neuroanatomical markers reflecting neurodevelopmental brain abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia.\nThe objectives of our study were to determine the prevalence, the scores, and the nature of neurological soft signs (NSS) in adolescent patients suffering from early onset schizophrenia diagnosis in comparison to healthy controls, and to explore the correlations between NSS and the demographic, clinical and therapeutic features of these patients.\nTwelve adolescents were recruited in the Child Psychiatry Department at the Razi Hospital (Tunisia), with the diagnosis of schizophrenia according to the DSM-IV supplemented by the Kiddie SAD PL. They were matched by age and educational level with twelve healthy controls without psychiatric family or personal history. The clinical status of the patients was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Neurological soft signs (NSS) were rated with the Neurological Soft Signs Examination (NSSE) by Krebs et al. (2000) for the two groups. This scale is composed of 23 items exploring motor coordination, motor integrative function, sensory integration, involuntary movements and quality of lateralization.\nThe mean age of our population was 14.7 years. The average age of onset of the disease was 12.2 years. The sex-ratio was 1.4. Educational level was 7.4 years. The PANSS mean total score was 74.3. The mean daily dose, in chlorpromazine equivalents, was 523.9 mg/day. Four patients received a strict monotherapy of antipsychotics, while the other patients were receiving an association of two neuroleptics. The prevalence of NSS was 100% (cut-off point=11) with a mean total score of 29.3\u00b14.1. The highest score was for the motor coordination (10.1). As for the control group, the mean total score was 7\u00b11.3. A highly significant difference was found between patients and controls for all sub-scores of NSS. Negative correlations were found in patients, between age and neurological soft signs total score (P=0.05; r=-0.57) and also with sensory integration score (P=0.04; r=-0.58). The NSS total score was also correlated with low educational level (P=0.03; r=-0.61). There was no correlation between neurological soft signs scores and PANSS scores or the daily dose of antipsychotics.\nThe prevalence and NSS scores are high among young people with early onset schizophrenia diagnosis illustrating the existence of structural abnormalities of the brain, themselves consequences of early neurodevelopmental disturbances, which would support the neurodevelopmental hypothesis concerning this pathology."}, {"Title": "The SATISPSY-22: development and validation of a French hospitalized patients' satisfaction questionnaire in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The aim of our study was to develop a specific French self-administered instrument for measuring hospitalized patients' satisfaction in psychiatry based on exclusive patient point of view: the SATISPSY-22.\nThe development of the SATISPSY was undertaken in three steps: item generation, item reduction, and validation. The content of the SATISPSY was derived from 80 interviews with patients hospitalized in psychiatry. Using item response and classical test theories, item reduction was performed in 2 hospitals on 270 responders. The validation was based on construct validity, reliability, and some aspects of external validity.\nThe SATISPSY contains 22 items describing 6 dimensions (staff, quality of care, personal experience, information, activity, and food). The six-factor structure accounted for 78.0% of the total variance. Each item achieved the 0.40 standard for item-internal consistency, and the Cronbach's alpha coefficients were>0.70. Scores of dimensions were strongly positively correlated with Visual Analogue Scale scores.

Increased recognition draws needed attention to individual suffering and the population impacts, but medicalizing global mental health produces a narrow view of the problems and solutions. Early framing by advocates of the global mental health problem emphasised biological disease, linked psychiatry with neurology, and reinforced categories of mental health disorders. Universality of biomedical concepts across culture is assumed in the globalisation of mental health but is strongly disputed by transcultural psychiatrists and anthropologists.

In addition to developments in organized psychiatry (e.g., American Psychiatric Association's LGBT caucus), grassroots LGBT community initiatives are playing an important role (e.g., Trevor Project providing crisis intervention/suicide prevention services to LGBT youth, face-to-face mental health services in LGBT community centers). Studies have found that LGBT individuals are at increased risk for mental health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety, substance misuse, suicidal ideation, self-harm). Mental health advocacy in the LGBT community has been slowed by the long-standing association of the concept of homosexuality with psychopathology in mainstream psychiatry (e.g., homosexuality was only removed from the DSM in 1973, ego dystonic homosexuality still appears in the ICD-10). However, positive developments in LGBT mental health advocacy have been fostered by the proposed minority stress model (i.e., that elevated risk of mental illness in LGBT individuals is a consequence of a hostile stressful environment). A particularly encouraging initiative is the It Gets Better Project, in which thousands of videos, some by prominent individuals, have been posted online to send a message of hope to LGBT youth facing harassment and low self-esteem."}, {"Title": "Relationship between sleep disturbance, pain, depression and functioning in long-term sick-listed patients experiencing difficulty in resuming work.", "Abstract": "To describe the frequency of reported sleeping, depression and pain problems, the severity of these problems and the degree of self-estimated difficulties in mental functions and activities in relation to the sleep disturbance and pain category group in patients on long-term sick-leave.\nCross-sectional study.\nA total of 1206 patients experiencing difficulty in resuming work.\nPatient examinations by specialists in psychiatry, orthopaedic surgery and rehabilitation medicine.

But older adults are also major consumers of over-the-counter (OTC) medications, which can be equally significant for self-care. Nearly half of older adults aged 75-85, for example, are regular users of an OTC product. Ensuring that consumers safely and effectively use OTC products is critical in order to minimize potential drug-drug interactions and unintentional misuse. Yet we know surprisingly little about the ways older adults select OTC medications and decide when to start or stop use, how older people actually take these medications, or how involved clinicians and family members are in older adult OTC behavior. Research in this area is critical for developing interventions to help ensure safe and appropriate OTC use. For this reason, The Gerontological Society of America (GSA), in partnership with the Consumer Healthcare Products Association (CHPA), convened a summit of experts to set an agenda for research in OTC behaviors among older adults. The panel suggested a need for research in 5 key areas: Health literacy and OTC behavior, decision making and OTC use, the role of clinicians in OTC medication behavior, older adult OTC behavior and family care, and technologies to promote optimal use of OTC medications."}, {"Title": "Development and implementation of a telehealth-enhanced intervention for pain and symptom management.", "Abstract": "Managing chronic pain effectively is often challenging for health care providers and patients. Telehealth technologies can bridge geographic distance and improve patients' quality of care in communities where access to pain specialists has previously been unavailable. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a telehealth intervention (TelePain) designed to address the need for pain specialist consultation regarding pain and symptom management issues in non-academic medical centers. We describe the theoretical foundation and development of a multifaceted intervention using a cluster randomized clinical trial design. Health care providers and their patients with chronic pain are enrolled in the study. Patient participants receive the intervention (report of symptoms and receipt of a pain graph) weekly for 8 weeks and are contacted at 12 weeks for completion of post-intervention follow-up measures. Their providers attend TelePain sessions which involve a didactic presentation on an evidence-based topic related to pain management followed by patient case presentations and discussion by community clinicians. Symptom management recommendations for each patient case are made by a panel of pain specialists representing internal medicine, addiction medicine, rehabilitation medicine, anesthesiology, psychiatry, and nursing. The outcomes assessed in this randomized trial focus on pain intensity, pain's interference on function and sleep, and anxiety, depression, and cost-effectiveness. Some of the challenges and lessons that we have learned early in implementing the TelePain intervention are also reported."}, {"Title": "Treating psychosis in movement disorder patients: a review.", "Abstract": "Psychosis is a major psychiatric problem that often occurs at the interface of psychiatry and the neurological specialty of movement disorders. Psychotic syndromes are common in treated movement disorder patients, and almost all antipsychotic drugs produce movement disorders. There is little published data on psychosis in movement disorders aside from Parkinson's disease (PD).\nIn this review, we focus primarily on PD, in which about 30% of treated patients have visual hallucinations and 5-10% have paranoid delusions; dementia with Lewy bodies, a variant of PD in which dementia occurs early and psychotic symptoms are common; Huntington's disease (HD), an inherited disorder that causes behavioral problems, frequently including psychosis; and tardive dyskinesia (TD), a group of movement disorder syndromes caused by antipsychotic drugs. All articles were reviewed in each of the more common movement disorders and indexed in PubMed with keywords including psychosis, psychotic symptoms, antipsychotics, hallucinations and delusions.\nAlthough there are no approved drugs for treating psychotic symptoms in any of the movement disorders, pimavanserin, a 5-HT2A inverse agonist, is thought likely to gain approval in 2015 for treating PD psychosis. We present evidence that clozapine is currently the drug of choice for treating psychosis in patients with parkinsonism; however, blood monitoring requirements make it difficult to use.

Healthcare workers interpretation of organizational relations mined from electronic health records.", "Abstract": "Models of healthcare organizations (HCOs) are often defined up front by a select few administrative officials and managers. However, given the size and complexity of modern healthcare systems, this practice does not scale easily. The goal of this work is to investigate the extent to which organizational relationships can be automatically learned from utilization patterns of electronic health record (EHR) systems.\nWe designed an online survey to solicit the perspectives of employees of a large academic medical center. We surveyed employees from two administrative areas: (1) Coding & Charge Entry and (2) Medical Information Services and two clinical areas: (3) Anesthesiology and (4) Psychiatry. To test our hypotheses we selected two administrative units that have work-related responsibilities with electronic records; however, for the clinical areas we selected two disciplines with very different patient responsibilities and whose accesses and people who accessed were similar. We provided each group of employees with questions regarding the chance of interaction between areas in the medical center in the form of association rules (e.g., Given someone from Coding & Charge Entry accessed a patient's record, what is the chance that someone from Medical Information Services access the same record?). We compared the respondent predictions with the rules learned from actual EHR utilization using linear-mixed effects regression models.\nThe findings from our survey confirm that medical center employees can distinguish between association rules of high and non-high likelihood when their own area is involved. Moreover, they can make such distinctions between for any HCO area in this survey. It was further observed that, with respect to highly likely interactions, respondents from certain areas were significantly better than other respondents at making such distinctions and certain areas' associations were more distinguishable than others.\nThese results illustrate that EHR utilization patterns may be consistent with the expectations of HCO employees. Our findings show that certain areas in the HCO are easier than others for employees to assess, which suggests that automated learning strategies may yield more accurate models of healthcare organizations than those based on the perspectives of a select few individuals."}, {"Title": "Stigma towards mental illness among medical students in Australia and Ghana.", "Abstract": "Stigma towards mental illness has been found to impact adversely on medical students' attitudes towards psychiatry.

A large number of individuals is feeling overburdened at work. In contrast to mental disorders, the term 'burnout' is not perceived as stigmatizing, making it therefore easier for afflicted persons to seek help. The term 'burnout syndrome' was mentioned 1974 for the first time in scientific literature. Today, there is a range of partially contradictory definitions and explanations for burnout and the burnout syndrome, respectively. In most studies, burnout is assessed by the Maslach Burnout Inventory, which is neither useful for determining the degree of pathology nor for distinguishing burnout from mental disorders such as depression. It is expected that the burnout syndrome will not be used in modern diagnostic classification systems, because of its unclear definition and conceptual contradictions. On these grounds, it appears reasonable to define burnout as long-term professional overload and a noteworthy risk factor for physical diseases and mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Conceptualizing genetic counseling as psychotherapy in the era of genomic medicine.", "Abstract": "Discussions about genetic contributions to medical illness have become increasingly commonplace. Physicians and other health-care providers in all quarters of medicine, from oncology to psychiatry, routinely field questions about the genetic basis of the medical conditions they treat. Communication about genetic testing and risk also enter into these conversations, as knowledge about genetics is increasingly expected of all medical specialists. Attendant to this evolving medical landscape is some uncertainty regarding the future of the genetic counseling profession, with the potential for both increases and decreases in demand for genetic counselors being possible outcomes. This emerging uncertainty provides the opportunity to explicitly conceptualize the potentially distinct value and contributions of the genetic counselor over and above education about genetics and risk that may be provided by other health professionals. In this paper we suggest conceptualizing genetic counseling as a highly circumscribed form of psychotherapy in which effective communication of genetic information is a central therapeutic goal. While such an approach is by no means new--in 1979 Seymour Kessler explicitly described genetic counseling as a \"kind of psychotherapeutic encounter,\" an \"interaction with a psychotherapeutic potential\"--we expand on his view, and provide research evidence in support of our position. We review available evidence from process and outcome studies showing that genetic counseling is a therapeutic encounter that cannot be reduced to one where the counselor performs a simple \"conduit for information\" function, without losing effectiveness. We then discuss potential barriers that may have impeded greater uptake of a psychotherapeutic model of practice, and close by discussing implications for practice."}, {"Title": "Breastfeeding and parafunctional oral habits in children with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "Although children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were reported to have insufficient breastfeeding, consequences and oropharyngeal implications of this finding have not been studied.

In this study, we extended this idea to 5-HT2A receptor clusters in a similar patient population.\nWe collected blood samples from a subset of patients from our previous study on SERT clustering (20 untreated and newly diagnosed depression patients, and 20 matched control subjects). Blood samples were collected at the time of diagnosis and after 8 weeks of pharmacological treatment and at analogous times in control subjects. We used the Hamilton scale to quantify the level of depression in patients both before and after treatment. We then used immunocytochemistry to assess 5-HT2A receptor clusters in lymphocytes at the same time points.\nWe found that both the size and number of 5-HT2A receptor clusters were increased in na\u00efve depression patients compared to control subjects. Interestingly, there were individual differences in the distribution of 5-HT2A receptor cluster size that allowed us to differentiate the depression patients into two subgroups: a D-I group and a D-II group. After 8 weeks of pharmacological treatment, patients in both groups showed an improvement of symptoms, but patients in the D-II group had a much better outcome with many of them showing remission of symptoms. Furthermore, although treatment decreased cluster number and size in both D-I and D-II groups, only the D-II patients showed an increase in the number of clusters within the modal peak. Importantly, the same patients that belonged in the D-I or D-II groups in the present report were also assigned to the same groups in our previous study on SERT clustering.\nThe data should be replicated within a proper clinical trial.\n5-HT2A receptor clusters in peripheral lymphocytes are altered in major depression, partially reversed by antidepressant treatment, and may be considered a putative biomarker of therapeutic efficacy in major depression."}, {"Title": "Leo Eitinger MD: tribute to a Holocaust survivor, humane physician and friend of mankind.", "Abstract": "Born in Czechoslovakia, psychiatrist Leo Eitinger (1912-1996) became internationally recognized for research on his fellow concentration camp inmates. He graduated as an MD in 1937, but being Jewish was prohibited from practicing as a doctor. When the Nazis occupied the area he was forced to flee to Norway, where in 1940 he was again deprived of his right to practice medicine. In 1942 he was arrested and deported to Auschwitz. There, as a physician inmate, he was able to help and in many cases save his fellow prisoners, not only with his medical skills but by falsifying prisoners' documents and hiding them from their Nazi captors. One of his patients was Elie Wiesel. Eitinger survived the camps but was forced to join a \"death march.\" After the war he resumed medical practice in Norway, specializing in psychiatry. With his personal experience and knowledge of the suffering of camp survivors, he dedicated his life to studying the psychological effects of traumatic stress in different groups. Eitinger's academic contributions were crucial in the development of this area of research--namely, the effects of excessive stress, laying the foundations for the definition of post-traumatic stress disorder and the post-concentration camp syndrome, thus facilitating recognition of the medical and psychological post-war conditions of the survivors and their resultant disability pensions."}, {"Title": "The structure of psychiatric science.", "Abstract": "This essay addresses two interrelated questions: What is the structure of current psychiatric science and what should its goals be? The author analyzed all studies addressing the etiology of psychiatric disorders in the first four 2013 issues of 12 psychiatry and psychology journals. He classified the resulting 197 articles by the risk factors examined using five biological, four psychological, and three environmental levels. The risk factors were widely dispersed across levels, suggesting that our field is inherently multilevel and already practicing empirically based pluralism. However, over two-thirds of the studies had a within-level focus. Two cross-level patterns emerged between 1) systems neuroscience and neuropsychology and 2) molecular or latent genetic factors and environmental risks. The author suggests three fundamental goals for etiological psychiatric research. The first is an eclectic effort to clarify risk factors regardless of level, including those assessed using imaginative understanding, with careful attention to causal inference. An interventionist framework focusing on isolating causal effects is recommended for this effort. The second goal is to clarify mechanisms of illness that will require tracing causal pathways across levels downward to biological neuroscience and upward to social factors, thereby elucidating the important cross-level interactions. Here the philosophy of biology literature on mechanisms can be a useful guide. Third, we have to trace the effects of these causal pathways back up into the mental realm, moving from the Jasperian level of explanation to that of understanding. This final effort will help us expand our empathic abilities to better understand how symptoms are experienced in the minds of our patients."}, {"Title": "How clinicians use prescription drug monitoring programs: a qualitative inquiry.", "Abstract": "Prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) are now active in most states to assist clinicians in identifying potential controlled drug misuse, diversion, or excessive prescribing. Little is still known about the ways in which they are incorporated into workflow and clinical decision making, what barriers continue to exist, and how clinicians are sharing PDMP results with their patients.\nQualitative data were collected through online focus groups and telephone interviews.\nClinicians from pain management, emergency and family medicine, psychiatry/behavioral health, rehabilitation medicine, internal medicine and dentistry participated.\nThirty-five clinicians from nine states participated.\nWe conducted two online focus groups and seven telephone interviews. A multidisciplinary team then used a grounded theory approach coupled with an immersion-crystallization strategy for identifying key themes in the resulting transcripts.\nSome participants, mainly from pain clinics, reported checking the PDMP with every patient, every time. Others checked only for new patients, for new opioid prescriptions, or for patients for whom they suspected abuse. Participants described varied approaches to sharing PDMP information with patients, including openly discussing potential addiction or safety concerns, avoiding discussion altogether, and approaching discussion confrontationally. Participants described patient anger or denial as a common response and noted the role of patient satisfaction surveys as an influence on prescribing.\nRoutines for accessing PDMP data and how clinicians respond to it vary widely. As PDMP use becomes more widespread, it will be important to understand what approaches are most effective for identifying and addressing unsafe medication use."}, {"Title": "Teaching Motivational Interviewing Skills to Psychiatry Trainees: Findings of a National Survey.", "Abstract": "The authors report on the current status of motivational interviewing education and training director attitudes about providing it to psychiatry residents.\nTraining directors of general, child/adolescent and addiction psychiatry training programs were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey.\nOf the 333 training directors who were invited to participate, 66 of 168 (39.3%) general, 41 of 121 (33.9%) child/adolescent, and 19 of 44 (43.2%) addiction psychiatry training directors completed the survey.

Without the validation of the medical profession, the psychedelic drugs, and those who take them off-license, remain archaic sentiments of the past, with the users maligned as recreational drug abusers and subject to continued negative opinion. These two disparate groups--psychiatrists and recreational psychedelic drug users--are united by their shared recognition of the healing potential of these compounds. A resolution of this conflict is essential for the future of psychiatric medicine and psychedelic culture alike. Progression will come from professionals working in the field adapting to fit a conservative paradigm. In this way, they can provide the public with important treatments and also raise the profile of expanded consciousness in mainstream society."}, {"Title": "Managing transition with support: experiences of transition from child and adolescent psychiatry to general adult psychiatry narrated by young adults and relatives.", "Abstract": "Young adults with mental illness who need continuing care when they turn 18 are referred from child and adolescent psychiatry to general adult psychiatry. During this process, young adults are undergoing multiple transitions as they come of age while they transfer to another unit in healthcare. The aim of this study was to explore expectations and experiences of transition from child and adolescent psychiatry to general adult psychiatry as narrated by young adults and relatives. Individual interviews were conducted with three young adults and six relatives and analysed according to grounded theory. The analysis resulted in a core category: managing transition with support, and three categories: being of age but not mature, walking out of security and into uncertainty, and feeling omitted and handling concerns. The young adults' and relatives' main concerns were that they might be left out and feel uncertainty about the new situation during the transition process. To facilitate the transition process, individual care planning is needed. It is essential that young adults and relatives are participating in the process to be prepared for the changes and achieve a successful transition. Knowledge about the simultaneous processes seems to be an important issue for facilitating transition."}, {"Title": "Integrating psychosocial concepts into psychopharmacology training: a survey study of program directors and chief residents.", "Abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests that psychiatric medication outcomes are shaped significantly by psychological and social factors surrounding the prescribing process. Little, however, is known about the extent to which psychiatry programs integrate this evidence base into residency training or the methods by which this is accomplished. Psychiatry residency program directors and chief residents participated in an exploratory online survey to establish how psychosocial factors known to impact medication outcomes are integrated into psychopharmacology education. While participants highly valued the importance of psychosocial factors in the prescribing process, there was limited emphasis of these factors in psychopharmacology training. Additionally, some teaching methods that could advance understanding of complex interactions in the psychopharmacology relationship were found to be underutilized. Given that medication outcomes are significantly influenced by psychosocial factors, psychiatric educators have a responsibility to teach residents about the evidence base available. Residents exposed to this evidence base will be better equipped to manage the complexities of the psychopharmacology role. The results of this study offer clues as to how psychosocial factors may be more fully integrated into residency psychopharmacology training."}, {"Title": "Practitioner review: A critical perspective on gene-environment interaction models--what impact should they have on clinical perceptions and practice?", "Abstract": "Psychiatric disorders run in families, and early twin, family and adoption studies confirmed that this was due in part to shared genetic inheritance. While candidate gene studies largely failed to reliably identify genetic variants associated with psychiatric disorders, genome-wide association studies are beginning to do so. However, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained remains well below what would be expected from previous heritability estimates.\nWe review possible reasons for this 'missing heritability', and whether incorporating gene by environment interactions into our models will substantially improve our understanding of the aetiology of psychiatric disorders, and inform clinical perceptions and practice.\nWe discuss potential limitations of the gene by environment interaction approach. In particular, we discuss whether these are likely to be a major contributor to psychiatric disorders at the level of the specific interaction (as opposed to at an aggregate level).\nGene by environment interaction studies offered initial promise that a far greater proportion of phenotypic variance could be explained by incorporating measures of environmental exposures into genetic studies. However, in our opinion, there are few (if any) clear examples of gene by environment interactions in psychiatry, and their scope for informing either our understanding of disease pathology or clinical practice remains limited at present."}, {"Title": "[Safety and tolerability of psychotropic medications in childhood: preliminary data of a pharmacovigilance study].", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of psychotropic medications in childhood.\nOne hundred and two children and adolescents (M 82.4%, F 17.6%) followed-up at the Division of Child Neurology and Psychiatry at the University of Messina, and at the Scientific Institute Child Neurology and Psychiatry, IRCCS Stella Maris, Calambrone, Pisa, were recruited between January 2009 and December 2011.

The authors extracted representative themes and relevant empirical findings. They contextualized their findings within today's admission milieu.\nA total of 1,548 citations were identified with 20 papers included in the review. SSH premedical education is predominately an American experience. For medical students with SSH background, equivalent academic, clinical, and research performance compared with medical students with a premedical science background is reported, yet different patterns of competencies exist. Post-medical-school equivalent or improved clinical performance is associated with an SSH background. Medical students with SSH backgrounds were more likely to select primary care or psychiatry careers. SSH major/course concentration, not SSH course counts, is important for admission decision making. The impact of today's admission milieu decreases the value of an SSH premedical education.\nMedical students with SSH premedical education perform on par with peers yet may possess different patterns of competencies, research, and career interests. However, SSH premedical education likely will not attain a significant role in medical school admission processes."}, {"Title": "Bipolar disorder and multiple sclerosis: a case series.", "Abstract": "The prevalence of psychiatric disturbance for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is higher than that observed in other chronic health conditions. We report three cases of MS and bipolar disorder and we discuss the possible etiological hypothesis and treatment options.\nAll patients fulfilled the McDonald criteria for MS. Two patients were followed up in psychiatry for manic or depressive symptoms before developing MS. A third patient was diagnosed with MS and developed deferred psychotic symptoms. Some clinical and radiological features are highlighted in our patients: one manic episode induced by high dose corticosteroids and one case of a new orbitofrontal MRI lesion concomitant with the emergence of psychiatric symptoms. All patients needed antipsychotic treatment with almost good tolerance for high dose corticosteroids and interferon beta treatment.\nMRI lesions suggest the possible implication of local MS-related brain damage in development of pure \"psychiatric fits\" in MS. Genetic susceptibility is another hypothesis for this association.

The questionnaire included 6 categories of clinically relevant material: metabolism of alcohol, short-term effects of alcohol, long-term effects of alcohol, AUD, alcohol withdrawal, and alcohol use in pregnancy. The KPAAQ was administered to 75 medical students in Years 4 and 5 from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel, during a relevant clinical rotation. Following the initial administration of the KPAAQ, the students attended a 60-minute lecture (in Hebrew) based on material from the University of Sydney's learning module on alcohol. The KPAAQ was readministered to the students immediately following the lecture.\nThe KPAAQ demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach \u03b1 =.92 for all questions) and validity r(209) =.674, P <.001. Knowledge of alcohol and alcoholism significantly increased after the educational intervention (F(2, 154) = 151.60, P <.001). Post hoc comparisons using the Scheffe test revealed a significant positive change in knowledge after students received the intervention (mean difference = 33, P <.001).\nThese initial findings suggest that the KPAAQ is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing medical student knowledge of psychiatric aspects of AUD over 6 clinical categories."}, {"Title": "Thirty-five years of community psychiatry in Italy.", "Abstract": "The Italian Psychiatric Reform of 1978 is reviewed here in terms of national/regional mental health (MH) policies and with the help of epidemiological data.

This explains a relevant interregional variability, despite several national MH plans. In a recent survey, compliance with national standards found homogeneous implementation on structural parameters but quite a variable one on functional parameters (continuity, coordination, accessibility, specialization). Epidemiological data show the impact of regional variability on the quality of treatment provided.

Not until 2008, after substantial pressure by public opinion and International Human Rights bodies, did the government approve a major reform transferring health care in prisons and forensic hospitals to the NHS. Forensic hospitals were to be progressively closed, and specialized small-scale facilities were to be developed for discharged offenders with mental illness, along with diversion schemes to ordinary community care.

Others are resilient and do not. How the activity of neural populations relates to the development of persistent craving behavior is not fully understood. Previous computational studies suggest that synchrony helps a network embed certain patterns of activity, although the role of synchrony in reward-dependent learning has been less studied. Increased synchrony has been reported as a marker for both susceptibility and resilience to developing persistent craving. Here we use computational simulations to study the effect of reward salience on the ability of synchronous input to embed a new pattern of activity into a neural population. Our main finding is that weak stimulus-reward correlations can facilitate the short-term repetition of a pattern of neural activity, while blocking long-term embedding of that pattern. Interestingly, synchrony did not have this dual effect on all patterns, which suggests that synchrony is more effective at embedding some patterns of activity than others. Our results demonstrate that synchrony can have opposing effects in networks sensitive to the correlation structure of their inputs, in this case the correlation between stimulus and reward.

The first is the historically conditioned 'readiness for directed perception' of, and thinking in terms of, ontologically distinct diseases. The clinical gaze of mental health professionals, the bureaucratic needs of health administration, the clinical and scientific utility of disease categories, and the practices of autism-oriented advocacy groups all imply a bias toward thinking about autism and related disorders as ontologically distinct psychiatric and scientific entities. Second, within the 'neuromolecular style of thought', mental disorders are more and more located at the neurobiological levels of the brain. In autism research, one of the biggest challenges is the identification of autism's neurobiological singularity. However, at a moment when biological and categorical approaches toward autism face serious empirical difficulties, a balance is established that holds together these two styles of thought. With a need to account for some of the most persistent uncertainties and conflicts in autism research, namely ubiquitous heterogeneity and a failure to identify disease specific biomarkers, the reframing of autism as a neurodevelopmental spectrum disorder satisfies the scientific, institutional and socio-political needs for stability and homogenization."}, {"Title": "Lithium: a promising treatment for fragile X syndrome.", "Abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited disorder that results in intellectual disability and a characteristic behavioral profile that includes autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sensory hypersensitivity, hyperarousal, and anxiety.

The development of animal models of fragile X syndrome 20 years ago has produced a considerable increase in our understanding of the consequences of the absence of FMRP on the structure and function of the nervous system. Some of the insights gained have led to proposals of treatment strategies that are based on cellular and molecular changes observed in animals lacking FMRP. One such proposal is treatment with lithium, a drug with a long history of clinical efficacy in psychiatry and a drug with newly described uses in degenerative disorders of the nervous system. Lithium treatment has been studied extensively in both mouse and fruit fly models of FXS, and it has been shown to reverse numerous behavioral, physiological, cellular, and molecular phenotypes.

Two sets of models were performed, ie, scores on the Satispsy-22 and scores on the QSH.\nNinety-one patients with schizophrenia were enrolled. After adjustment for confounding factors, patients with better personal experience during hospitalization (Satispsy-22) had a better psychological quality of life (SF36-mental composite score, \u03b2=0.37; P=0.004), and patients with higher levels of satisfaction with quality of care (Satispsy-22) showed better adherence to treatment (Medication Adherence Report Scale total score, \u03b2=-0.32; P=0.021). Higher QSH scores for staff and structure index were linked to better adherence with treatment (respectively, \u03b2=-0.33; P=0.019 and \u03b2=-0.30; P=0.032), but not with quality of life.\nSatisfaction was the only factor associated with quality of life and was one of the most important features associated with nonadherence. These findings confirm that satisfaction with hospitalization should not be neglected in clinical practice and that it may improve the management of patients with schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry trainees confidence as teachers, perceptions of supervisor support and opportunities for further training.", "Abstract": "To investigate psychiatry trainees' confidence in their role as teachers, their perceptions of support and preferences for a program to support this role.\nPsychiatry trainees in New South Wales (NSW) (Australia) in the first three years of psychiatry training (N = 118) were invited to complete a survey which included demographic data, self-assessment of teaching confidence and perceptions of support for teaching.\nA total of 63% (N = 74) agreed to participate.

Additional documentation, including the product dossier, package insert, pharmacokinetic studies, and poster presentations supplied by the manufacturer, was also evaluated.\nLevomilnacipran is the more potent enantiomer of milnacipran. It is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), dosed from 20 to 120 mg daily for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Efficacy and tolerability were established during 3 phase III randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials finding levomilnacipran to be significantly more efficacious than placebo in reduction of Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale scores. It is not known whether this agent is more efficacious than other antidepressants because direct comparison studies have not been conducted as of the time of this review.\nLevomilnacipran demonstrates efficacy and tolerability for short-term treatment of MDD in adults. Available evidence does not strongly indicate that there is a specific subpopulation of patients who would benefit from levomilnacipran over currently available SNRIs.

The encompassing purpose of this review was to establish how biofeedback interventions have been used to treat select psychiatric disorders [anxiety, autistic spectrum disorders, depression, dissociation, eating disorders, schizophrenia and psychoses] to date and provide a useful reference for consultation by clinicians and researchers planning to administer a biofeedback treatment. A systematic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and WOK databases and hand searches in Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback, and Journal of Neurotherapy, identified 227 articles; 63 of which are included within this review. Electroencephalographic neurofeedback constituted the most investigated modality (31.7%). Anxiety disorders were the most commonly treated (68.3%). Multi-modal biofeedback appeared most effective in significantly ameliorating symptoms, suggesting that targeting more than one physiological modality for bio-regulation increases therapeutic efficacy. Overall, 80.9% of articles reported some level of clinical amelioration related to biofeedback exposure, 65.0% to a statistically significant (p < .05) level of symptom reduction based on reported standardized clinical parameters.

Concerns are growing that financial ties of psychiatrists to the pharmaceutical industry may unduly influence professional judgments involving the primary interests of patients. Such conflicts of interest threaten the public trust in psychiatry. The goal of conflict of interest policies is to protect the integrity of professional judgment and to preserve public trust. The disclosure of individual and institutional financial relationships is a critical but limited first step in the process of identifying and responding to conflicts of interest. Conflict of interest policies and procedures can be strengthened by engaged psychiatrists, researchers, institutions, and professional associations in developing policies and consensus standards. Research on conflicts of interest can provide a stronger evidence base for policy design and implementation. Society has traditionally granted the medical profession considerable autonomy and may be willing to continue do so in the case of conflicts of interest. Nevertheless, concern is growing that stronger measures are needed. To avoid undue regulatory burdens, psychiatrists can play a vital role in designing responsible and reasonable conflict of interest policies that reduce the risks of bias and the loss of trust.

This uniquely Yugoslav war trauma-'partisan hysteria'-was diagnosed exclusively in Communist resistance soldiers-partisans-and did not manifest itself in the form of battle exhaustion or anxiety, as was the case in other armies. Rather, it demonstrated a heightened willingness to fight, and consisted of simulations of wartime battles. Yugoslav psychiatrists argued that 'partisan hysteria' most frequently affected uneducated and immature partisans, who were given important political responsibilities but experienced severe trauma due to their own inadequacy. I argue that 'partisan hysteria' served as an opportunity for upper-middle-class psychiatric professionals to criticise the increasing upward social mobility after the socialist revolution of 1945. Surprisingly, this touched upon an issue that had already provoked deep disquiet within the Communist Party, and resonated with the Party's own concerns regarding social mobility."}, {"Title": "Cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate in posttraumatic stress disorder and their relationships to self-reported sleep quality.", "Abstract": "To test if posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with low brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels and if reduced GABA is mediated by poor sleep quality.\nLaboratory study using in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) and behavioral testing.\nVA Medical Center Research Service, Psychiatry and Radiology.\nTwenty-seven patients with PTSD (PTSD+) and 18 trauma-exposed controls without PTSD (PTSD-), recruited from United States Army reservists, Army National Guard, and mental health clinics.\nNone.\n1H MRS at 4 Tesla yielded spectra from three cortical brain regions. In parieto-occipital and temporal cortices, PTSD+ had lower GABA concentrations than PTSD-. As expected, PTSD+ had higher depressive and anxiety symptom scores and a higher Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score. Higher ISI correlated with lower GABA and higher glutamate levels in parieto-occipital cortex and tended to correlate with lower GABA in the anterior cingulate. The relationship between parieto-occipital GABA and PTSD diagnosis was fully mediated through insomnia severity. Lower N-acetylaspartate and glutamate concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex correlated with higher arousal scores, whereas depressive and anxiety symptoms did generally not influence metabolite concentrations.\nLow brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is consistent with most findings in panic and social anxiety disorders. Low GABA associated with poor sleep quality is consistent with the hyperarousal theory of both primary insomnia and PTSD. Our data demonstrate that poor sleep quality mediates low parieto-occipital GABA in PTSD. The findings have implications for PTSD treatment approaches."}, {"Title": "From networking to next-working: how an academic department \"retreated\" and advanced at the same time.", "Abstract": "Department-wide retreats conducted at periods of transition can enrich and benefit academic departments in several ways. Here, the authors describe the organization, conduct, and immediate outcomes of a department-wide retreat in a university department of psychiatry intended to (1) foster networking and communication among faculty who often work in \"silos\" and (2) invite the faculty to provide \"internal consultations\" regarding aspirational strategic goals and recommendations for short-term actionable tactics to address these goals. The retreat featured an evening networking and socializing poster session followed by a day-long event consisting of small group and large group interactive sessions. Participants were 120 faculty members including 44 new and younger faculty members who prepared and presented posters about themselves and their work. A variety of aspirational goals and specific recommendations for follow-up emerged from small groups were discussed in plenary sessions and were subsequently summarized and distributed to the faculty to be addressed by ongoing workgroups. Immediate informal feedback suggests that conducting and acting on recommendations ensuing from academic department retreats can foster at least a short-term sense of shared community and purpose, network faculty, identify commonly held values and aspirational goals, and potentially stimulate formation of innovative affinity groups and collaborations. Longer-term workgroup efforts and outcome assessments are required to assess the enduring results and value of such undertakings."}, {"Title": "Evaluating the utility, reliability, and validity of a resident performance evaluation instrument.", "Abstract": "The primary goal of this project was to create and evaluate the utility, validity, and reliability of an instrument assessing resident performance during child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) training. In three stages, the instrument was developed and evaluated for utility in assessing skills critical to CAP. Items on the Global Assessment Evaluation (GAE) were derived from the six core competencies identified by the American College of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). Secondary goals included producing an instrument that could be used by other CAP training programs and describing a process that could be followed by training programs to create their own assessment instruments.\nFaculty members developed a CAP resident performance evaluation instrument. In a three-stage process, faculty utilized the tool to evaluate residents during and after rotations. Statistical findings guided revisions to improve the utility and reliability of the instrument. For the final version of the GAE, intra-class correlation coefficients were calculated to assess inter-rater reliability, and Principal Components Analysis provided further insight into the dimensions of resident assessment.\nThe final version of the GAE showed overall and construct validity by capturing significant differences among residents and matched faculty members' overall impressions of resident performance. Intra-class correlation coefficient values for the overall score (0.945) and individual scales showed good reliability. Resident performance was not correlated with rotation site or model of care.\nThe GAE has proved a valuable instrument in tracking the progress, strengths, and weaknesses in resident performance over the course of training. Data from multiple evaluations over time provide useful information about resident performance in a way that one or few evaluations does not. This finding is consistent with the practice of semiannual reviews and the new Clinical Competency Committees, both of which are required by the ACGME."}, {"Title": "Dissociative identity disorder: An empirical overview.", "Abstract": "Despite its long and auspicious place in the history of psychiatry, dissociative identity disorder (DID) has been associated with controversy. This paper aims to examine the empirical data related to DID and outline the contextual challenges to its scientific investigation.\nThe overview is limited to DID-specific research in which one or more of the following conditions are met: (i) a sample of participants with DID was systematically investigated, (ii) psychometrically-sound measures were utilised, (iii) comparisons were made with other samples, (iv) DID was differentiated from other disorders, including other dissociative disorders, (v) extraneous variables were controlled or (vi) DID diagnosis was confirmed. Following an examination of challenges to research, data are organised around the validity and phenomenology of DID, its aetiology and epidemiology, the neurobiological and cognitive correlates of the disorder, and finally its treatment.\nDID was found to be a complex yet valid disorder across a range of markers. It can be accurately discriminated from other disorders, especially when structured diagnostic interviews assess identity alterations and amnesia. DID is aetiologically associated with a complex combination of developmental and cultural factors, including severe childhood relational trauma. The prevalence of DID appears highest in emergency psychiatric settings and affects approximately 1% of the general population. Psychobiological studies are beginning to identify clear correlates of DID associated with diverse brain areas and cognitive functions. They are also providing an understanding of the potential metacognitive origins of amnesia. Phase-oriented empirically-guided treatments are emerging for DID.\nThe empirical literature on DID is accumulating, although some areas remain under-investigated. Existing data show DID as a complex, valid and not uncommon disorder, associated with developmental and cultural variables, that is amenable to psychotherapeutic intervention."}, {"Title": "Rapid response: email, immediacy, and medical humanitarianism in Aceh, Indonesia.", "Abstract": "After more than 20 years of sporadic separatist insurgency, the Free Aceh Movement and the Indonesian government signed an internationally brokered peace agreement in August 2005, just eight months after the Indian Ocean tsunami devastated Aceh's coastal communities. This article presents a medical humanitarian case study based on ethnographic data I collected while working for a large aid agency in post-conflict Aceh from 2005 to 2007. In December 2005, the agency faced the first test of its medical and negotiation capacities to provide psychiatric care to a recently amnestied political prisoner whose erratic behavior upon returning home led to his re-arrest and detention at a district police station. I juxtapose two methodological approaches-an ethnographic content analysis of the agency's email archive and field-based participant-observation-to recount contrasting narrative versions of the event. I use this contrast to illustrate and critique the immediacy of the humanitarian imperative that characterizes the industry. Immediacy is explored as both an urgent moral impulse to assist in a crisis and a form of mediation that seemingly projects neutral and transparent transmission of content. I argue that the sense of immediacy afforded by email enacts and amplifies the humanitarian imperative at the cost of abstracting elite humanitarian actors out of local and moral context. As a result, the management and mediation of this psychiatric case by email produced a bureaucratic model of care that failed to account for complex conditions of chronic political and medical instability on the ground."}, {"Title": "Evaluating psychiatric case-control studies using the STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational Studies in Epidemiology) statement.", "Abstract": "Case-control studies are important in developing clinical and public health knowledge.

We determined the rate of admission to a medical unit, the rate of counseling or psychiatric medication administration, and the estimated cost of nonmedical admissions (boarding) of patients on the medical unit.\nA total of 555 (50.1%) of 1108 patients on involuntary psychiatric holds were admitted to the pediatric medical unit. The majority (523 [94.2%]) were admitted for boarding because no psychiatric bed was available. Thirty-two (6.1%) patients admitted for isolated psychiatric reasons had counseling documented, and 105 (20.1%) received psychiatric medications. Patients admitted to an affiliated psychiatric hospital were significantly more likely to receive counseling and medications. Psychiatric patients were boarded in medical beds for 1169 days at an estimated cost of $2 232 790 or $4269 per patient over the 18-month period.\nWe found high admission rates of patients on involuntary psychiatric holds to a pediatric medical unit with little psychiatric treatment in 1 hospital.

IRIDeS, comprising 7 divisions and 36 laboratories with broad areas of specialization, from the humanities to natural sciences, aims to become a global center for the study of disasters and disaster mitigation, learning from and building upon past lessons in disaster management from Japan and around the world. In IRIDeS, the Department of Disaster Psychiatry is in charge of dealing with issues related to disaster psychiatry, including the psychosocial impact of disasters. Now, at more than 2 and a half years after the catastrophic disaster, the psychological impact actually seems to be getting stronger and wider, whereas the memory of the disaster seems to be waning in other areas of the country. In such a situation, where a number of problems need to be resolved, what can/should we do as psychiatrists? On the other hand, other natural disasters, such as storms and floods, have kept hitting Japan, and catastrophes seem to strike somewhere in the world every year. In addition, we need to prepare for the possibility of a Nankai Trough Quake and an earthquake directly hitting the Tokyo area, which may occur sometime in the future. Considering the situation, we need to establish an education system for disaster psychiatry, and proceed with research to collect useful information to prepare for coming disasters. The aim of our department is to integrate multi-faceted basic and clinical research approaches to investigate the following topics: 1) to identify social, psychological, and biological factors involved in the pathophysiology of and recovery from disaster-related mental health problems; 2) to develop systems for disaster prevention, disaster response, and recovery, considering disaster-related psychiatric and psychological issues; 3) to develop useful tools for the prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of disaster-related disorders; 4) to archive information regarding disaster psychiatry; and 5) to corporate with other countries regarding disaster-related psychiatric issues.

Furthermore, a major accident accompanied by exudation of radioactive material occurred in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. A statement regarding the victims' mental health was issued by the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology on May 21, 2011, which established the Department of Disaster Psychiatry for the provision and assurance of long-term mental care support for the victims. The Department of Disaster Psychiatry was consequently reformed in April 2012, focusing on the following objectives: to verify the validity of current mental support methods; to ensure disaster psychiatry and medical care in Japan; and to promote human resource development that can respond to future large-scale disasters. Mental health support for disaster victims is of highest priority. However, the mental health of relief personnel, who act as front liners during disasters (i. e., police officers, fire fighters, Self-Defense Forces, and health care workers), has often been neglected. Therefore, countermeasures for the problems faced by relief personnel are indispensable for a more effective reconstruction. Volunteers are also important members of the disaster relief team and they have witnessed the actual tragedy, and some have experienced burnout. Thus, they require sufficient mental health support, as do relief personnel. We thought that the mental health of disaster relief personnel is an important issue; thus, we report their mental health needs, the systematic correspondence to disaster stress, and our works for relief assistance. As first responders, relief personnel even without prior disaster education proceed to the area of disaster and may get injured. We therefore suggest that prior to the occurrence of any disaster, networking, education, and disaster awareness should be advocated among relief personnel and volunteers to safeguard their mental health. However, programs on these subjects remain insufficient. We extend our utmost respect and appreciation to the disaster relief workforce for doing their best to save lives. We hope that this aids in the reconstruction process of such affected areas."}, {"Title": "[Activity to prevent mental diseases after the Great East Japan Earthquake].", "Abstract": "Following the Great East Japan Earthquake, we have been supporting psychiatric hospitals and mental health and welfare centers in Miyagi Prefecture.

This paper seeks to focus on this lack of consideration, to speculate as to why that might be, and to offer some suggestions as to how to infuse some new vitality and vigor into this important area of law and social policy. In this article, first, I offer a brief explanation of TJ. Next, I discuss, also briefly, the impact (and the potential future greater impact) of the recently-ratified United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) on this area. Then, I consider the sparse commentary currently available on the intersection between TJ and international law in general, and will speculate as to why this is so sparse. Then, I offer some thoughts as to the TJ/international human rights law connection, looking specifically at three questions that require far more attention from this perspective (access to counsel, the use of state-sanctioned psychiatry as a tool of political oppression, and the potential redemptive power of the CRPD), and describe a research agenda that scholars might turn to in furtherance of the investigation of the relationships between therapeutic jurisprudence, international human rights law and mental disability law.

Unfortunately, without firsthand knowledge of each specific database, it can be difficult to judge the validity of such studies. Large databases that rely on administrative data, such as International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes, may misrepresent patient information and could thus affect the results of studies that use these data.\nThe present study uses obesity, an easily quantified and objective variable, as an example comorbidity to assess the accuracy of ICD-9 codes in the setting of their continued use in spine database studies.\nA cross-sectional study at a large academic medical center.\nAll patients spending at least one night in the hospital as an inpatient between April 1, 2013 and April 16, 2013.

Of 573 \"obese\" patients (calculated BMI 30-39.9), only 109 received the correct code (278.00), giving this ICD-9 code a sensitivity of 0.19. Of 174 \"morbidly obese\" patients (calculated BMI >40), only 84 received the correct code (278.01), giving this ICD-9 code a sensitivity of 0.48.\nUsing obesity as an example, this study highlights the potential errors inherent to using ICD-9-coded databases for spine surgery research. Should a study based on such data use \"obesity\" as a variable in any analyses, the reader should interpret these results with caution. We further suggest that obesity is likely not the only comorbidity to which these results apply. As database research continues to represent an increasing proportion of publications in the field of spine surgery, it is important to realize that study outcomes can be skewed by data accuracy, and, thus, should not be blindly accepted simply by virtue of large sample sizes."}, {"Title": "[Sibling therapy, a part of systemic family therapy].", "Abstract": "Sibling therapies are rarely used.

Its treatment is mainly based on cognitive behavioural therapies and habit modification procedures. However, the use of sleep promoting drugs and substances is widespread without being supported by clinical guidelines. Exogenous melatonin is a neurohormone marketed as a nutritional supplement that is being increasingly used in the management of sleep problems, and with no control over its use.

Several candidate genes have been proposed to play a role in the risk to develop antisocial behavior, and distinct brain imaging studies have shown that specific cortical areas may be functionally and/or structurally impaired in impulsive violent subjects on the basis of their genotypes. In this paper, we review the findings regarding four polymorphisms-MAOA (Monoamine oxidase A) uVNTR, SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter), member 4) 5HTTLPR, COMT (Catechol-O-methyltransferase) Val158Met and DRD4 (dopamine D4 receptor) VNTR 1-11-that all have been found to be associated with an increased vulnerability for antisocial and impulsive behavior in response to aversive environmental conditions. These results, however, have not been replicated by other studies, likely because of crucial methodological discrepancies, including variability in the criteria used to define antisocial behavior and assessment of environmental factors. Finally, it has been recently proposed that these genetic variants may actually increase the individual susceptibility not merely to the negative environmental factors, but to the positive ones as well. In this view, such alleles would play a wider modulatory role, by acting as \"plasticity\" rather than \"vulnerability\" genes. Overall, these findings have potential important implications that span well outside of neuroscience and psychiatry, to embrace ethics, philosophy, and the law itself, as they pose new challenges to the very notion of Free Will. Novel properly controlled studies that examine multi-allelic genetic profiles, rather than focusing on distinct single variants, will make it possible to achieve a clearer understanding of the molecular underpinnings of the nature by nurture interaction."}, {"Title": "Guidelines disconcordance in acute bipolar depression: data from the national Bipolar Mania Pathway Survey (BIPAS) in mainland China.", "Abstract": "With the recent attention to the importance of evidence-based medicine in psychiatry, a number of treatment guidelines have been published. This survey investigated prescribing pattern and predictors for guideline disconcordance in the acute treatment of bipolar depression across mainland China. Pharmacological treatments of 1078 patients with bipolar depression were examined. Guidelines disconcordance was determined by comparing the medication(s) patients were prescribed with the recommendation(s) in the guidelines of the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments. Predictors for guidelines discordance were analyzed with logistic regression. Of the 1078 patients, 50.2% patients were treated against treatment guidelines recommendations. The patients who were treated in general hospitals (OR\u200a=\u200a1.53, 95% CI 1.18-1.97), with a depressive episode (OR\u200a=\u200a1.67, 95% CI 1.27-2.19) and an older age at first onset (OR\u200a=\u200a1.62, 95% CI 1.15-2.28) were more likely to receive guideline-disconcordant treatment than their counterparts. In contrast, the patients with current mental comorbidity, an older age at study entry, a longer duration of disease, and more frequent episodes in past year were less likely to receive guideline-disconcordant treatments than their counterparts with an OR of 0.43 (95% CI 0.24-0.77), 0.52 (95CI% 0.36-0.75), 0.48 (95% CI 0.36-0.65), and 0.50 (95% CI 0.38-0.64), respectively. Our finding suggested the disconcordance with treatment guidelines in patients with an acute bipolar depression is common under naturalistic conditions in mainland China, and the predicting factors correlated with guidelines disconcordance include both psychiatrist-specific (clinicians from general hospitals) and patient-specific features (a depressive episode at first onset, no current co-morbidity with mental disorders, a younger age at study entry, an older age at first onset, shorter duration of disease, and non-frequent episodes in past year)."}, {"Title": "Pediatric delirium: evaluating the gold standard.", "Abstract": "Our aim was to evaluate interrater reliability for the diagnosis of pediatric delirium by child psychiatrists.\nCritically ill patients (N = 17), 0-21 years old, including 7 infants, 5 children with developmental delay, and 7 intubated children, were assessed for delirium using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) (comparable to DSM-V) criteria.

The assigned cohorts were neuropathic-related neck/back diagnoses (NEURO); neuropathic and nociceptive neck/back diagnoses (NEURO/NOCI); nociceptive neck/back diagnoses without a neuropathic-related diagnosis (NOCI); and only osteoarthritis (OA) diagnoses. All analyses were conducted by cohort. The analysis included the following patient-descriptive variables: patient demographics, comorbidities, office visits, most frequent medical providers and number of different prescribers, all medications, pain medications as classified by the WHO pain ladder, adjuvant medications, adjuvant procedures and potential drug interactions. The goal for selecting these variables was to describe a range of data that might provide insight into the complexity of pain management decisions faced by clinicians.\nThe study included 85,014 patients, classified as NEURO (n = 2,375), NEURO/NOCI (n = 37,019), NOCI (n = 39,496), and OA (n = 6,124). The most frequently occurring comorbidities (observed in > 40% of patients) included cardiovascular and neuropathic pain conditions. Considering all types of medication claims observed among all cohorts, the overall mean prescription claim count for the 2-year observation period was 57.9 claims (standard deviation 56.2). Weak opioids (WHO pain relief ladder rung 2) accounted for the majority of pain medication claims across all cohorts. Across cohorts, 25.7% of patients had 10 or more days of overlapping drug availability (for inducers or inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 system concomitantly), a measure of potential for drug interactions.\nChoosing the appropriate pain treatment involves assessing currently used medications for existing illnesses and deciding on the appropriate types of pain medications.

In fact, increasing levels of both prescriptions and related fatalities, together with an anecdotally growing black market, have been reported from a range of countries. This article reviews the current evidence base of this potential, in an attempt to answer the question of whether there is cause for concern about these drugs. Potent binding of pregabalin/gabapentin at the calcium channel results in a reduction in the release of excitatory molecules. Furthermore, gabapentinoids are thought to possess GABA-mimetic properties whilst possibly presenting with direct/indirect effects on the dopaminergic 'reward' system. Overall, pregabalin is characterized by higher potency, quicker absorption rates and greater bioavailability levels than gabapentin. Although at therapeutic dosages gabapentinoids may present with low addictive liability levels, misusers' perceptions for these molecules to constitute a valid substitute for most common illicit drugs may be a reason of concern. Gabapentinoid experimenters are profiled here as individuals with a history of recreational polydrug misuse, who self-administer with dosages clearly in excess (e.g. up to 3-20 times) of those that are clinically advisable. Physicians considering prescribing gabapentinoids for neurological/psychiatric disorders should carefully evaluate a possible previous history of drug abuse, whilst being able to promptly identify signs of pregabalin/gabapentin misuse and provide possible assistance in tapering off the medication."}, {"Title": "Fetal exposure to perfluorinated compounds and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in childhood.", "Abstract": "The association between exposure to perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis has been sparsely investigated in humans and the findings are inconsistent.\nA matched case-control study was conducted to investigate the association between fetal exposure to PFCs and ADHD diagnosis in childhood.\nThe study base comprised children born in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, between 1978 and 2000 that were followed up until 2005.

Several studies have already found correlations between trait-impulsivity and externalizing disorders. However, the studies interested in the relationship between trait-impulsivity and internalizing problems are rare. We have tried to explore correlations between impulsivity and externalization and internalization problems, in a population of adolescent outpatients.\nWe recruited 31 adolescent out-patients in the child and adolescent psychiatry department in the University Hospital of Monastir, Tunisia. The Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS) was used to evaluate a multidimensional concept of trait-impulsivity, including the dimensions of \"Motor\", \"Non-planning\" and \"Attentional\" impulsivities. The Strength and Difficulties Scales (SDQ) was used to assess different domains of externalizing and internalizing problems, including \"Emotional symptoms\", \"Conduct problems\", \"Hyperactivity\" and \"Peer problems\".\nThe sex-ratio was 1.21. The mean age was 15.19\u00b11.27 years. All patients but one were attending school. The diagnosis was \"Major Depressive Episode\" in 32% and \"Behavior Disorder\" in 38%. The means of the scores of externalizing and internalizing problems were 9.35\u00b14.41 and 9.65\u00b13.26, respectively. The total score of the BIS was significantly related to both scores of externalizing and internalizing problems. The \"Motor\" impulsivity was specially correlated with the externalizing dimension of the SDQ. The non-planning impulsivity was correlated with both scores of externalizing and internalizing problems, but it was mainly related to internalizing problems. The attentional impulsivity was also correlated with both dimensions of externalizing and internalizing problems.\nThe dimensions of trait-impulsivity were correlated with various dimensions of the SDQ concerning externalizing and internalizing problems. That confirms the hypothesis that the impulsiveness is associated with wide domains of the psychopathology of the teenager which are not limited to behavior disorders.

The reason for this phenomenon is certainly multifactorial, but it has been greatly exacerbated due to the latest financial crisis. The United Kingdom is one of the most popular destinations amongst emigrating Greek psychiatric doctors, as reflected by official data and by the sheer volume of requests for information received by the United Kingdom Division of the Hellenic Psychiatric Association. There are many systemic and practical differences between the Greek and the United Kingdom health systems, which complicate training and further career decisions. These complex differences make it hard for psychiatric doctors to decide which steps to take, and often result in them making the \"wrong\" decision. These \"wrong\" decisions are very often the result of poor information or misinformation. For instance many doctors are confused about the equivalence of training and service grades between Greece and the United Kingdom, what a good portfolio means, or the significance of the MRCPsych exam. This information exists, sometimes in comprehensive ways on the internet, but for doctors who are not familiar with the system, finding this information can be a time-consuming and laborious task.

With the exception of Greece, these countries are new democracies, with their mental health services in a transitional stage of organization. Overall, they have initiated programmes to move psychiatric care towards deinstitutionalization, developing outpatient infrastructures to handle psychiatric disorders. Child psychiatry as a specialization is still less developed than adult psychiatry at a significant, albeit different degree among these countries. The number of mental health services offered to children and adolescents is deemed insufficient, and the type of services limited and lacking. This situation is also reflected in the small number of child psychiatrists and other mental health specialists for children and adolescents, as well as in the complete lack (Montenegro) or deficiency of special programmes and actions for children and adolescents. The same also applies to mental health legislation. Greece is the exception in the development of the entire spectrum of services, the number of specialists, and the establishment of an adequate legislation framework reinforced by the incorporation of all international treaties on children's rights; although the recent economic crisis has affected the country negatively, threatening with regression to pre-reformational practices. Children and adolescents in need of mental health care have been increasing in all countries. The effect of violent and sudden changes taking place in most countries is a major factor for the emergence of increased and stress-related psychopathology and psychosocial problems in children and families. In all countries, there is a significant development of nongovernmental organizations undertaking a large part of reformation work. There is also the disconcerting phenomenon of professional exhaustion and the migration of experts from their countries. Finally, there is the common need to develop educational programmes and related clinical practices in all degrees of prevention, promoting interdisciplinary cooperation, the biopsychosocial approach to understanding and dealing with mental health issues, as well as the development of cooperation among all institutions concerning children (education, health, etc.). All this should be reflected in a national plan to promote child mental health as the foundation upon which the necessary cooperation among Balkan countries would be established in order to promote research, the exchange of experiences, common practices, mutual understanding, and common interests."}, {"Title": "Cognitive impairments and psychopathological parameters in patients of the schizophrenic spectrum.", "Abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia and it is considered by many researchers as one of the dimensional components of the disorder. Cognitive dysfunction occurs in 85% of schizophrenic patients and it is negatively associated with the outcome of the disorder, the psychosocial functioning of the patients, and non-compliance with treatment. Many different cognitive domains are impaired in schizophrenia, such as attention, memory, executive functions and speech. Nowadays, it is argued that apart from clinical heterogeneity of schizophrenia, there is probable heterogeneity in the accompanying neurocognitive dysfunction. Recent studies for cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia employ computerized assessment batteries of cognitive tests, designed to assess specific cognitive impairments. Computerized cognitive testing permits for more detailed data collection (e.g. precise timing scores of responses), eliminates researcher's measurement errors and bias, assists the manipulation of data collected, and improves reliability of measurements through standardized data collection methods. The aims of the present study are: the comparison of cognitive performance of our sample of patients and that of healthy controls, on different specific cognitive tests, and the testing for possible association between patients' psychopathological symptoms and specific cognitive impairments, using the Cogtest computerized cognitive assessment battery. 71 male inpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia or other psychotic spectrum disorders (mean = 30.23 \u00b1 7.71 years of age), admitted in a psychiatric unit of the First Department of Psychiatry, Athens University Medical School, Eginition Hospital (continuous admissions) were studied. Patients were excluded from the study if they suffered from severe neurological conditions, severe visual or hearing impairment, mental retardation, or if they abused alcohol or drugs.

Our findings are that, despite many similarities, the UK guidelines are generally more conservative in their recommendations for medication use, especially for children experiencing only moderate impairment. Our article also compares prescription and diagnosis rates in the UK and the US, and reports evidence for lower rates of prescribing in the UK, despite some evidence that the rates of problems may not differ substantially. We conclude by noting that the existence of an alternative standard provides validation for clinicians or families who prefer to take a more conservative approach to medication use. The two different approaches to care also provide a valuable opportunity for research to determine whether the approaches result in different treatment outcomes."}, {"Title": "Facility characteristics and quality of lung cancer care in an integrated health care system.", "Abstract": "In a national, integrated health care system, we sought to identify facility-level attributes associated with better quality of lung cancer care.\nAdherence to 23 quality indicators across four domains (Diagnosis and Staging, Treatment, Supportive Care, End-of-Life Care) was assessed through abstraction of electronic records from 4804 lung cancer patients diagnosed in 2007 at 131 Veterans Health Administration facilities. Performance was reported as proportions of eligible patients fulfilling adherence criteria. With stratification of patients by stage, generalized estimating equations identified facility-level characteristics associated with performance by domain.\nOverall performance was high for the older (mean age 67.7 years, SD 9.4 years), predominantly male (98%) veterans. However, no facility did well on every measure, and range of adherence across facilities was large; 9% of facilities were in the highest quartile for one or more domain of care, more than 30% for two, and 65% for three. No facility performed consistently well across all domains. Less than 1% performed in the lowest quartile for all. Few facility-level characteristics were associated with care quality. For End-of-Life Care, diagnosis and treatment within the same facility, availability of cancer psychiatry/psychology consultation services, and availability of both inpatient and outpatient palliative care consultation services were associated with better adherence.\nQuality of Veterans Health Administration lung cancer care is generally high, though substantial variation exists across facilities. With the exception of the salutary impact of palliative care consultation services on end-of-life quality of care, observed facility-level characteristics did not consistently predict adherence to indicators, suggesting quality may be determined by complex local factors that are difficult to measure."}, {"Title": "The psychogeriatric patient in the emergency room: focus on management and disposition.", "Abstract": "Background. The growing geriatric population in the United States (US) has prompted better understanding of treatment of the elderly in the hospital and emergency room (ER) settings. This study examines factors influencing the disposition of psychogeriatric patients after their initial presentation in the ER. Methods. Data was collected on patients 65 years of age or older arriving at the ER of a large urban hospital in the USA (January 2009-December 2010). Results. Of the total subjects (n = 95) included in the study, majority were females (66.3%) with an average age of 75.5 years. The chief complaint for psychogeriatric patients coming to the ER was delirium (61.6%). Caucasians were significantly more likely than African-American patients to get a psychiatric consult (33% versus 9%). Patients with delirium were less likely than patients with other psychiatric complaints to get a psychiatric consult in the ER (1.2% versus 47.2%) and less likely to be referred to a psychiatric inpatient unit compared to patients with other psychiatric complaints (2.4% versus 16.7%). Conclusion. Even though delirium is the most common reason for ER visits among psychogeriatric patients, very few delirium patients got a psychiatric consultation in the ER. A well-equipped geriatric psychiatry unit can manage delirium and associated causes."}, {"Title": "Henri Laborit and the inhibition of action.", "Abstract": "Henri Laborit was one of the founders of modern neuropsychopharmacology, having discovered, or participated in, the discovery of chlorpromazine, gamma-OH, clomethiazole, and minaprine.

It has been suggested that large studies of biomarkers across diagnostic entities may yield improved clinical information. Such a view is based on the concept of assessment as a collection of symptoms devoid of any clinical judgment and interpretation. Yet, important advances have been made in recent years in clinimetrics, the science of clinical judgment. The current clinical taxonomy in psychiatry, which emphasizes reliability at the cost of clinical validity, does not include effects of comorbid conditions, timing of phenomena, rate of progression of an illness, responses to previous treatments, and other clinical distinctions that demarcate major prognostic and therapeutic differences among patients who otherwise seem to be deceptively similar since they share the same psychiatric diagnosis. Clinimetrics may provide the missing link between clinical states and biomarkers in psychiatry, building pathophysiological bridges from clinical manifestations to their neurobiological counterparts."}, {"Title": "Problem-Solving Therapy in the Elderly.", "Abstract": "We systematically reviewed randomized clinical trials of problem-solving therapy (PST) in older adults. Our results indicate that PST led to greater reduction in depressive symptoms of late-life major depression than supportive therapy (ST) and reminiscence therapy. PST resulted in reductions in depression comparable with those of paroxetine and placebo in patients with minor depression and dysthymia, although paroxetine led to greater reductions than placebo. In home health care, PST was more effective than usual care in reducing symptoms of depression in undiagnosed patients. PST reduced disability more than ST in patients with major depression and executive dysfunction. Preliminary data suggest that a home-delivered adaptation of PST that includes environmental adaptations and caregiver involvement is efficacious in reducing disability in depressed patients with advanced cognitive impairment or early dementia. In patients with macular degeneration, PST led to improvement in vision-related disability comparable to that of ST, but PST led to greater improvement in measures of vision-related quality of life. Among stroke patients, PST participants were less likely to develop a major or minor depressive episode than those receiving placebo treatment, although the results were not sustained in a more conservative statistical analysis. Among patients with macular degeneration, PST participants had significantly lower 2-month incidence rates of major depression than usual care participants and were less likely to suffer persistent depression at 6 months. Finally, among stroke patients, PST participants were less likely to develop apathy than those receiving placebo treatment. PST also has been delivered via phone, Internet, and videophone, and there is evidence of feasibility and acceptability. Further, preliminary data indicate that PST delivered through the Internet resulted in a reduction in depression comparable with that of in-person PST in home-care patients. PST delivered via videophone results in an improvement in hospice caregivers' quality of life and a reduction in anxiety comparable to those of in-person PST. PST-treated patients with cognitive impairment may require additional compensatory strategies, such as written notes, memory devices, environmental adaptations, and caregiver involvement."}, {"Title": "Focusing on Cause or Cure?: Priorities and Stakeholder Presence in Childhood Psychiatry Research.", "Abstract": "Biomedical research is influenced by many factors, including the involvement of stakeholder groups invested in research outcomes. Stakeholder involvement in research efforts raise questions of justice as their specific interests and motivations play a role in directing research resources that ultimately produce knowledge shaping how different conditions (and affected individuals) are understood and treated by society. This issue is highly relevant to child psychiatry research where diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies are often controversial. Biological similarities and stakeholder differences between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) provide an opportunity to explore this issue by comparing research foci and stakeholder involvement in these conditions.\nA subset of ADHD and ASD research articles published between 1970-2010 were randomly selected from the PubMed database and coded for research focus, funding source(s), and author-reported conflicts of interest (COIs). Chi-square analyses were performed to identify differences between and within ADHD and ASD research across time.\nThe proportion of ADHD research dedicated to basic, description, and treatment research was roughly similar and remained stable over time, while ASD research showed a significant increase in basic research over the past decade. Government was the primary research funder for both conditions, but for-profit funders were a notable presence in ADHD research, while joint-funding efforts between non-profit and government funders were a notable presence in ASD research. Lastly, COIs were noted more frequently in ADHD than in ASD research.\nOur study shows significant differences in research foci and funding sources between the conditions, and identifies the specific involvement of for-profit and non-profit groups in ADHD and ASD, respectively. Our findings highlight the relationship between stakeholders outside the research community and research trajectories and suggest that examinations of these relationships must be included in broader considerations of biomedical research ethics."}, {"Title": "[Trauma and stressor-related disorders: diagnostic conceptualization in DSM-5].", "Abstract": "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5) includes a distinct diagnostic group of trauma and stressor-related disorders that has been set apart from anxiety disorders. From a perspective of adult psychiatry this new disorder category includes posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder (ASD), and adjustment disorders. The PTSD is based on narrower trauma criteria that focus on acute life-threatening situations, serious injury, or sexual violence by way of direct confrontation, witnessing or indirect confrontation. Indirect confrontation, however, is reserved only for violent or accidental events that occurred to close family members or friends. The former A2 criterion of an intense emotional reaction to trauma has been removed. A deliberately broad approach to clinical PTSD phenomenology has created an empirically driven new cluster of persistent negative alterations in cognition and mood due to experiencing traumatic events. The ASD has been reconceptualized as an intense stress syndrome with a clear need of acute treatment during the early course after traumatic exposure. Adjustment disorders continue to emphasize maladaptive emotional and behavioral responses to unspecific, non-traumatic stressors in an intensity that is beyond social or cultural norms. Neither complex PTSD nor prolonged grief disorders have received an independent diagnostic status within DSM-5. With respect to stress-related disorders major divergences between DSM-5 and the future International Classification of Diseases 11 (ICD-11) are to be expected."}, {"Title": "Relationship between SWAP-200 patient personality characteristics and patient-rated alliance early in treatment.", "Abstract": "Research on the therapeutic alliance suggests patient personality characteristics to be plausible correlates of alliance formation.

During each session, the therapist recorded information on anxiety symptoms using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7) and depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Waiting times, type of referrals and reliable recovery rates were investigated.\nOlder adults accounted for only 4% of all the IAPT referrals made between September 2008 and July 2010 in the Eastern Region. Waiting times for both IAPT assessment and treatment were slightly lower for older adult. In all centres, reliable recovery rates were higher in older adults compared to younger adults post-treatment, however these differences were not significant, with the exception of a difference in anxiety scores (\u03c7(2)(1)\u00a0=\u00a018.6, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Most studies were descriptive (60%), focused on adults of working age (60%) and were performed in Northwest Europe-primarily in the UK (32%), Finland (8%), Sweden (8%) and Germany (7%). In terms of mental health characteristics, the largest proportion of studies investigated general mental health (20%), common mental disorders (16%), schizophrenia (16%) or depression (14%). There is a paucity of research looking at mechanisms to reduce stigma and promote social inclusion, or at factors that might promote resilience or protect against stigma/social exclusion across the life course. Evidence is also limited in relation to evaluations of interventions.

The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Extended (BPRS-E) is a widely used scale for assessing psychiatric symptoms, with a stable factor structure over various patient groups. For the first time, its usefulness for forensic psychiatric patients was studied by means of an exploratory factor analysis on 302 patients in a penitentiary psychiatric center. A five-factor solution fitted the data best and showed large overlap with previous research done in both in- and outpatient populations with schizophrenia and mixed diagnoses. Around 45% of the patients did not fully comply. Items relying most on self-report caused the most non-adherence, possibly because of difficulty with verbalizing distress.

Once considered a rare and serious mental disorder, bipolar disorder is being diagnosed with increasing frequency in Europe and North America, and is suggested to replace many other diagnoses. The current article shows how the modern concept of bipolar disorder has been created in the course of efforts to market new antipsychotics and other drugs for bipolar disorder, to enable these drugs to migrate out of the arena of serious mental disorder and into the more profitable realm of everyday emotional problems. A new and flexible notion of the condition has been created that bears little resemblance to the classical condition, and that can easily be applied to ordinary variations in temperament. The assertion that bipolar disorder is a brain disease arising from a biochemical imbalance helps justify this expansion by portraying drug treatment as targeted and specific, and by diverting attention from the adverse effects and mind-altering properties of the drugs themselves. Childhood behavioural problems have also been metamorphosed into \"paediatric bipolar disorder,\" under the leadership of academic psychiatry, with the assistance of drug company financing. The expansion of bipolar disorder, like depression before it, medicalises personal and social difficulties, and profoundly affects the way people in Western nations conceive of what it means to be human."}, {"Title": "Computational approaches to psychiatry.", "Abstract": "A major reason for disappointing progress of psychiatric diagnostics and nosology is the lack of tests which enable mechanistic inference on disease processes within individual patients. The resulting inability to pursue formal differential diagnosis has forced the field to stick to symptom-based diagnostic schemes with limited predictive validity concerning treatment response and clinical outcome. A promising new approach is the use of computational modeling for inferring mechanisms which generate observed behavior and brain activity in psychiatric patients. However, while this computational approach to psychiatry is rapidly gaining attention, much work remains to be done to finesse existing computational models, making them 'fit for practice' in a clinical setting and proving their validity in longitudinal studies. This review outlines recent methodological advances and strategies in this regard, focusing on generative models which infer mechanistically interpretable parameters (of computational or physiological processes) from measured behavior and brain activity."}, {"Title": "Demand and characteristics of a psychiatric 24-hour emergency service performed by mandatory rotation of licensed psychiatrists in Swiss primary care.", "Abstract": "To investigate characteristics of and satisfaction with psychiatric 24-hour emergency primary care performed by mandatory rotation of licensed psychiatrists as a viable baseline for possible reorganizational measures.\nThis was a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study (November 2010-April 2011).

The involvement of structures the limbic system, such as the anterior cingulate cortex, the prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala, paves the way for the discovery of the mechanisms underlying depression depression, anxiety, alexithymia, personality traits, and other psychological impairments following the onset of IBD. Psychiatric therapy in IBD patients is almost as important as the gastroenterological approach and consists of pharmacological treatment and psychotherapy. Neither of the available psychiatric treatment methods is considered the golden standard because both methods have side effects, and psychotropic medication can provoke the worsening of IBD symptoms. Thus, both approaches must be applied with awareness of the possibility of side effects. We suggest that psychiatrists and gastroenterologists work together to reach a consensus on IBD therapy to ensure success and to reduce side effects and relapse to the lowest possible rates."}, {"Title": "PAKs inhibitors ameliorate schizophrenia-associated dendritic spine deterioration in vitro and in vivo during late adolescence.", "Abstract": "Drug discovery in psychiatry has been limited to chemical modifications of compounds originally discovered serendipitously. Therefore, more mechanism-oriented strategies of drug discovery for mental disorders are awaited. Schizophrenia is a devastating mental disorder with synaptic disconnectivity involved in its pathophysiology. Reduction in the dendritic spine density is a major alteration that has been reproducibly reported in the cerebral cortex of patients with schizophrenia. Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1), a factor that influences endophenotypes underlying schizophrenia and several other neuropsychiatric disorders, has a regulatory role in the postsynaptic density in association with the NMDA-type glutamate receptor, Kalirin-7, and Rac1. Prolonged knockdown of DISC1 leads to synaptic deterioration, reminiscent of the synaptic pathology of schizophrenia. Thus, we tested the effects of novel inhibitors to p21-activated kinases (PAKs), major targets of Rac1, on synaptic deterioration elicited by knockdown expression of DISC1. These compounds not only significantly ameliorated the synaptic deterioration triggered by DISC1 knockdown but also partially reversed the size of deteriorated synapses in culture. One of these PAK inhibitors prevented progressive synaptic deterioration in adolescence as shown by in vivo two-photon imaging and ameliorated a behavioral deficit in prepulse inhibition in adulthood in a DISC1 knockdown mouse model. The efficacy of PAK inhibitors may have implications in drug discovery for schizophrenia and related neuropsychiatric disorders in general."}, {"Title": "Involuntary detention: comparison of clinical practices of psychiatry residents and faculty.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study is to study if involuntary detention criteria in legal certificates filed by psychiatry residents and faculty psychiatrists are consistent with observations in clinical documentation.\nEighty-nine involuntarily hospitalized patients were retrospectively selected from medical records; eight patients were excluded due to change in involuntary status or immediate discharge on clinical grounds.

I meditated on this for a long while: It is interesting that Freud--whose wife was a bat kohen, daughter of a priest/rabbi--and Jung, the son and grandson of Protestant Christian ministers, would have such a soteriological dialog at the beginning of the psychoanalytic era. This remark on love was not just a one-off observation, either. The minutes of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society affirm this line of thinking: \"Our cures are cures of love\" (Haynal, 1994, p. 24). Clearly, Freud and his contemporaries were talking about agape, the kind of love God has for humanity, not eros, a physical desire for another person. There is much written in contemporary psychiatric literature about fears of boundary crossing in mental health (Gabbard, 1995 ); Jung's documented erotic relationship with medical student and patient, Sabina Spielrein, may be the causa causans of this concern. But, these fears--correct concerns about untoward involvement in sexual relationships with patients--have obscured the real importance of what Freud and Jung were talking about back in the beginning of their movement. More than 100 years later, it may well be time to revisit the early dialogue of the founders of psychoanalysis and hear them in their own words once again."}, {"Title": "Perinatal mental health - identifying problems and managing medications.", "Abstract": "Perinatal psychiatry has expanded from the traditional focus on mental health in the postpartum period to include a greater understanding that women may become unwell during pregnancy and that the risks to the infant from exposure to illness start before birth. One of the key roles for the general practitioner is to help women with known mental health issues to prepare for pregnancy, as well as identify those at risk and help to guide management choices.\nThis article reviews the issues to consider when managing perinatal illness, focusing on medication.\nPerinatal mental illness is common. The illness poses a risk to mother and child through treating and not treating. The aim is to identify risks early, manage them assertively but sensitively, and ensure that the mother is as well as possible while minimising risk to the child."}, {"Title": "Complementary psychosocial interventions in child and adolescent psychiatry: pet assisted therapy.", "Abstract": "Pet assisted therapy (PAT) is a form of complementary psychosocial intervention used in the field of mental health and disability.

The current study investigated occupational status in adult ADHD patients before and after long-term CS treatment (median duration of treatment 33 months) and aimed to identify variables associated with improvement in occupational status. The collection of data was based on a naturalistic, retrospective approach using the medical records of a sample of all 117 adult ADHD patients consecutively starting treatment with CS in a specific catchment area in Norway in the period 1997 to May 2005. Most patients did not improve in occupational status during long-term CS treatment. The improved group had significantly higher baseline ADHD symptoms as measured by the general adult ADD symptom checklist (83.7 vs. 76.2, p=0.024) and had a significantly shorter period from the first contact with adult psychiatry until they got the ADHD diagnosis (11.7 vs. 50.9 months, p=0.001). The results indicate that long-term CS treatment itself may have limited effect on occupational status in functionally impaired and highly comorbid patients with adult ADHD. A high baseline ADHD symptom level may be related to a superior outcome in occupational status."}, {"Title": "Deep pharma: psychiatry, anthropology, and pharmaceutical detox.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric medication, or psychotropics, are increasingly prescribed for people of all ages by both psychiatry and primary care doctors for a multitude of mental health and/or behavioral disorders, creating a sharp rise in polypharmacy (i.e., multiple medications). This paper explores the clinical reality of modern psychotropy at the level of the prescribing doctor and clinical exchanges with patients. Part I, Geographies of High Prescribing, documents the types of factors (pharmaceutical-promotional, historical, cultural, etc.) that can shape specific psychotropic landscapes. Ethnographic attention is focused on high prescribing in Japan in the 1990s and more recently in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, in the US. These examples help to identify factors that have converged over time to produce specific kinds of branded psychotropic profiles in specific locales. Part II, Pharmaceutical Detox, explores a new kind of clinical work being carried out by pharmaceutically conscious doctors, which reduces the number of medications being prescribed to patients while re-diagnosing their mental illnesses. A high-prescribing psychiatrist in southeast Wisconsin is highlighted to illustrate a kind of med-checking taking place at the level of individual patients. These various examples and cases call for a renewed emphasis by anthropology to critically examine the \"total efficacies\" of modern pharmaceuticals and to continue to disaggregate mental illness categories in the Boasian tradition. This type of detox will require a holistic approach, incorporating emergent fields such as neuroanthropology and other kinds of creative collaborations."}, {"Title": "Posttraumatic stress in emergency settings outside North America and Europe: a review of the emic literature.", "Abstract": "Mental health professionals from North America and Europe have become common participants in postconflict and disaster relief efforts outside of North America and Europe. Consistent with their training, these practitioners focus primarily on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as their primary diagnostic concern. Most research that has accompanied humanitarian aid efforts has likewise originated in North America and Europe, has focused on PTSD, and in turn has reinforced practitioners' assumptions about the universality of the diagnosis. In contrast, studies that have attempted to identify how local populations conceptualize posttrauma reactions portray a wide range of psychological states. We review this emic literature in order to examine differences and commonalities across local posttraumatic cultural concepts of distress (CCDs). We focus on symptoms to describe these constructs - i.e., using the dominant neo-Kraepelinian approach used in North American and European psychiatry - as opposed to focusing on explanatory models in order to examine whether positive comparisons of PTSD to CCDs meet criteria for face validity. Hierarchical clustering (Ward's method) of symptoms within CCDs provides a portrait of the emic literature characterized by traumatic multifinality with several common themes. Global variety within the literature suggests that few disaster-affected populations have mental health nosologies that include PTSD-like syndromes. One reason for this seems to be the almost complete absence of avoidance as pathology. Many nosologies contain depression-like disorders. Relief efforts would benefit from mental health practitioners getting specific training in culture-bound posttrauma constructs when entering settings beyond the boundaries of the culture of their training and practice."}, {"Title": "Walther Birkmayer, Co-describer of L-Dopa, and his Nazi connections: victim or perpetrator?", "Abstract": "Walther Birkmayer, an Austrian neurologist, codiscovered the efficacy of levodopa therapy for Parkinsonism in 1961.

From the early years of the twentieth century, Turkish psychiatrists discussed and interpreted the causes of GPI and followed the European diagnostic and treatment methods of the disease. Austrian psychiatrist Julius Wagner-Jauregg (1857-1940) introduced and developed \"malaria fever therapy\" for general paralysis in 1917. Malaria fever therapy spread to other countries and, during the 1920s, the treatment was also used in Turkey. This article not only aims to illuminate an unnoticed aspect of the history of psychiatry in Turkey but also uses GPI as a model to illustrate how psychiatry in Turkey was influenced by the developments in Europe."}, {"Title": "Does fatigue occur in MS patients without disability?", "Abstract": "Motor dysfunction and fatigue are the most common impairments that are associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Walk tests and scales demonstrate the presence of fatigue in patients with MS with different levels of disability.\nTo evaluate objective and subjective fatigue in MS patients without disability.\nWere selected MS patients with relapsing remitting clinical course, from 18 to 55 years old and EDSS 0 to 1.5; controls were paired for age, gender, body mass index, and physical activity level. Fatigue caused by pulmonary diseases, anemia, diabetes, thyroid disease, psychiatry diseases (except depression), and orthopedic and rheumatologic diseases are excluded. All participants performed the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), the MS Functional Composite (MSFC), and completed the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and the Beck Depression Inventory. A multivariate model was applied to identify the variables associated with fatigue.\n54 individuals were selected (31 patients; 23 controls). In the MSFC and 6MWT, no significant difference was observed between the groups. A MFIS total score indicated fatigue in 35% of the patients, 42% in the physical domain, 25.8% in the cognitive domain, and 29% in the psychosocial domain, which differed from the controls in all comparisons. Fatigue was associated with MS, low-physical activity, and mood disorders.\nFatigue occurs in patients with MS in the absence of motor dysfunction and is associated with the disease itself, the sedentary lifestyle, and mood disorders.

It is important to ensure that data collected is meaningful and accurate and reflects the diverse roles of mental health clinicians, including in CL. Inpatient and community services should be integrated in the model, as well as safeguards against potential abuse.

Four interrelated themes of environmental qualities emerged as central in promoting healing: therapeutic, supportive of functional independence, facilitative of social connections, and personal safety and security. Therapeutic describes the existence of a home-like environment and quality sensory stimulations. Supportive of functional independence refers to the environmental features that make it easy for older adults to mobilize and perform activities of daily living. Facilitative of social connections indicates the provision of social spaces for patients, families, and staff to interact and engage in meaningful activities. Personal safety and security involves having staff in close proximity and minimizing disruptions from confused patients. The evidence suggests that the physical environment is important in making hospitals safe and supportive of healing for older adults with mental health conditions."}, {"Title": "Resource-oriented therapeutic models in psychiatry: conceptual review.", "Abstract": "Like other medical specialties, psychiatry has traditionally sought to develop treatments targeted at ameliorating a deficit of the patient. However, there are different therapeutic models that focus on utilising patients' personal and social resources instead of ameliorating presumed deficits. A synopsis of such models might help to guide further research and improve therapeutic interventions.\nTo conduct a conceptual review of resource-oriented therapeutic models in psychiatry, in order to identify their shared characteristics.\nThe literature was searched to identify a range of resource-oriented therapeutic models, particularly for patients with severe mental illness. Key texts for each model were analysed using a narrative approach to synthesise the concepts and their characteristics.\nTen models were included: befriending, client-centred therapy, creative music therapy, open dialogue, peer support workers, positive psychotherapy, self-help groups, solution-focused therapy, systemic family therapy and therapeutic communities. Six types of resources were utilised: social relationships, patients' decision-making ability, experiential knowledge, patients' individual strengths, recreational activities and self-actualising tendencies. Social relationships are a key resource in all the models, including relationships with professionals, peers, friends and family. Two relationship dimensions - reciprocity and expertise - differed across the models.\nThe review suggests that a range of different therapeutic models in psychiatry address resources rather than deficits. In various ways, they all utilise social relationships to induce therapeutic change. A better understanding of how social relationships affect mental health may inform the development and application of resource-oriented approaches."}, {"Title": "A nationwide study of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder drug use among adults in Iceland 2003-2012.", "Abstract": "In this study, we leveraged on complete nationwide prescription data for the total adult population in Iceland (N\u00a0=\u00a0227,000) to examine how attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) drugs have been used over the past decade. In particular, we aimed to describe the prevalence, incidence and duration of use of stimulants and atomoxetine, among adults (\u226519\u00a0years) in Iceland, with regard to sex, age, type of drug and specialty of the prescribing physician. Our results indicate that the 1-year period prevalence of ADHD drug use rose, from 2.9 to 12.2 per 1000 adults between 2003 and 2012, with the most pronounced increases among young adults (19-24\u00a0years). The annual incidence increased 3 times, similarly among men and women. Extended-release methylphenidate formulations were the most commonly used ADHD drugs. Specialists in psychiatry initiated treatment in 79% of new adult ADHD drug users. The proportion of users still receiving treatment after 1\u00a0year varied from 43.0% (19-24\u00a0years), 57.2% (25-49\u00a0years) to 47.5% (50+ years).

Comparisons (ANOVA with post hoc Tukey tests) were carried out among five groups (n = 417): baseline (freshmen), pre-intervention group (second-year students attending the first day of the course), immediate tested group (second-year students on the final day of the course), 1-year delayed tested group (third-year students), and 3-years delayed tested group (interns).\nIn comparison to the baseline and pre-intervention groups, the other three groups that received teaching displayed significantly better levels of knowledge (p < 0.0001). Differently, scores of interest and attributed importance were higher in the pre-intervention group relative to all other groups that were tested after having been given the course (p < 0.005). There were no significant associations between knowledge retention, attributed importance, and interest within pre-intervention or post-intervention groups.\nThe only modest loss of knowledge over time indicates that a large proportion of early taught content is retained throughout the later years of medical education. Nevertheless, retained knowledge does not seem to be associated with subjective interest and attributed importance to such early taught content."}, {"Title": "Communicating a schizophrenia diagnosis to patients and families: a qualitative study of mental health clinicians.", "Abstract": "The aim of this research was to explore mental health clinicians' experiences and perceptions of discussing a diagnosis of schizophrenia with their patients.

Schema Therapy (ST) is a psychotherapeutic approach that has shown efficacy in patients with borderline personality disorder. ST has recently been adapted for personality disordered forensic patients, including patients with high levels of psychopathy. The present case study examined the process of individual ST, combined with movement therapy and milieu therapy by the nursing staff, with a forensic inpatient with psychopathic features (Psychopathy Checklist-Revised total score = 28.4). The patient had been sentenced to a mandatory treatment order in relation to a sexual assault. We assessed change using independent assessments of psychopathic traits, cognitive schemas, and risk-related behaviors over the 4-year treatment period and a 3-year follow-up. We also assessed the quality of the working alliance. Reliable change analyses showed significant improvements in psychopathic traits, cognitive schemas, and risk-related outcomes.

This question of causation is most directly addressable in genetically tractable model organisms, including invertebrates such as Drosophila. Yet there is ongoing debate about whether such species even have \"emotions,\" as emotions are typically defined with reference to human behavior and neuroanatomy. Here, we argue that emotional behaviors are a class of behaviors that express internal emotion states. These emotion states exhibit certain general functional and adaptive properties that apply across any specific human emotions like fear or anger, as well as across phylogeny. These general properties, which can be thought of as \"emotion primitives,\" can be modeled and studied in evolutionarily distant model organisms, allowing functional dissection of their mechanistic bases and tests of their causal relationships to behavior. More generally, our approach not only aims at better integration of such studies in model organisms with studies of emotion in humans, but also suggests a revision of how emotion should be operationalized within psychology and psychiatry."}, {"Title": "BARRIERS AND CONTRIBUTORS TO SUCCESS IN TELEMEDICINE: A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF A STRUGGLING TELEPSYCHIATRY PROJECT AND A SAMPLING OF HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMMES.", "Abstract": "Telemedicine programmes, though popular and increasingly effective, can sometimes fail with little indication as to why they did so.

Overall, 1060 out of all employees (N\u2009=\u20091279) from a manufacturing company in Japan responded to two web-based surveys of depression of the WHO-CIDI within a one-year interval in 2009 and 2010. The concordance between lifetime diagnoses of major depressive disorder on two occasions was calculated as percent agreement (%), Gwet's AC1 , and Yule's Q indicators were compared by gender, age, education, and marital status. For the total sample, percent agreement was 94%, AC1 was 0.93, and Yule's Q was 0.82. The concordance rate was low (0.15) among those who were diagnosed at either time or both times. The concordance differed significantly across education and marital status. While the agreement indicators were relatively high, consistent with previous reports based on face-to-face interviews conducted within a shorter interval, the low stability of positive cases may challenge the accuracy of lifetime diagnosis of major depressive disorder using a web version of the WHO-CIDI.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk perception of psychotropic drug use in pregnancy among physicians in different medical specialties.\nThis was a convenience survey conducted at outpatient clinics in the cities of Recife, Brazil, and La Plata, Bah\u00eda Blanca, and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Physicians who agreed to participate were asked to rate their perception of teratogenic risk among different classes of drugs, which included antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines.\nTwo hundred and thirty-eight physicians completed the survey (response rate, 98%). These included psychiatrists, obstetricians, neurologists, cardiologists, gastroenterologists, and general practitioners. Among different specialties, a minority of psychiatrists perceived psychotropic drugs to be highly teratogenic (antidepressants, 12.5%; antipsychotics, 15%; benzodiazepines, 25%) as compared with other specialties (p < 0.003 for each drug class). There was no difference in perceived risk of antiepileptic drugs among specialties, including psychiatrists.\nThe risk associated with use of psychotropic drugs in pregnancy was overestimated by physicians of all medical specialties, except psychiatry.

Patterns of growth among children of women reporting a history of AN (n=137), BN (n=165), both AN and BN (n=68) and other psychiatric disorders (n=920) were compared with an unexposed group of children (n=8900).\nHeight and weight data, from birth to 10 years, were extracted from health visitor records, parental report from questionnaires and clinic attendances. Growth trajectories were analysed using mixed-effects models and constructed separately for male and female children.\nBetween birth and 10 years, male children of women with BN were taller than children in the unexposed group. Male children of women with a history of AN and BN, and female children of women with AN, were shorter throughout childhood. Between the ages of 2 and 5, higher body mass index (BMI) was observed in male children in all maternal ED groups. Conversely, female children of women with AN had a BMI of -0.35 kg/m(2) lower at 2 years compared with the unexposed group, with catch-up by age 10.\nEarly childhood growth has been found to predict weight gain in adolescence and adulthood, and may be a risk factor for the development of an ED.

The tendency of today's psychiatry is to attribute the psychotic process to alteration in the brain's anatomy, biochemistry and electrophysiology, thus exempting the subject, i.e. the afflicted person, from responsibility for attachment to reality and their sanity. Jung understood schizophrenia as an 'abaissement du niveau mental', a similar phenomenon to the one encountered in dreams, and caused by a peculiar 'faiblesse de la volont\u00e9'. He contested that complexes in schizophrenia, in contrast with neurotic disorders, are disconnected and can either never reintegrate to the psychic totality or can only join together in remission 'like a mirror broke into splinters' (Jung , para. 507). Accordingly, a person who does not fight for the supremacy of ego consciousness and has let themself be swayed by the intrusion of alien contents arising from the unconscious (even to the point of becoming fascinated by regression) is exposed to the danger of schizophrenia. The contemporary relevance of these notions and their necessity in understanding the psychotic process in the light of modern scientific findings are discussed."}, {"Title": "The best-laid plans go oft awry: synaptogenic growth factor signaling in neuropsychiatric disease.", "Abstract": "Growth factors play important roles in synapse formation.

Genetic association studies in humans have found evidence for similar relationships between growth factor signaling pathways and neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Accumulating data suggest that dysfunction in neuronal circuitry, caused by defects in growth factor-mediated synapse formation, contributes to the susceptibility to multiple neuropsychiatric diseases, including epilepsy, autism, and disorders of thought and mood (e.g., schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, respectively).

Thus there is a growing need for interventions that facilitate motor learning during rehabilitation therapy, to optimize recovery. d-Cycloserine (DCS), a partial N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist that enhances neurotransmission throughout the central nervous system (Ressler KJ, Rothbaum BO, Tannenbaum L, Anderson P, Graap K, Zimand E, Hodges L, Davis M. Arch Gen Psychiatry 61: 1136-1144, 2004), has been shown to facilitate declarative and emotional learning. We therefore tested whether combining DCS with motor training facilitates motor learning after stroke in a series of two experiments. Forty-one healthy adults participated in experiment I, and twenty adults with stroke participated in experiment II of this two-session, double-blind study. Session one consisted of baseline assessment, subject randomization, and oral administration of DCS or placebo (250 mg). Subjects then participated in training on a balancing task, a simulated feeding task, and a cognitive task. Subjects returned 1-3 days later for posttest assessment. We found that all subjects had improved performance from pretest to posttest on the balancing task, the simulated feeding task, and the cognitive task. Subjects who were given DCS before motor training, however, did not show enhanced learning on the balancing task, the simulated feeding task, or the associative recognition task compared with subjects given placebo. Moreover, training on the balancing task did not generalize to a similar, untrained balance task. Our findings suggest that DCS does not enhance motor learning or motor skill generalization in neurologically intact adults or in adults with stroke."}, {"Title": "\"Too Young to be Worried!\" Psychiatric Assessment and Follow-up of Young People After Severe Physical Assault in an Inner City Hospital of South London.", "Abstract": "Interpersonal violence amongst youth is on the rise world-wide and London is no exception.

The prevalence of MetS in schizophrenic subjects was reported to be two times higher than in the general population. The MetS components were higher among schizophrenic patients than healthy subjects. Among the components of MetS, central obesity (63.9%) was the most common criteria among patients compared to healthy subjects (45.7%) (p<0.001). Schizophrenic patients (27%) were significantly obese than the healthy subjects (13.1%). Female schizophrenia patients were more likely to have three or more metabolic abnormalities compared to men.\nThe study indicated that metabolic syndrome was highly prevalent in patients with schizophrenia. The female gender was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome.

This comparison was used to consider the implications for public attitudes which may influence the adoption of public health interventions to reduce homicide. 217 homicides were identified by 105 perpetrators in the television series 'Midsomer Murders' between 1997 and 2011; these were compared to 55 homicides by 53 perpetrators in the regional sample between 2006 and 2011. The numbers of serial killings (p < 0.0001), planned homicides, female perpetrators (p < 0.0001), shootings (p = 0.0456) and poisonings (p = 0.0289) were higher in the fictional sample. Lothian & Borders cases were almost all single killings, mostly unplanned, with a far greater rate of homicide by kitchen knives (p < 0.0001) and hitting/kicking (p = 0.0005) by intoxicated perpetrators. Control of access to pointed kitchen knives by members of certain groups may reduce homicide rates.

The social lens through which women are viewed tends to play down their responsibility in the sexual abuse of children. Unlike men, women rarely abuse children outside the close or family circle. Furthermore, they have frequently been abused themselves in their childhood. To our knowledge, no cases of women charged with sex-related offences, including child pornography, have been described in the literature. The psychopathological characteristics of female sexual abusers and of the two women in our cases tend to suggest that the deliberate downloading of child pornography images by women is unusual, as their deviant behaviour is not related to paedophile sexual arousal It is hypothesized that the act enables women perpetrators to satisfy the sexual urges of their spouse. Sexual abuse by women exists, but the nature of the abuse appears to be specific to the gender of the perpetrator. We present two cases of women charged with sexual offences concerning minors, including the production of child pornography material."}, {"Title": "[Consequences of hospitalisations on smoking behaviour in psychiatric and somatic inpatients].", "Abstract": "To examine the differences and potential changes that occur in smoking habits among psychiatric and somatic patients due to and during their hospital stay in a general hospital.\nInpatients of three departments (psychiatry,cardiology, pulmology) were given a questionnaire that asked for epidemiologic data and their smoking habits,including the Fagerstrom-Test. In order to achieve sufficient data, the questionnaire was administered twice on two different dates. Primary goal of this examination was to determine a potential change in smoking behaviour whereas the secondary goal was to check for differences between psychiatric and somatic inpatients and within the psychiatric diagnostic groups according to their smoking habits respectively. According to a lack of normal distribution of the data non parametric tests undvisual classifying were used for statistical analysis.\nA substantial proportion (26.4 %) of psychiatric inpatients reported an increase in cigarette consumption or have restarted or newly started smoking cigarettes are due to their admission. On the other hand, none of the somatic patients did so, actually they showed higher proportion of being non-smokers. There were statistically significant differences between psychiatric and somatic patients in two age-groups due to their change in smoking habits and severity of nicotine dependence as measured by the Fagerstrom-test. Among the psychiatric patients sampled, those with schizophrenia and affective disorders showed high prevalence of being highly addicted smokers in 85.7 and 44.4 % respectively.\nAs a result of this small sample and hindered comparability of somatic and psychiatric groups of inpatients further investigations are needed to evaluate the influence of hospitalisations on smoking behaviour and to tailor suitable actions"}, {"Title": "Vallejo-N\u00e1gera (1926-1990) and the concept of 'soteric neurosis': a forgotten sketch of hoarding disorder in the obsessive-compulsive spectrum literature.", "Abstract": "Juan Antonio Vallejo-N\u00e1gera, psychiatrist, painter and writer, wrote a widely adopted textbook of psychiatry in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries, particularly during the 1970s, the famous Introducci\u00f3n a la psiquiatr\u00eda.

A well-known example for gene x environment interactions in psychiatry is the low activity (s) allelic variant of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) that in the context of stress increases risk for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previously, we observed robust anxiety-related phenotypes, such as an impairment in fear extinction, in 5-HTT knockout (5-HTT-/-) versus wild-type (5-HTT+/+) rats housed in open cages. Recently, housing conditions were changed from open cages to individually ventilated cages (IVC), which are associated with a high ventilation fold and noise. This switch in housing conditions prompted an unplanned 5-HTT gene x environment interaction study in our rats. The current study shows that lifetime stress by means of IVC cage housing abolished genotype differences in fear extinction between 5-HTT-/- and 5-HTT+/+ rats. Although this effect was not attributed specifically to either the 5-HTT+/+ or the 5-HTT-/- genotype, the findings are in agreement with the modulatory role of serotonin in the processing of environmental stimuli. Our findings also underline the possibility that housing conditions confound the interpretation of anxiety-related behaviours in rodents."}, {"Title": "Effects of life satisfaction and psychache on risk for suicidal behaviour: a cross-sectional study based on data from Chinese undergraduates.", "Abstract": "To examine predictive power of psychache and life satisfaction on risks for suicidal ideation and suicide attempt among young people.\nA cross-sectional study.\nData were collected from an online survey in Wuhan, China.\n5988 university students from six universities were selected by a stratified cluster sampling method.\nSuicidal ideation and suicide attempt at some point of the students' lifetime were the outcomes of interest.\nStudents with suicidal ideation or attempted suicide reported a lower level of life satisfaction and high degree of psychache than counterparts without suicidal ideation or attempt. Regression analyses indicated that life satisfaction and psychache were significantly associated with the risk of suicidal ideation and the risk of suicidal attempt. Though psychache showed a relatively stronger predictive power than life satisfaction, the effect of the two factors remained significant when they were individually adjusted for personal demographic characteristics. However, when the two factors were included in the model simultaneously to adjust for each other, psychache could fully explain the association between life satisfaction and suicidal attempt. Life satisfaction remained to contribute unique variance in the statistical prediction of suicidal ideation.\nPsychache and life satisfaction both have a significant predictive power on risk for suicidal behaviour, and life satisfaction could relieve the predictive power of psychache when suicidal behaviour is just starting. Shneidman's theory that psychache is the pre-eminent psychological cause of suicide is perhaps applicable only to a more serious form of suicidal behaviour."}, {"Title": "Distinguishing borderline personality disorder from adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a clinical and dimensional perspective.", "Abstract": "Adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequently associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD).

Dependent variables were the amount and type of extra information used, time needed and judgments of the severity of symptoms, appropriate treatment and health care providers.\nCompared to psychiatrists, GPs were more reluctant to refer to specialized care, they needed less supplementary information and reached their conclusion in less time. Their processing of information appeared to be more contextual. Psychiatrists used a more stable procedure in which information inspection took place independently of differences in the vignettes.\nGPs and psychiatrists not only give different answers (treatment advices) because they have different expertise, but also because they have different questions due to other roles, and they use different clinical decision procedures.

The 'move into the community' in many countries over recent decades and the evolution of community services have substantially altered the locus of coercion. In many countries psychiatric services remain poorly funded and patchy. Substantial differences between regions and countries in the provision of services, the role of the family, and the wider economic and political climate are likely to lead to different sources and experiences of coercion.\nThis paper explores a number of factors that may affect the prevalence and type of coercion in psychiatric services and in society and their impact upon those with severe mental illnesses. Differences in service provision are explored and wider societal issues that may impact are considered along with relevant evidence.\nCoercion is commonly experienced by those with severe mental illnesses but is poorly understood. The vast majority of research relates to High Income Group countries with developed community services and formal mental health legislation that adopt the so-called 'medical model'. Further research and collaboration is urgently required to increase our understanding of these issues, which are difficult to define and measure. An evidence base that is relevant worldwide, not just to a small group of countries, is needed to inform training and the care of all patients.

These studies indicated that patients with CMT exhibited an increased trend toward depressive symptoms compared with the general population. In addition, CMT patients were exposed to a higher risk of reduced quality of life and significant sleep impairment.

The case underscores the importance of considering that an arachnoid cyst can induce psychopathological symptoms, even those of schizophrenia. Indeed, such symptoms may be the cyst's only clinical manifestation.

In a parallel move, somatic medicine has defined an expanding group of similar pain disorders, known as functional pain syndromes. Functional pain syndromes are characterized by enhanced pain sensitivity. The aim of our study was to investigate the proportion of patients with somatoform pain disorders who also meet the criteria of functional pain syndromes and the extent to which patients with somatoform pain disorders also show enhanced pain sensitivity.\nData on pain sensitivity in 120 hospitalized patients were obtained by means of two algometric methods. The group of patients with somatoform pain disorders was further divided into two subsets: patients with and those without a co-diagnosis of a functional pain syndrome. Patients with nociceptive pain served as control group.\nOf the 120 in-patients selected, 67 fulfilled the criteria of a somatoform pain disorder of which 41 (61%) also met the co-diagnosis of a functional pain syndrome. Patients with somatoform pain disorder differed from controls in that they showed enhanced pain sensitivity, irrespective of whether a functional pain syndrome was concomitantly present (P<.001).\nSomatoform pain disorders show considerable overlap with functional pain syndromes, including enhanced pain sensitivity. This suggests the relevance of integrating somatosensory aspects of pain into a modified understanding of somatoform pain disorders."}, {"Title": "Can individuals with schizophrenia be instructed to deliberately feign memory deficits?", "Abstract": "Neuropsychological tests are increasingly applied in research studies and clinical practice in psychiatry.

In study 1, participants were asked to complete the 21-Item Test to the best of their ability.

The Werner Kalow Responsible Innovation Prize is given to an exceptional interdisciplinary scholar who has made highly innovative and enduring contributions to global omics science and personalized medicine, with both vertical and horizontal (transdisciplinary) impacts. The prize is established in memory of a beloved colleague, mentor, and friend, the late Professor Werner Kalow, who cultivated the idea and practice of pharmacogenetics in modern therapeutics commencing in the 1950s. PRACP, the prize's sponsor, is one of the longest standing learned societies in the Asia-Pacific region, and was founded by Kalow and colleagues more than two decades ago in the then-emerging field of pharmacogenetics. In announcing this inaugural prize and its winner, we seek to highlight the works of prize winner, Professor Lerer. Additionally, we contextualize the significance of the prize by recalling the life and works of Professor Kalow and providing a brief socio-technical history of the rise of pharmacogenetics and personalized medicine as a veritable form of 21(st) century scientific practice. The article also fills a void in previous social science analyses of pharmacogenetics, by bringing to the fore the works of Kalow from 1995 to 2008, when he presciently noted the rise of yet another field of postgenomics inquiry--pharmacoepigenetics--that railed against genetic determinism and underscored the temporal and spatial plasticity of genetic components of drug response, with invention of the repeated drug administration (RDA) method that estimates the dynamic heritabilities of drug response.

Here, we provide evidence of how the effects of oxidative stress on fatty acid (FA) and one-carbon (1-C) cycle metabolism, which may initially represent adaptive responses, might underlie comorbidity between CVD and psychiatric disorders.\nWe conducted a literature search and integrated data in a narrative review.\nOxidative stress, mainly generated in mitochondria, is implicated in both psychiatric and cardiovascular pathophysiology. Oxidative stress affects the intrinsically linked FA and 1-C\u00a0cycle metabolism: FAs decrease in chain length and unsaturation (particularly omega-3 polyunsaturated FAs), and lipid peroxidation products increase; the 1-C cycle shifts from the methylation to transsulfuration pathway (lower folate and higher homocysteine and antioxidant glutathione). Interestingly, corresponding alterations were reported in psychiatric disorders and CVD. Potential mechanisms through which FA and 1-C\u00a0cycle metabolism may be involved in brain (neurocognition, mood regulation) and cardiovascular system functioning (inflammation, thrombosis) include membrane peroxidizability and fluidity, eicosanoid synthesis, neuroprotection and epigenetics.\nWhile oxidative-stress-induced alterations in FA and 1-C metabolism may initially enhance oxidative stress resistance, persisting chronically, they may cause damage possibly underlying (co-occurrence of) psychiatric disorders and CVD.

The disorder is often challenging to diagnose and even more difficult to document in front of the patient or relatives. It represents a challenge for the physician, and any attempt at treatment may be followed by recurrence of the self-mutilation. This paper describes two cases of pathomimia diagnosed by dermatologists and treated in a psychiatry unit, highlighting the importance of collaboration in these situations.\nTwo case reports, describing old female patients with pathomimia, hospitalized in a department of dermatology for bizarre skin lesions.\nThe first case was a 77-year-old female with unknown psychiatric problems and atrophic skin lesions on the face, self-induced for many months, with multiple hospitalizations in dermatology units, with no response to different therapeutic patterns, and full recovery after psychiatric treatment for a major depressive syndrome. The second case was a 61-year-old female patient with disseminated atrophic scars on the face, trunk, and limbs. She raised our interest because of possible psychiatric issues, as she had attempted to commit suicide. The prescription of antidepressants led to a significant clinical improvement.\nThese cases indicate that a real psychiatric disease may be recorded in patients suffering from pathomimia. Therefore, complete psychiatric evaluation in order to choose the proper therapy is mandatory for all these cases. Dermatologists and all physicians who take care of old patients must recognize the disorder in order to provide optimum care for this chronic condition. We emphasize therefore the importance of psychiatric evaluation and treatment to avoid the major risk of suicide.

Successive editions of the dsm have had a major influence on the language of psychiatry. This means that the Dutch translation needs to be of a high standard.\nTo discuss the problems involved in translating the DSM-5 into Dutch.\nBy way of illustration, a number of problems are presented which arose with the translation into Dutch of the American terms for psychiatric disorders in the DSM-III and -IV. In some places this has led to the use of unusual, unfamiliar words and phrases. The translators of the DSM-5 face similar and new dilemmas.\nThe examples demonstrate how important it is to keep as close as possible to the American terminology. In the Dutch version of DSM-5 the translation in many places remains closer to the American original. This means giving careful attention to different shades of meaning, which in turn can give rise to classification problems.\nThe translation of the DSM-5 into Dutch is important. The translation of the title 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)' as 'Handbook voor de classificatie van psychische stoornissen - DSM-5' demonstrates clearly that the dsm-5 is certainly not a 'diagnostic bible'."}, {"Title": "[Structural changes in DSM-5: the beginning of a transformation?].", "Abstract": "The dsm-5 received both praise and criticism following its publication in May 2013. Some blamed the dsm classification system for the unsatisfactory diagnostic system within psychiatry. Over the last 30 years or so there have been no major breakthroughs in our field and there has been no reduction in the number of mental health problems in Western society. It is time for a change; the question is whether DSM-5 will succeed in bringing about this change.\nTo update and analyse the structural, diagnosis-independent changes that have been incorporated in DSM-5.\nWe discuss the changes.\nThe most important structural, diagnosis-independent changes include: 1. the separate classification of disorders that begin in childhood from those that begin in adolescence has been abolished; 2. the multi-axial system has disappeared; 3. the approach has become more dimensional, which allows for the assessment of the severity of a disorder.\nIn the DSM-5 there are clear signs that a transformation of our psychiatric assessment system has begun; this can only be seen as a positive development, but is probably just the tip of the iceberg. Further changes are likely to occur, some in the near future, others in the long term."}, {"Title": "[Trauma history and posttraumatic stress symptoms among children and adolescents attending a mental health service].", "Abstract": "Systematic exploration of potentially traumatic events and posttraumatic stress symptoms of patients attending a hospital for child and adolescent psychiatry and psychotherapy.\nThe UCLA PTSD Reaction Index for DSM-IV was filled in by 413 children and adolescents and 403 caregivers at their first attendance at the clinic.\nAt least one traumatic event was reported by 46.9% of the children and adolescents and/or caregivers.

This behaviour is also common in elderly people with mental illness, but little research has been conducted into this problem in old age psychiatry settings. The attitudes of clinical staff toward aggression may affect the way they manage this behaviour. The purpose of this study was to examine the attitudes of clinical staff toward the causes and management of aggression in acute old age psychiatry inpatient settings.\nA convenience sample of clinical staff were recruited from three locked acute old age psychiatry inpatient units in Melbourne, Australia. They completed the Management of Aggression and Violence Scale, which assessed the causes and managment of aggression in psychiatric settings.\nEighty-five staff completed the questionnaire, comprising registered nurses (61.1%, n = 52), enrolled nurses (27.1%, n = 23) and medical and allied health staff (11.8%, n = 10). A range of causative factors contributed to aggression. The respondents had a tendency to disagree that factors directly related to the patient contributed to this behaviour. They agreed patients were aggressive because of the environment they were in, other people contributed to them becoming aggressive, and patients from certain cultural groups were prone to these behaviours. However, there were mixed views about whether patient aggression could be prevented, and this type of behaviour took place because staff did not listen to patients. There was agreement medication was a valuable approach for the management of aggression, negotiation could be used more effectively in such challenging behaviour, and seclusion and physical restraint were sometimes used more than necessary. However, there was disagreement about whether the practice of secluding patients should be discontinued.\nAggression in acute old age psychiatry inpatient units occurs occasionally and is problematic. A range of causative factors contribute to the onset of this behaviour. Attitudes toward the management of aggression are complex and somewhat contradictory and can affect the way staff manage this behaviour; therefore, wide-ranging initiatives are needed to prevent and deal with this type of challenging behaviour."}, {"Title": "Increasing incidence of Clostridium difficile infection, Australia, 2011-2012.", "Abstract": "To report the quarterly incidence of hospital-identified Clostridium difficile infection (HI-CDI) in Australia, and to estimate the burden ascribed to hospital-associated (HA) and community-associated (CA) infections.\nProspective surveillance of all cases of CDI diagnosed in hospital patients from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2012 in 450 public hospitals in all Australian states and the Australian Capital Territory.

One of the reasons for their admission was to make a differential diagnosis. The diagnoses of fifteen patients (mean age at onset: 29.5 +/- 8.5 years, and mean age at their first visit to a psychiatrist: 34.3 +/- 10.0 years), who had been diagnosed with depression and treated with various kinds of antidepressants for years (mean period: 4.9 +/- 3.4 years) were changed to persistent depression with minute schizophrenia-like symptoms according to \"pluridimensional assessment,\" which takes the following factors into consideration: a premorbid character, predicting situations or life events, clinical features, psychological tests, reactions to treatment, and the course and social outcome. The psychopathology of these fifteen patients was closely investigated.\nThe investigation revealed that: 1) All patients had a premorbid \"schizoid tendency\", which was defined as more than two of three character markers of \"Schizothymie\", described by E. Kretschmer. 2) Most of the patients clinically manifested after low-level psychosocial stress had activated hypersensitivity to the surroundings. 3) In addition to depressive symptoms delineated in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), clinical features included repeated physical complaints, which were poorly explained, suicidal behaviors without any understandable conflicts, unexpected arrogant attitudes toward medical staff and other patients, and superficial, simplistic, and monotonous speech and odd thoughts. They were regarded as minute symptoms of schizophrenia, which should not be overlooked. 4) They showed clear evidence of severe cognitive impairment in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale third edition (WAIS-III) and in the Landscape Montage Technique (LMT). The results of these psychological tests, which should be assessed as reference materials in a clinical diagnosis, were low and bizarre when their premorbid social functioning was considered, which may be concordant with their latest defective social functioning. 5) Pharmacotherapy involving any kind of antidepressant had not been effective, and, in some patients switching to or adding antipsychotic drugs effectively reduced their minute schizophrenia-like symptoms, hypersensitivity, and loss of motivation. 6) Two patients committed suicide, three were demoted from regular to contractual employment, and the others are now undergoing rehabilitation together with schizophrenic patients in regional day-care and occupational therapy centers.\nClinicians should explore the possibility that manifested mood changes conceal minute schizophrenia-like symptoms.

The problem is that such studies have a poor signal-to- noise ratio. In such studies, approximately one third of participants receiving drug respond specifically because of the drug, one third of participants receiving drug respond not because of the drug but rather because of the \"placebo\" effect inherent in participating in such a study, and one third of participants on drug do not respond sufficiently to be counted as responders. In analyzing the results of such studies, the data from these last two groups make it impossible to identify whether there is any relationship between drug concentration and antidepressant response.

This review extends and updates the findings of the prior one based on the previous 15years of research. Studies published since 1999 were identified and coded using standard criteria and effect sizes were calculated where appropriate. Highlights of the last 15years of research include an expansion of pharmacological treatment options and developmentally appropriate psychosocial treatment packages for adolescents with ADHD. Additionally, nonstimulant medications (e.g., atomoxetine) are now approved for the treatment of ADHD in adolescence. The review concludes that medication and BT produce a similar range of therapeutic effects on the symptoms of adolescents with ADHD.

Detailed clinical and administrative information from medical records and written court decisions was gathered retrospectively from admission until discharge for a Swedish population-based, consecutive cohort of forensic psychiatric patients (n=125). The median length of stay for the whole cohort was 951 days, but patients with a restriction order stayed in hospital almost five times as long as patients without. Restriction orders were related to convictions for violent crime, but not for any other differences in demographic or clinical variables. The majority of the patients (60%) were involved in adverse events (violence, threats, substance abuse, or absconding) at some time during their treatment. Patients with restriction orders were overrepresented in violent and threat events. Previous contact with child and adolescence psychiatric services, current violent index crime, psychotic disorders, a history of substance, and absconding during treatment predicted longer length of stay. Being a parent, high current Global Assessment of Functioning scores, and mood disorders were all significantly related to earlier discharge. In a stepwise Cox regression analysis current violent index crime and absconding remained risk factors for a longer hospital stay, while a diagnosis of mood disorder was significantly related to a shorter length of stay."}, {"Title": "The police, social services and psychiatry cooperation in Denmark--a new model of working practice between governmental sectors. A description of the concept, process, practice and experience.", "Abstract": "In 2004 a new model of working practice between three public sectors, the local Police Department, Social Services and Psychiatry/Mental Health Services (PSP) was introduced in the municipality of Frederiksberg, Denmark. The aim of this cooperation was to enhance support to vulnerable citizens, who do not belong solely to one of the three sectors and thereby often get lost in the system. The PSP cooperation was introduced to ensure that relevant information concerning vulnerable citizens was shared between the three sectors and to improve collaboration between the sectors involved in order to provide the needed support to the individual citizen. Due to the success of the PSP cooperation in Frederiksberg, the PSP model was implemented by law in Denmark in 2009. In order to evaluate the model, a qualitative study based on structured interviews, focus group discussions and observations, was performed in four selected municipalities in Denmark: Frederiksberg, Odense, Amager and Esbjerg. The evaluation was undertaken by the Danish National Centre for Social Research. It is concluded that the PSP cooperation draws attention to marginalized groups of citizens and helps to prevent social downfall and crime. Participants of the PSP cooperations further highlight positive changes in the cooperation between the involved sectors, which is thought to further improve the support to vulnerable citizens and thereby enhance both prevention and follow up of cases. Furthermore, the recommendations drawn from the evaluation are to adapt PSP cooperations to local conditions, avoid unnecessary red-tape, keep a constant focus on citizens' ethics, as well as involve the frontline workers in the individual sectors, i.e. those who are actually in contact with marginalized citizens."}, {"Title": "The different faces of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease CJD in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive spongiform disease of the central nervous system.

An observational and retrospective study of 150 cocaine-dependent patients undergoing treatment in the Drug Unit of the Psychiatry Department of University Hospital Vall d\u05f3Hebron in Barcelona (Spain) using these three groups, NS, PS and CIPD, was performed. All patients were evaluated with the PRISM interview. ANOVA, \u03c72 tests and multivariate multinomial regression analysis were used to perform statistical analyses. Seven patients with a primary psychotic disorder were discharged. Forty-six patients (32.1%) did not report any psychotic symptoms. Ninety-seven patients (67.9%) presented with a history of any cocaine-induced psychotic symptom and were considered as the cocaine-induced psychotic (CIP) group. Among them, 39 (27.3%) were included in the PS group and 58 (40.6%) were included in the CIPD group. A history of imprisonment was found significantly more frequently in the PS group than in the NS group. The distribution of age at onset of dependence, lifetime cannabis abuse or dependence and imprisonment were significantly different between the NS and CIPD groups. We conclude that in cocaine-dependent patients, clinicians should be advised about the risk of development of psychotic symptoms. The presence of some psychotic symptoms could increase the potential risks of disturbing behaviours."}, {"Title": "Network dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia: implications for psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Structural and functional connectivity methods are changing how researchers conceptualize and explore neuropsychiatric disease. Here, we summarize emerging evidence of large-scale network dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, focusing on the divergent impact these disorders have on the default mode network and the salience network. We update a working model for understanding the functions of these networks within a broader anatomical context and highlight the relevance of this model for understanding psychiatric illness. Finally, we look ahead to persistent challenges in the application of network-based imaging methods to patients with Alzheimer's disease, behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, and other neuropsychiatric conditions. Recent advances and persistent needs are discussed, with an eye toward anticipating the hurdles that must be overcome for a network-based framework to clarify the biology of psychiatric illness and aid in the drug discovery process."}, {"Title": "Neuroscience and humanistic psychiatry: a residency curriculum.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry residencies with a commitment to humanism commonly prioritize training in psychotherapy, cultural psychiatry, mental health policy, promotion of human rights, and similar areas reliant upon dialogue and collaborative therapeutic relationships. The advent of neuroscience as a defining paradigm for psychiatry has challenged residencies with a humanistic focus due to common perceptions that it would entail constriction of psychiatric practice to diagnostic and psychopharmacology roles. The author describes a neuroscience curriculum that has taught psychopharmacology effectively, while also advancing effectiveness of language-based and relationship-based therapeutics.\nIn 2000, the George Washington University psychiatry residency initiated a neuroscience curriculum consisting of (1) a foundational postgraduate year 2 seminar teaching cognitive and social neuroscience and its integration into clinical psychopharmacology, (2) advanced seminars that utilized a neuroscience perspective in teaching specific psychotherapeutic skill sets, and (3) case-based teaching in outpatient clinical supervisions that incorporated a neuroscience perspective into traditional psychotherapy supervisions. Curricular assessment was conducted by (1) RRC reaccreditation site visit feedback, (2) examining career trajectories of residency graduates, (3) comparing PRITE exam Somatic Treatments subscale scores for 2010-2012 residents with pre-implementation residents, and (4) postresidency survey assessment by 2010-2012 graduates.\nThe 2011 RRC site visit report recommended a \"notable practice\" citation for \"innovative neurosciences curriculum.\" Three of twenty 2010-2012 graduates entered neuroscience research fellowships, as compared to none before the new curriculum. PRITE Somatic Treatments subscale scores improved from the 23rd percentile to the 62nd percentile in pre- to post-implementation of curriculum (p\u2009<\u2009.001). Recent graduates rated effectiveness of clinical psychopharmacology training as 8.6 on ten-point Likert scale.\nFrom multiple vantage points of assessment, these outcome results support effectiveness of this neuroscience curriculum for a residency committed to humanistic psychiatry as its primary mission. As a naturalistic study, further examination of its methods in pretest and posttest assessments and a multisite comparison is warranted."}, {"Title": "The prevalence of psychosis in epilepsy; a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Epilepsy has long been considered to be a risk factor for psychosis. However there is a lack of consistency in findings across studies on the effect size of this risk which reflects methodological differences in studies and changing diagnostic classifications within neurology and psychiatry. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of psychosis in epilepsy and to estimate the risk of psychosis among individuals with epilepsy compared with controls.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of all published literature pertaining to prevalence rates of psychosis in epilepsy using electronic databases PUBMED, OVIDMEDLINE, PsychINFO and Embase from their inception until September 2010 with the following search terms: prevalence, incidence, rate, rates, psychosis, schizophrenia, schizophreniform illness, epilepsy, seizures, temporal lobe epilepsy.\nThe literature search and search of reference lists yielded 215 papers. Of these, 58 (27%) had data relevant to the review and 157 were excluded following a more detailed assessment. 10% of the included studies were population based studies. The pooled odds ratio for risk of psychosis among people with epilepsy compared with controls was 7.8. The pooled estimate of prevalence of psychosis in epilepsy was found to be 5.6% (95% CI: 4.8-6.4). There was a high level of heterogeneity. The prevalence of psychosis in temporal lobe epilepsy was 7% (95% CI: 4.9-9.1). The prevalence of interictal psychosis in epilepsy was 5.2% (95% CI: 3.3-7.2). The prevalence of postictal psychosis in epilepsy was 2% (95% CI: 1.2-2.8).\nOur systematic review found that up to 6% of individuals with epilepsy have a co-morbid psychotic illness and that patients have an almost eight fold increased risk of psychosis. The prevalence rate of psychosis is higher in temporal lobe epilepsy (7%). We suggest that further investigation of this association could give clues to the aetiology of psychosis."}, {"Title": "[The oral health of patients in psychiatric institutions and related comorbidities].", "Abstract": "The oral health of inpatients who are treated for mental illness is very degraded compared with general population.

It was suspected that an acute infectious and/or inflammatory process in each patient was related to abrupt mental status changes, onset of sialorrhea, myoclonus, and/or need for ventilatory support. Investigations of altered mental status did not reveal alternative causes and presentations were not consistent with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, other acute neurologic complications, or psychiatric decompensation. All patients improved after clozapine dose reductions allowing for transfer from intensive care units. Using the Naranjo ADR Probability Scale for each case, a probable relation between clozapine toxicity and the infectious and/or inflammatory process was determined.\nClozapine toxicity may manifest with multiple symptoms, including sedation, sialorrhea, and hypotension. In addition to overdose and drug interactions; infection and/or inflammation may precipitate clozapine toxicity. This may be related to cytokine-mediated inhibition of cytochrome P450 1A2. The likelihood of toxicity via this mechanism has not been well characterized, thus careful monitoring is required for medically ill patients receiving clozapine. Clozapine is extensively bound to the acute phase reactant, \u03b1-1 acid glycoprotein, which may unpredictably protect against clinical toxicity. C-reactive protein has also been investigated to relate clozapine toxicity to infection and/or inflammation.\nClozapine toxicity developed in 3 patients admitted to a medical setting suspected to be related to infection and/or inflammation.

Ninety-three percent of training director respondents reported their program meets the ACGME program requirements for graduate medical education in forensic psychiatry. The forensic topics covered most thoroughly in general psychiatry training are involuntary civil commitment and violence risk assessment. The topics covered least thoroughly include exposure to courtroom testimony, writing a forensic report, and evaluating a defendant's criminal responsibility.

The survey questionnaire included 13 brief questions about the characteristics used to teach CPGs in the programs, as well as two demographic questions about each program and director. Descriptive statistics were reported for each questionnaire item by program classification (i.e., child and adolescent vs. general psychiatry).\nThe survey response rate was 49.8% (146 out of 293). Just 23% of programs reported having written goals and objectives related to teaching CPGs. The most frequently taught aspect of CPGs was their content (72% of programs). Didactic sessions were the most frequently employed teaching strategy (79% of programs). Regarding the application of CPG learning in treatment care settings, just 16% of programs applied algorithms in care settings, and 15% performed evaluations to determine consistency between CPG recommendations and care delivery. Only 8% of programs utilized audit and feedback to residents about their adherence to CPGs. Faculty time constraints and insufficient interest were the leading barriers (39% and 33% of programs, respectively) to CPG teaching, although 38% reported no barriers. However, child and adolescent programs less commonly identified insufficient interest among faculty as a barrier to teaching CPGs compared to general programs (20% vs. 43%). Moreover, compared to general programs, child and adolescent fellowship programs taught more aspects of CPGs, used more educational activities to teach the content of specific CPGs, and used more methods to evaluate the teaching of CPGs.\nAlthough the majority of programs provided some teaching of CPGs, the rigorousness of the teaching approaches was limited, especially attempts to evaluate the extent and effectiveness of their use in clinical care.

However, mental health problems facing individuals immediately after arrest and before arraignment have not been adequately studied. In New York City, prearraignment arrestees who require psychiatric hospitalization are temporarily transferred from police custody to correctional custody and admitted to the Bellevue Jail Psychiatry Service (BJPS) for treatment. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the impact of this jail hospitalization on the legal disposition of this vulnerable population. A retrospective chart review was conducted of 204 consecutively admitted male patient-arrestees on the BJPS. Results showed that admission to the BJPS delayed arraignment by an average of 8.03 days, with longer delays for individuals arrested outside of Manhattan. Although these delays are considered acceptable under legal precedent, concerns arise about the therapeutic impact of this practice on newly arrested individuals with severe mental illness."}, {"Title": "Obsessions of child murder: underrecognized manifestations of obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common illness that remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Distressing obsessions of violence are a frequent manifestation of OCD, related to overattribution of meaning to passing thoughts, a sense of overresponsibility, and concurrent confessing rituals to decrease related anxiety. These intrusive thoughts can include infanticidal or filicidal obsessions in new parents. There is little to no evidence to suggest that these thoughts pose a significant risk of harm, which is reflected in related professional treatment guidelines. In this study, we sought to examine the recognition and risk management preferences among psychiatry professionals and trainees regarding a case example description of filicide obsessions as a manifestation of OCD. A questionnaire regarding a case marked by filicide obsessions was emailed to psychiatrists and psychiatry residents. Respondents provided their preferred and differential diagnoses, reporting their perceptions of risk and optimal case management. Of the 43 respondents, only 62 percent considered OCD in the differential diagnosis. Those considering OCD in the differential diagnosis assessed risk of harm as being lower than did those who did not consider it (3.7 versus 6.6; F(1,36) = 12.18; p < .005). Despite this result, the majority of respondents included involuntary admission (60%) and reports to child welfare authorities (68%) among their preferred management strategies. This survey supports our contention that greater awareness of OCD and understanding of management strategies is needed among psychiatrists and trainees. As well, a greater awareness of the low risk of violence associated with this population is necessary to avoid penalizing individuals with OCD-related aggressive and infanticidal obsessions."}, {"Title": "[Aquatic therapy for children with autism].", "Abstract": "Nursing practices with autistic children in child psychiatry can be approached through the experience of a body-centred therapy group.

Several neurophysiological subtypes in ADHD and depression and their relation to treatment outcome are reviewed. The first important subgroup consists of the 'impaired vigilance' subgroup with often-reported excess frontal theta or alpha activity. This EEG subtype explains ADHD symptoms well based on the EEG Vigilance model, and these ADHD patients responds well to stimulant medication. In depression this subtype might be unresponsive to antidepressant treatments, and some studies suggest these depressive patients might respond better to stimulant medication. Further research should investigate whether sleep problems underlie this impaired vigilance subgroup, thereby perhaps providing a route to more specific treatments for this subgroup. Finally, a slow individual alpha peak frequency is an endophenotype associated with treatment resistance in ADHD and depression. Future studies should incorporate this endophenotype in clinical trials to investigate further the efficacy of new treatments in this substantial subgroup of patients."}, {"Title": "A case study on acupuncture in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "This report describes the use of acupuncture as an add on treatment for a patient with chronic schizophrenia.

A total of 207 professors from 110 Brazilian medical schools responded to an online semistructured questionnaire about the characteristics of the sexuality-related topics offered.\nThe main variables assessed were contact hours devoted to sexuality, disciplines in which sexuality topics were taught, sexuality-related course titles, and sexuality-related topics addressed. Questionnaires were tabulated and analyzed using descriptive statistics for frequency distribution.\nThe response rate to the questionnaire was 77.2%. Almost all professors (96.3%) addressed sexuality-related topics mainly in the third and fourth years as clinical disciplines, with a 6-hour load per discipline. Gynecology was the discipline in which sexuality-related topics were most often taught (51.5%), followed by urology (18%) and psychiatry (15%). Sexuality-related topics were addressed mainly in classes on sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS (62.4%) and on the anatomy and physiology of the reproductive system (55.4%). About 25% of the professors reported teaching courses with a sexuality-related title. There was emphasis on the impact of diseases and sexual habits (87.9%) and sexual dysfunction (75.9%).

The aim of this study was to examine the perceptions of clinical staff about the social climate of acute old age psychiatry inpatient units. Eighty-five clinicians were recruited from these facilities. They completed a survey questionnaire about the social climate or ward atmosphere of inpatient units. The findings showed that, to some extent, respondents' perceived patient cohesion and mutual support were evident, units were perceived somewhat positively as safe environments for patients and staff, and the ward climate helped meet patients' therapeutic needs. Overall, clinicians were somewhat positive about the social climate of the units, and this has implications for the perception of aggression in old age psychiatry inpatient settings. As there is a direct relationship between social climate and aggression, clinicians should consider adopting a broad-based, person-centred approach to the promotion of a favourable social climate in old age psychiatry inpatient settings."}, {"Title": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging study of external source memory and its relation to cognitive insight in non-clinical subjects.", "Abstract": "Previous research has linked cognitive insight (a measure of self-reflectiveness and self-certainty) in psychosis with neurocognitive and neuroanatomical disturbances in the fronto-hippocampal neural network. The authors' goal was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural correlates of cognitive insight during an external source memory paradigm in non-clinical subjects.\nAt encoding, 24 non-clinical subjects travelled through a virtual city where they came across 20 separate people, each paired with a unique object in a distinct location. fMRI data were then acquired while participants viewed images of the city, and completed source recognition memory judgments of where and with whom objects were seen, which is known to involve prefrontal cortex. Cognitive insight was assessed with the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale.\nExternal source memory was associated with neural activity in a widespread network consisting of frontal cortex, including ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), temporal and occipital cortices. Activation in VLPFC correlated with higher self-reflectiveness and activation in midbrain correlated with lower self-certainty during source memory attributions. Neither self-reflectiveness nor self-certainty significantly correlated with source memory accuracy.\nBy means of virtual reality and in the context of an external source memory paradigm, the study identified a preliminary functional neural basis for cognitive insight in the VLPFC in healthy people that accords with our fronto-hippocampal theoretical model as well as recent neuroimaging data in people with psychosis. The results may facilitate the understanding of the role of neural mechanisms in psychotic disorders associated with cognitive insight distortions."}, {"Title": "Use of movies for group therapy of psychiatric inpatients: theory and practice.", "Abstract": "This paper reports on the use of cinema therapy at a psychiatry clinic for inpatients.

Sleep staging is a time consuming and difficult task undertaken by sleep experts. This study aims to identify a method which would classify sleep stages automatically and with a high degree of accuracy and, in this manner, will assist sleep experts. This study consists of three stages: feature extraction, feature selection from EEG signals, and classification of these signals. In the feature extraction stage, it is used 20 attribute algorithms in four categories. 41 feature parameters were obtained from these algorithms. Feature selection is important in the elimination of irrelevant and redundant features and in this manner prediction accuracy is improved and computational overhead in classification is reduced. Effective feature selection algorithms such as minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR); fast correlation based feature selection (FCBF); ReliefF; t-test; and Fisher score algorithms are preferred at the feature selection stage in selecting a set of features which best represent EEG signals. The features obtained are used as input parameters for the classification algorithms. At the classification stage, five different classification algorithms (random forest (RF); feed-forward neural network (FFNN); decision tree (DT); support vector machine (SVM); and radial basis function neural network (RBF)) classify the problem. The results, obtained from different classification algorithms, are provided so that a comparison can be made between computation times and accuracy rates. Finally, it is obtained 97.03 % classification accuracy using the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method indicate the ability to design a new intelligent assistance sleep scoring system."}, {"Title": "Acute treatment of schizophrenia: introduction to the Word Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry guidelines.", "Abstract": "The goals and strategies of treatment in schizophrenia may vary according to the phase and severity of the illness.

Both first generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are effective in the acute treatment of schizophrenia and in relapse prevention.

Despite this progress, fundamental questions remain about the pathophysiology and etiology of MDD. More importantly, this body of work has yet to directly influence clinical practice. It has long been a goal for the fields of clinical psychology and psychiatry to have a means of making objective diagnoses of mental disorders. Frustratingly little movement has been achieved on this front, however, and the 'gold-standard' of diagnostic validity and reliability remains expert consensus. In light of this challenge, the focus of the current review is to provide a critical summary of key findings from different neuroimaging approaches in MDD research, including structural, functional and neurochemical imaging studies.

Specialty trainees were from a wide range of medical and surgical specialties, and psychiatry.\nImplementation of the WTR, while acknowledged as an improvement to the earlier situation of prolonged excessive hours, has not wholly overcome experience of long working hours and fatigue. Fatigue did not only arise from the hours that were scheduled, but also from an unpredictable mixture of shifts, work intensity (which often resulted in educational tasks being taken home) and inadequate rest. Fatigue was also caused by trainees working beyond their scheduled hours, for reasons such as task completion, accessing additional educational opportunities beyond scheduled hours and staffing shortages. There were also organisational, professional and cultural drivers, such as a sense of responsibility to patients and colleagues and the expectations of seniors. Fatigue was perceived to affect efficiency of skills and judgement, mood and learning capacity.\nLong-term risks of continued stress and fatigue, for doctors and for the effective delivery of a healthcare service, should not be ignored.

Antipsychotic drugs also may cause increase in the liver enzymes and serum bilirubin levels. The present report evaluates the case of a patient with risperidone-associated hepatocellular damage.\nA 19-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to the Department of Psychiatry with paranoid schizophrenia and risperidone was administered in a gradually increasing dose up to 8 mg/day. After 3 weeks of treatment, he experienced asthenia and weight loss. The level of aspartate aminotransferase was 283 IU/L (normal: <30 IU/L), and the alanine aminotransferase level was 778 IU/L (normal: <36 IU/L). Treatment with risperidone was immediately discontinued. Six days after drug withdrawal, the alanine aminotransferase level fell more than 50%, and a complete return to normalcy was seen within 2 months.\nIn the present case, a possible causal association between risperidone and hepatocellular damage has been observed due to the temporal relationship between the administration of the drug and the onset of hepatic abnormalities, and a following rapid recovery after stopping the drug. As the hepatic damage could be related to the plasma concentration of risperidone which is highly influenced by the hepatic enzyme CYP2D6, the patient was genotyped for CYP2D6. He was classified as homozygous wild type for CYP2D6.\nThe risk for developing hepatotoxicity during risperidone therapy cannot be supported by the patient CYP2D6 genotype. In clinical practice, it may be recommended to obtain baseline liver function tests before starting risperidone and regular screening for liver enzyme changes during therapy."}, {"Title": "Voluntary and therapeutic castration of sex offenders in The Netherlands (1938\u20131968).", "Abstract": "Between 1938 and 1968 some 400 sex offenders in the Netherlands who by court orders had been put at 'the discretion of the government' and were incarcerated in asylums for the criminally insane, 'voluntarily' submitted themselves to 'therapeutic' castration, the surgical removal of their testes. Prior to 1938, inspired by a Danish castration act from 1929, and urged by asylums that were overcrowded by sex offenders, the ethics of the surgery had been discussed for nearly a decade amongst theologians, (forensic) psychiatrists, jurists and politicians, mostly in the context of eugenic sterilization. Discussions of conflicting Catholic, Protestant and non-denominational points of view vis-\u00e0-vis eugenics resulted in consensus about 'therapeutic' and 'voluntary' castration. Sexual deviancy, according to some, was like a tumor located in the testes, which could therefore be removed without moral objections and the person was thus cured of his disease. Although obviously related to forensic psychiatry and concerned with issues like protection of society and treatment of offenders, discussions were never held in a strictly forensic context. Unlike in other countries in which castration policies were enforced, in The Netherlands the surgery was never embodied in law but subject to an informal protocol that covered political accountability. To satisfy Catholic objections references to eugenic aims were omitted from the documents, as were references to castration as a penalty.Based on international and Dutch literature (from both before and after 1938) as well as case histories, this article will show that the compromise about the therapeutic value of castration had no basis in medical knowledge, while 'voluntariness' (as elsewhere) was an acknowledged fallacy once surgeries had started. It was also acknowledged that castration did not really cure deviancy, but curbed libido and helped the castrate to suppress his urges. Nonetheless, because of the eugenic origins of discussions, associated with persistent confusion about the difference between castration and sterilization, it never became fully clear whether the surgery was meant to curb libido or to prevent the offenders from begetting inferior progeny."}, {"Title": "Proportion of depression among the elderly population in a rural health care setting.", "Abstract": "Depression among elderly has serious public health implications.

Despite this, it has been difficult to develop specific blockers of native mGlu7 signaling in relevant brain areas such as amygdala and limbic cortex. Here, we present the mGlu7-selective antagonist 7-hydroxy-3-(4-iodophenoxy)-4H-chromen-4-one (XAP044), which inhibits lateral amygdala long term potentiation (LTP) in brain slices from wild type mice with a half-maximal blockade at 88 nm. There was no effect of XAP044 on LTP of mGlu7-deficient mice, indicating that this pharmacological effect is mGlu7-dependent. Unexpectedly and in contrast to all previous mGlu7-selective drugs, XAP044 does not act via the seven-transmembrane region but rather via a binding pocket localized in mGlu7's extracellular Venus flytrap domain, a region generally known for orthosteric agonist binding. This was shown by chimeric receptor studies in recombinant cell line assays. XAP044 demonstrates good brain exposure and wide spectrum anti-stress and antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like efficacy in rodent behavioral paradigms. XAP044 reduces freezing during acquisition of Pavlovian fear and reduces innate anxiety, which is consistent with the phenotypes of mGlu7-deficient mice, the results of mGlu7 siRNA knockdown studies, and the inhibition of amygdala LTP by XAP044. Thus, we present an mGlu7 antagonist with a novel molecular mode of pharmacological action, providing significant application potential in psychiatry. Modeling the selective interaction between XAP044 and mGlu7's Venus flytrap domain, whose three-dimensional structure is already known, will facilitate future drug development supported by computer-assisted drug design."}, {"Title": "'Febrile anxiety', by Robert James (1745): with an introduction by.", "Abstract": "The current class of psychiatric conditions called 'Anxiety Disorders' was constructed during the 20th century.

Whether it can be claimed that the complaints included under the 'Anxiety Disorders' have always existed, that is, constitute a form of 'natural kind', is a moot point that needs further historical investigation. This is because psychiatric complaints (mental symptoms) are no more than culturally configured segments of biological or symbolic information.

The Mental Treatment Act 1930 introduced voluntary admission for early, supposedly treatable cases, although there was paucity of effective treatment. In the mid-1930s shock therapies, administered with great enthusiasm by asylum doctors, promised to cure insanity by physical means.

The practice received little attention until the arrival of antipsychotic drugs, which replaced older sedatives and became the agents most strongly associated with the treatment of aggression and challenging behaviour. Emergency sedation was subsequently portrayed in psychiatric literature and advertising as a therapeutic and diagnosis-driven endeavour, and the concept of rapid tranquillisation emerged in this context in the 1970s. Use of non-antipsychotic sedatives, like the benzodiazepines, is barely visible in contemporary sources, and the research suggests that antipsychotics became the mainstay of rapid tranquillisation strategies because of beliefs about their specific therapeutic properties in psychosis and schizophrenia, and not because of demonstrated superiority over other agents."}, {"Title": "Therapeutic Fascism: re-educating communists in Nazi-occupied Serbia, 1942-44.", "Abstract": "This article probes the relationship between psychoanalysis and right-wing authoritarianism, and analyses a unique psychotherapeutic institution established by Serbia's World War II collaborationist regime.

In order to stem the rapid spread of Communism, the collaborationist state, led by its most extreme fascistic elements, officially embraced psychotherapy, the 'talking cure' and Freudianism, and conjured up its own theory of mental pathology and trauma - one that directly contradicted the Nazi concepts of society and the individual.

Framed in terms of self-development, citizenship took on a broad meaning, not just in terms of political rights and obligations, but also in the context of material, social, psychological and moral conditions that individuals should meet in order to develop themselves and be able to act according to those rights and obligations in a responsible way. In the post-war period of reconstruction (1945-65), as well as between 1965 and 1985, the link between mental health and ideals of citizenship was coloured by the public memory of World War II and the German occupation, albeit in completely different, even opposite ways. The memory of the war, and especially the public consideration of its victims, changed drastically in the mid-1960s, and the mental health sector played a crucial role in bringing this change about. The widespread attention to the mental effects of the war that surfaced in the late 1960s after a period of 20 years of public silence should be seen against the backdrop of the combination of democratization and the emancipation of emotions."}, {"Title": "Gaining translational momentum: more zebrafish models for neuroscience research.", "Abstract": "Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are rapidly becoming a popular model organism in translational neuroscience and biological psychiatry research.

The study confirmed a possibility to reduce the number of items to nine out of the original 25 while improving internal consistency, test-retest and inter-rater reliability, and maintaining high correlation with the original EXIT25 score, and moderate inverse correlation with the Mini-Mental State Examination score.\nThere is potential to abbreviate the original EXIT25, and improve internal consistency and hierarchical scaling properties.

Herein, we present the case of a patient with spontaneous ejaculation that developed when severity of PTSD symptoms increased.\nOur patient was a 25-year-old single man admitted to a psychiatric polyclinic because of PTSD symptoms and concurrent spontaneous ejaculations. He was diagnosed with PTSD after clinical interviews. Organic pathology to explain spontaneous ejaculations was not detected. Paroxetine treatment was initiated and PTSD symptoms and frequency of spontaneous ejaculations were decreased at the clinical follow-up.\nAssessment of the presented case in the light of the literature indicates that his re-experiencing (flashbacks, nightmare) and hyperarousal (symptoms of anxiety specific to PTSD) led to an increase in adrenergic system activation and, consequently, spontaneous ejaculation without sexual stimulus. The effect of Paroxetine in decreasing the frequency of spontaneous erection and ejaculation in the presented case is thought to have occurred via control of PTSD symptoms and their adverse effects on ejaculation. Treatment based on a consideration of PTSD symptoms and autonomic instability might increase the positive outcome rate in such patients."}, {"Title": "Work-related stress, job resources, and well-being among psychiatrists and other medical specialists in Finland.", "Abstract": "Previous studies suggest that psychiatrists may be more stressed than other medical specialists and mental health professionals. This study examined differences in stress factors, job resources, psychological distress, and job satisfaction between psychiatrists and other medical specialists. In addition, the study examined whether stress factors or job resources accounted for possible differences between the groups in psychological distress or job satisfaction.\nIn 2010, the authors obtained cross-sectional, Web-based survey data from a random sample of 2,776 Finnish physicians, including 1,647 women (59%), ranging in age from 25 to 69 years old. Comparisons between the two groups used analyses of covariance adjusted for gender, age, and employment sector.\nPsychiatrists were less satisfied with their jobs, felt more stressed about patients, and experienced more psychological distress compared with other medical specialists. However, psychiatrists had more opportunities to control their jobs and better team climate compared with other medical specialists. High psychological distress among psychiatrists was partly accounted for by high patient-related stress. The differences in psychological distress and job satisfaction between the two groups were not accounted for by work-family conflicts or optimism.\nIt is important to try to alleviate the high levels of patient-related stress among psychiatrists and to further increase their job resources. Doing so may enhance the attractiveness of psychiatry as a specialty choice."}, {"Title": "Clinicians' utilization of child mental health telephone consultation in primary care: findings from Massachusetts.", "Abstract": "The authors examined utilization of the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project, a mental health telephone consultation service for primary care, hypothesizing that greater use would be related to severe psychiatric diagnoses and polypharmacy.\nThe authors examined the association between utilization, defined as the mean number of contacts per patient during the 180 days following the initial contact (July 2008-June 2009), and characteristics of the initial contact, including consultation question, the child's primary mental health problem, psychotropic medication regimen, insurance status, and time of year.\nUtilization (N=4,436 initial contacts, mean=3.83 contacts) was associated with initial contacts about medication management, polypharmacy, public and private health insurance, and time of year.

Though there is an increasing amount of research on prescription medication misuse, a relatively small number of studies focus on adolescent BZ misuse. The goal of this study, therefore, is to identify demographic and psychosocial factors that place adolescents at risk for misusing BZs. Additionally, the authors applied concepts from social bonding theory, social learning theory, and strain theory to determine the extent to which these concepts explain BZ misuse.\nUsing data from the 2011 National Survey of Drug Use & Health, multivariate logistic regression models were estimated to determine which factors were associated with an increased risk of BZ misuse.\nThese findings help to describe the psychosocial profile of adolescent BZ misusers which should increase the ability of clinicians to identify patients who may be at greater risk for misuse.\nThis study is particularly important within the context of psychiatry, where a clearer understanding of adolescent BZ misuse is critical for informing prevention efforts and developing best practices for prescribing BZs."}, {"Title": "[The disclosed DSM-5: what impact will it have on forensic psychiatry?].", "Abstract": "On 10 February 2010, the American Psychiatric Association published an online draft of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which, like the previous editions, after having received several comments and contributions, was subject during the next following years, to the technical and scientific scrutiny, and, of course, susceptible to modification leading to a final improved version.\nThis article aims to analyze the changes proposed by this new review, investigate whether these have implications in the field of Forensic Psychiatry and discuss the implications identified.\nIn this perspective, the object of analysis are issues related to the classification and structuring of nosological entities, with special focus on personality disorders, substance abuse disorders, sexual and gender identity disorders, anxiety disorders, dissociative disorders, psychotic disorders and also disorders suggested by external sources.\nthe main changes proposed are essentially about diagnostic criteria, which, for some of nosological entities, may hinder the outcome of the expert assessment, while for others there could be otherwise, since the introduction of new models closer to reality appears to offer greater objectivity and diagnostic rigor."}, {"Title": "Unusual trichobezoar of the stomach and the intestine: a case report.", "Abstract": "Trichobezoars are an infrequent form of bezoar found in the stomach or intestine, created from ingested hair.

An examination showed a trichobezoar requiring emergent surgical intervention, and indicating the need for psychiatric treatment. The trichobezoar was treated successfully by laparotomy.\nThe medical and psychiatric sequelae of trichotillomania should not be underestimated, and early diagnosis and treatment is of utmost importance to save the patient's life and prevent recurrence. Although laparotomy is still considered an excellent option, pharmacotherapy and behavioral assessment play a useful role in patient management. Our case highlights the fundamental concept of a holistic approach rather than only treating the symptoms, by considering factors such as genetic influences to understand the disease."}, {"Title": "Paediatric psychotropic prescribing practices in Ireland.", "Abstract": "This study describes the attitudes, knowledge and prescribing of psychotropic medication in children.\nA study-specific questionnaire was mailed to all child psychiatrists, paediatricians and a group of registered general practitioners (GPs) from a selected Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services catchment area.\nIn the 116 respondents who replied (39% response rate), psychotropic medication was generally valued and used by all groups (70.1%). Respondents believed that the majority (61.9%) of their non-medical colleagues would also value/support the use of medication and this endorsement influenced the respondents' prescribing rates. Initiating medication was viewed as the province of child psychiatry (78.6%). Medication is felt to be justified in a wide variety of mental health disorders, their use being reserved for severe presentations, with psychostimulants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors being most used. A significant number of GPs (60.9%) and paediatricians (63.4%) were felt to be lacking in competence in psychotropic prescribing, with a general request for more seminars in this area (61.5%) with almost half (45%) of them believing that they would prescribe more often.\nThe use of psychotropic medication in children remains a valued and common practice in Ireland. Attitudinal and practice differences across professional groups exist, and although the experience is one of relative safety there was a strong desire for further education leading to a perceived increase in utilisation. The impact of perceived public opinion regarding psychotropic prescribing along with a lack of competence may represent a major barrier to effective prescribing, thus highlighting the importance of ongoing professional development and increased public health initiatives to increase knowledge and understanding in this increasingly important area."}, {"Title": "Alterations of Lipid-Lipoprotein and Leptin in Bipolar Disorder Associated with Clinic Process.", "Abstract": "Obesity is more common among patients with bipolar disorder as compared to normal population.

In particular, the concept of intersubjectivity defended by the phenomenology as an embodied practice, is being supported by the results of investigations carried out on the basis of the cognitive neuroscience and developmental psychology. Authors from different roots, such as J. Bruner and S. Gallagher propose considering these types of interdisciplinary collaboration as a possible way to integrate the traditions of the explanation and understanding. The purpose of this paper is to analyze to what extent this collaboration between phenomenology and sciences, particularly on the subject of understanding others and their relevance for the understanding of certain psychopathologies, has allowed to close the gap that had opened in the nineteenth century between these traditions."}, {"Title": "[Mental Imagery: Neurophysiology and Implications in Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "To provide an explanation about what mental imagery is and some implications in psychiatry.\nThis article is a narrative literature review.\nThere are many terms in which imagery representations are described in different fields of research.

Using dosing equations, expected lithium doses were calculated based on corresponding serum concentrations identified in patient charts. Expected doses were then compared with actual lithium doses. The primary end point was to assess the accuracy and precision of dosing equations using mean differences in daily lithium doses and standard deviations. Secondary end points included presence of pertinent laboratory tests and use of concomitant interacting drugs .\nOf 155 patients identified, 59 were eligible for analysis. Equations developed by Abou-Auda et al and Pepin et al did not predict doses that were significantly different from actual doses. Conversely, equations by Jermain et al, Terao et al, and Zetinet al did predict statistically different doses.\nAbou-Auda et al developed a predictive lithium dosing equation that was more accurate than equations developed by Jermain et al, Terao et al, and Zetin et al and more precise than the Pepin et al equation.

Obsessions are intrusive, recurrent, and persistent unwanted thoughts. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual feels driven to perform in response to the obsessions. The heterogeneity of OCD includes themes of obsessions, types of rituals, presence or absence of tics, etiology, genetics, and response to pharmacotherapy. Complications of OCD include interpersonal difficulties, unemployment, substance abuse, criminal justice issues, and physical injuries. Areas of the brain involved in the pathophysiology include the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, and basal ganglia. Overall, OCD may be due to a malfunction in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit in the brain. Neurotransmitters implicated in OCD include serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate. Numerous drugs such as atypical antipsychotics and dopaminergic agents can cause or exacerbate OCD symptoms. The etiology includes genetics and neurological insults. Treatment of OCD includes psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic simulation, and in extreme cases surgery. Exposure and response prevention is the most effective form of psychotherapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the preferred pharmacotherapy. Higher doses than listed in the package insert and a longer trial are often needed for SSRIs than compared to other psychiatric disorders. Alternatives to SSRIs include clomipramine and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Treatment of resistant cases includes augmentation with atypical antipsychotics, pindolol, buspirone, and glutamate-blocking agents."}, {"Title": "Presenting symptoms in adults with the 22q11 deletion syndrome.", "Abstract": "A definitive molecular diagnosis of 22q11 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS) even if occurring later in life, has important genetic, medical and emotional impact on the patients and their families.

A retrospective study was performed on 65 individuals diagnosed with 22q11DS at adult age. Data were collected on adults referred to the genetic clinic or actively recruited through systematic diagnostic examination in both institutions and a psychiatric unit for intellectually disabled. Presenting symptoms were categorized into seven groups: familial occurrence, intellectual disability, cardiac anomalies, palatal anomalies, facial dysmorphic features, psychiatric problems and 'other' (comprising all other features associated with 22q11DS). Age at diagnosis was defined as the age at which the 22q11.2 deletion was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization or comparative genomic hybridization. Ascertainment subgroups were different in presenting symptoms and age at diagnosis. Adults were referred to the genetic clinic mainly because of familial occurrence, cardiac defects and psychiatric disorders whereas adults diagnosed in institutions for intellectually disabled presented mainly with moderate to severe intellectual disability and psychotic disorders. Adults diagnosed at the psychiatric unit for intellectually disabled had a variety of psychiatric disorders but none of them had additional physical features.

A decade of research on in this region, along with a number of shorter research trips to healing shrines and specialists elsewhere in the subcontinent, and a thorough study of the literature, suggest that such techniques are often therapeutically effective. However, several considerations suggest that ritual healing may not be usefully combined with mainstream \"Western\" psychiatry: (a) psychiatry is deeply influenced by the ideology of individualism, which is incompatible with South Asian understandings of the person; (b) social asymmetries between religious healers and health professionals are too great to allow a truly respectful relationship between them; and (c) neither the science of psychiatry nor the regulatory apparatus of the state can or will acknowledge the validity of \"ritual therapy\"--and even if they did so, regulation would most likely destroy what is most valuable about ritual healing.

Furthermore, preliminary criteria for \"Caffeine Use Disorder\" and \"Internet Gaming Disorder\" have now been defined in the manual. Adopting the DSM-5 criteria catalogue within the German treatment system for children and adolescents with substance use disorders or at risk for developing substance use disorders would be of great significance. Since the diagnostic threshold is lower, more patients would be eligible for treatment. Thus, early intervention in the area of substance use disorders should be strengthened, a development that appears to be highly desirable from the perspective of child and adolescent psychiatry.

In five cases there was also concurrent hypoacusis, to a greater or lesser extent, and one had been triggered by pentoxifylline. In most instances, the musical content of the hallucinations had its origins in music experienced in childhood and early youth. In the cases submitted to pharmacological treatment, the response was poor. Yet, after explaining to the patients that the condition was benign and had no connection with a psychotic pathology, the degree of acceptance of the symptoms was good.\nMusical hallucinations are a little-known pathology lying on the borderline between neurology, otorhinolaryngology and psychiatry which are often wrongly linked to mental disease.

When all (9) significant univariate factors associated with 12-month post-discharge DSH-R were analyzed in a multivariate logistic regression, the MINI Suicidal Scale (p = 0.043), a lack of insight (p = 0.040), and triglyceride level (p = 0.020) remained significant. The estimated 12-month area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC-AUC) for DSH-R was 0.74 for triglycerides, 0.81 for the MINI, 0.89 for the MINI + psychosocial factors, and 0.91 for the MINI + psychosocial factors + triglycerides. The applied multifaceted approach also significantly discriminated between 12-month post-discharge DSH-R patients and other DSH patients, and a lack of insight (p = 0.047) and triglycerides (p = 0.046) remained significant for DSH-R patients in a multivariate analysis in which other DSH patients served as the reference group (rather than non-DSH patients).\nThe triglyceride values provided incremental validity to the MINI Suicidal Scale and psychosocial risk factors in the assessment of the risk of repeated DSH.

It is widely used throughout child, adolescent and adult psychiatry settings in Sweden but has not been validated up to date.\nThe aim of the current study was to examine the psychometric properties of the BOCS amongst a psychiatric outpatient population.\nThe BOCS consists of a 15-item Symptom Checklist including three items (hoarding, dysmorphophobia and self-harm) related to the DSM-5 category \"Obsessive-compulsive related disorders\", accompanied by a single six-item Severity Scale for obsessions and compulsions combined. It encompasses the revisions made in the Y-BOCS-II severity scale by including obsessive-compulsive free intervals, extent of avoidance and excluding the resistance item. 402 adult psychiatric outpatients with OCD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder and other psychiatric disorders completed the BOCS.\nPrincipal component factor analysis produced five subscales titled \"Symmetry\", \"Forbidden thoughts\", \"Contamination\", \"Magical thoughts\" and \"Dysmorphic thoughts\". The OCD group scored higher than the other diagnostic groups in all subscales (P < 0.001). Sensitivities, specificities and internal consistency for both the Symptom Checklist and the Severity Scale emerged high (Symptom Checklist: sensitivity = 85%, specificities = 62-70% Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.81; Severity Scale: sensitivity = 72%, specificities = 75-84%, Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.94).\nThe BOCS has the ability to discriminate OCD from other non-OCD related psychiatric disorders.

As part of a curriculum for a two year Master of Science (MSC) in Mental Health program for non-physician clinicians, child psychiatry training was designed and implemented by Jimma University with the involvement of experts from Addis Ababa University (AAU), Ethiopia, and Ludwig-Maximillian's University, (LMU), Germany. Graduates gave feedback after completing the course. The World Health Organization's (WHO) Mental Health Gap Action Program (mhGAP) intervention guide (IG) adapted for Ethiopian context was used as the main training material.\nA two-week child psychiatry course and a four week child psychiatry clinical internship were successfully implemented during the first and the second years of the MSC program respectively. During the two week psychiatry course, trainees learned to observe the behavior and to assess the mental status of children at different ages who had a variety of mental health conditions. Assessment of the trainees' clinical skills was done by the instructors at the end of the child psychiatry course as well as during the subsequent four week clinical internship. The trainees generally rated the course to be 'very good' to 'excellent'.

All women had exposure to moderate-to-severe childhood trauma as determined by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.\nWe examined the relationship between depressive symptomatology and resilience (the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale) and investigated whether trauma exposure or the presence of post-traumatic stress symptomatology mediated this relationship through the Sobel test for mediation and PLS path analysis.\nThere was a significant negative correlation between depressive symptomatology and resilience (p=<0.01). PLS path analysis revealed a significant direct effect between depression and resilience. On the Sobel test for mediation, distal (childhood trauma) and proximal traumatic events did not significantly mediate this association (p=>\u20090.05). However, post-traumatic stress symptomatology significantly mediated the relationship between depression and resilience in trauma-exposed women living with HIV.\nIn the present study, higher levels of resilience were associated with lower levels of self-reported depression. Although causal inferences are not possible, this suggests that in this sample, resilience may act as protective factor against the development of clinical depression. The results also indicate that post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), which are highly prevalent in HIV-infected and trauma\u00a0exposed individuals and often comorbid with depression, may further explain and account for this relationship. Further investigation is required to determine whether early identification and treatment of PTSS in this population may ameliorate the onset and persistence of major depression."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry on trial: the Norway 2011 massacre.", "Abstract": "On July 22, 2011, Anders Breivik, a Norwegian citizen, detonated a fertilizer bomb near government buildings in Oslo, killing eight people, and then proceeded to a nearby island where the Labor Party was holding a youth camp.

Much of the ensuing media coverage and trial focused on whether he was sane and whether he had a psychiatric diagnosis. One team of court-appointed psychiatrists found him to be psychotic with a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and legally insane.

Seminal and representative works from this set of articles and a limited selection of articles from other journals were included in the review.\nThe early psychosocial research emphasized psychoanalytic formulations of alcohol use as a defensive symptom, which informed the early experimental research on the tension-reducing properties of alcohol. The \"cognitive revolution,\" occurring in the 1970s, enabled an expansion of the tension-reduction theory to include a central role for mental processes (e.g., alcohol expectancies) in promoting drinking to cope with negative affectivity. The early clinical research characterized mental conditions commonly co-occurring with alcohol disorders and considered their etiological relationship to alcohol disorders. The \"neo-Kraepelinian revolution\" in psychiatry, which also occurred in the 1970s, infused the clinical comorbidity research with a more rigorous diagnostic technology and a range of biomedical research methodologies to study the mechanistic linkages of co-occurring disorders.\nAlthough a substantial quantity of scientific information on comorbidity has accumulated over the past 75 years, a standard model(s) of comorbidity has yet to congeal.

In a logistic regression model, adjusting for confounding by age, body mass index, and gender, HMW adiponectin and its ratio to total adiponectin were significantly associated with ADHD. In partial correlations, HMW adiponectin and its ratio to total adiponectin were significantly inversely correlated with self-reported psychiatric symptomatology. A non significant trend for higher levels of total adiponectin was observed in patients carrying CDH13 missense mutations compared to patients with wild type CDH13. The association of CDH13 mutations with adiponectin levels should be investigated in larger studies.

Animal models have shown that a hit in early life to the immune system might trigger a lifelong increased immune reactivity. Many epidemiological and clinical studies show the role of various infectious agents as risk factors for schizophrenia with overlap to other psychoses. The first large-scale epidemiological study in psychiatry from Denmark clearly demonstrates severe infections and autoimmune disorders during lifetime to be risk factors for schizophrenia. Genetic studies have shown the strongest signal for schizophrenia on chromosome 6p22.1, in a region related to the major histocompatibility complex and other immune functions. The vulnerability-stress-inflammation model is important as stress may increase proinflammatory cytokines and even contribute to a lasting proinflammatory state. The immune system itself is considered an important further piece in the puzzle, as in autoimmune disorders in general, which are always linked to three factors: genes, the environment and the immune system. Alterations of dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission have been shown with low-level neuroinflammation and may directly be involved in the generation of schizophrenic symptoms. Loss of central nervous system volume and microglial activation has been demonstrated in schizophrenia in neuroimaging studies, which supports the assumption of a low-level neuroinflammatory process. Further support comes from the therapeutic benefit of anti-inflammatory medications in specific studies and the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory intrinsic effects of antipsychotics."}, {"Title": "Factors associated with trajectories of psychological distress for Australian fathers across the early parenting period.", "Abstract": "Little is known about the course of fathers' psychological distress and associated risk factors beyond the postnatal period.

The most important advantages of VR are the high ecological validity of virtual environments, the entire controllability of virtual stimuli in the virtual environment and the capability to induce the sensation of being in the virtual environment instead of the physical environment. VRs provide the opportunity to face the user with stimuli and situations which are not available or too risky in reality. Despite these advantages VR-based applications have not yet been applied in forensic psychiatry.\nOn the basis of an overview of the recent state-of-the-art in VR-based applications in general psychiatry, the article demonstrates the advantages and possibilities of VR-based applications in forensic psychiatry.\nUp to now only preliminary studies regarding the VR-based assessment of pedophilic interests exist. These studies demonstrate the potential of ecologically valid VR-based applications for the assessment of forensically relevant disorders. One of the most important advantages is the possibility of VR to assess the behavior of forensic inpatients in crime-related situations without endangering others.

Another so far neglected yet relevant field is the business world. The so-called successful female psychopaths are characterized by highly psychopathic traits but low antisocial behavior, at least with reference to criminal behavior. The basis for investigating and interpreting gender differences is the assessment of psychopathy. Gender differences have been repeatedly demonstrated, especially in the assessment of antisocial behavior and the differentiation of borderline personality disorder and psychopathy which have to be addressed. Group comparisons based on these diagnostic methods found lower inhibitory deficits but less aggressive behavior in female participants with respect to the first main symptom category. For the second symptom category, emotional detachment, so far there are almost no findings reporting gender differences but only few direct gender comparisons have been carried out. However, highly psychopathic women from the general population demonstrate a stronger correlation between psychopathic traits and self-perception as negotiation partner compared to men: they make more use of manipulation and perceive themselves as more powerful in negotiation situations.

Feedback from the nurses was quite encouraging and the further use of BVC seems promising. The lack of standardized violence risk assessment instrument has disadvantaged nurses in clinical practice in China, where violent behaviour is an increasing problem. This study conducted a validation of the Br\u00f8set Violence Checklist that has proven effective in violence risk prediction in other countries. A sample of 296 patients consecutively admitted to two wards of a psychiatric hospital in Beijing was recruited. These patients were assessed on day shift and evening shift for the first seven days of hospitalization. Violence data and preventive measures were concurrently collected from nursing records and case reports. A total of 3707 assessments for 281 patients were collected revealing 93 episodes of violence among 55 patients. Receiver operating characteristics yielded an area under the curve of 0.85. At the cut-off point of one, its sensitivity/specificity was 78.5%/88.2% and the corresponding positive/negative predictive value was 14.6%/99.4%. In some false positive cases, intense preventive measures had been implemented. Positive feedback from the nurses was gained. The Br\u00f8set Violence Checklist was proved as an easy-to-use and time-saving instrument, therefore, regarded as a promising tool to determine if the psychiatric users are potentially violent in the short term."}, {"Title": "How contact lens comfort may be influenced by psychiatric and psychological conditions and mechanisms.", "Abstract": "End-of-day soft contact lens awareness, dryness and discomfort are common related problems and may be associated with lens surface dryness and soiling as well as signs of ocular discomfort. Similar symptoms may be reported by patients who do not have obviously degraded lenses or ocular signs of discomfort. This review examines some psychiatric and psychological conditions and mechanisms which may predispose toward or enhance the likelihood of these symptoms occurring and becoming a problem. For example, conditions such as depression, anxiety and stress may lower the threshold for the perception of discomfort. Chronic ocular inflammation associated with contact lens wear may result in neuroplastic lowering of nociceptive thresholds and enhancement of the perception of discomfort. End-of-day tiredness and reduced levels of demand from top-down activity may make it harder to maintain goal-relevant attention and the associated ability to inhibit sensory stimuli (such as lens awareness) that would otherwise not capture attention. Lens surface lubricity experienced on lens insertion may be higher than normal for corneal or conjunctival surfaces and create expectations of very high comfort levels, which are not apparent after lens surface dehydration, soiling or other lens changes have accumulated during the day. Psychiatric and psychological conditions and mechanisms may not only contribute to the perception of discomfort, when the lens and ocular condition appear normal but also may contribute to the perception of discomfort, when lens surface drying and soiling are evident and/or discomfort such as chronic ocular inflammation is apparent."}, {"Title": "[Sabina Spielrein: child psychiatrist avant la lettre].", "Abstract": "Nowadays Sabine Spielrein is remembered primarily because of her very early work (directly influenced by Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung) or because of her 'amour fou' with Jung. As a result, we tend to forget her role as a pioneer of child psychiatry and psychology and as a contributor to child analysis and play therapy.\nTo cast new light on Spielrein as a forgotten pioneer of child psychiatry.\nA review of the primary and secondary literature.\nThe one-sided depiction of Spielrein and her work in the secondary literature has been corrected. Starting from her initial interest in psychoanalysis, the multifaceted Spielrein evolved towards developmental and experimental research. Spielrein's importance lies with her pioneers role and her contribution to the developing (integrative) child psychiatry.\nSpielrein's largely forgotten work can be seen as a prefiguration of integrative child psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Substance misuse teaching in undergraduate medical education.", "Abstract": "Over 12,000 hospital admissions in the UK result from substance misuse, therefore issues surrounding this need to be addressed early on in a doctor's training to facilitate their interaction with this client group. Currently, undergraduate medical education includes teaching substance misuse issues, yet how this is formally integrated into the curriculum remains unclear.\nSemi-structured interviews with 17 key members of staff responsible for the whole or part of the undergraduate medical curriculum were conducted to identify the methods used to teach substance misuse. Using a previously devised toolkit, 19 curriculum co-ordinators then mapped the actual teaching sessions that addressed substance misuse learning objectives.\nSubstance misuse teaching was delivered primarily in psychiatry modules but learning objectives were also found in other areas such as primary care placements and problem-based learning. On average, 53 teaching sessions per medical school focused on bio-psycho-social models of addiction whereas only 23 sessions per medical school focused on professionalism, fitness to practice and students' own health in relation to substance misuse. Many sessions addressed specific learning objectives relating to the clinical features of substance dependence whereas few focused on iatrogenic addiction.\nSubstance misuse teaching is now inter-disciplinary and the frequent focus on clinical, psychological and social effects of substance misuse emphasises the bio-psycho-social approach underlying clinical practice. Some areas however are not frequently taught in the formal curriculum and these need to be addressed in future changes to medical education."}, {"Title": "Renal function in geriatric psychiatry patients compared to non-psychiatric older adults: effects of lithium use and other factors.", "Abstract": "Chronic renal failure is very common, affecting 30%-40% of community-dwelling elderly. We wished to verify whether geriatric psychiatry patients are at increased risk of renal dysfunction compared to elderly controls, as well as whether lithium exposure and other factors are important predictors of risk.\nThis is a four-year retrospective cohort and nested case-control study at a Canadian tertiary-care hospital using data from March 2007 to March 2011. We compared 82 geriatric psychiatry outpatients and 200 psychotropic-na\u00efve family medicine controls aged \u226565. Our main continuous measure of renal outcome was change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Multivariate analyses were performed to determine potential risk factors for renal dysfunction in geriatric psychiatry patients, including age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, diuretics, and lithium duration.\nClinically important decreases in eGFR (>8\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m(2)) were found in 40.2% of geriatric psychiatry patients compared to 29.5% of controls (p = 0.040). Multivariate analyses found that lithium duration was independently associated with adverse renal outcome in patients with eGFR < 60\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m(2). In this sub-population, lithium users had clinically important decreases in eGFR when compared to non-lithium users: 10.3\u00a0vs. 0.40\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m(2) (p = 0.017).\nGeriatric psychiatry patients are at a greater risk for clinically important decreases of renal function than similarly aged controls. Lithium appears to be an important risk factor for renal dysfunction when eGFR is <60\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m(2). However, in the majority of older adults who have normal kidney function, lithium use appears to be safe."}, {"Title": "Psycho-informatics: Big Data shaping modern psychometrics.", "Abstract": "For the first time in history, it is possible to study human behavior on great scale and in fine detail simultaneously. Online services and ubiquitous computational devices, such as smartphones and modern cars, record our everyday activity. The resulting Big Data offers unprecedented opportunities for tracking and analyzing behavior. This paper hypothesizes the applicability and impact of Big Data technologies in the context of psychometrics both for research and clinical applications. It first outlines the state of the art, including the severe shortcomings with respect to quality and quantity of the resulting data. It then presents a technological vision, comprised of (i) numerous data sources such as mobile devices and sensors, (ii) a central data store, and (iii) an analytical platform, employing techniques from data mining and machine learning. To further illustrate the dramatic benefits of the proposed methodologies, the paper then outlines two current projects, logging and analyzing smartphone usage. One such study attempts to thereby quantify severity of major depression dynamically; the other investigates (mobile) Internet Addiction. Finally, the paper addresses some of the ethical issues inherent to Big Data technologies. In summary, the proposed approach is about to induce the single biggest methodological shift since the beginning of psychology or psychiatry. The resulting range of applications will dramatically shape the daily routines of researches and medical practitioners alike. Indeed, transferring techniques from computer science to psychiatry and psychology is about to establish Psycho-Informatics, an entire research direction of its own."}, {"Title": "The reliability and validity of the rating scale of criminal responsibility for mentally disordered offenders.", "Abstract": "In China, the criminal responsibility of the mentally disordered offenders is divided into three levels, there are the whole responsibility, diminished responsibility and irresponsibility. According to the Criminal Law, \"If a mental disordered patient causes harmful consequences at a time when he is unable to recognize or control his own conduct, upon verification and confirmation through legal procedure, he shall not bear criminal responsibility.\" That means there are two standards of assessing criminal responsibility, namely volitional and cognitive capacity. It is as equal as the Mc'Naughton Rule and the Irresistible Impulse Test. But for a long time, the criminal responsibility was assessed mainly by experience because of lacking of standardized assessment instrument. Recently, we have developed \"the rating scale of criminal responsibility for mentally disordered offenders (RSCRs)\". The scale includes eighteen items, namely criminal motivation, aura before offense, inducement of crime, time and place and object and tool selectivity of crime, emotion during the crime, shirking responsibility after offense, concealing the truth during inquest, camouflage, understanding the nature of the offense, estimating the consequence of the offense, impairment of life ability, impairment of learning or work, impairment of insight, impairment of reality testing, and impairment of self-control. This scale can be applicable for all cases and easy to use. This scale had been tried out in several forensic psychiatry institutes, the Cronbach \u03b1 of the scale is 0.93, and all items have high correlation with the total score of the scale (r=0.50-0.89). Two factors were extracted by the factorial analysis, and the cumulative squared loading was 68.62%. The scores of the three levels were 9.66 \u00b1 5.11, 26.54 \u00b1 5.21 and 40.08 \u00b1 7.90 respectively and highly significant differences were observed among groups. By establishing discrimination analysis among three levels, classification results suggested that 88.90% of the original grouped cases were correctly classified, and the discriminant value had high conformity with the experts' opinions. The data showed that the scale would be the best validated instrument for the criminal responsibility in China."}, {"Title": "Toward a more holistic understanding of filicide: a multidisciplinary analysis of 32 years of U.S. arrest data.", "Abstract": "Filicide is the killing of one or more children by a parent, stepparent, or other parental figure. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of U.S. filicide, drawn from 94,146 filicide arrests tabulated over a 32-year period in the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR). Filicides comprised 15% of all murders during this period. Modal victim age was less than one year old. One-third of the victims were under a year old; over two-thirds of the victims were age six or less. Fathers were as likely as mothers to kill infants. The mean age of offenders was 32 years with a mode of 22 years, and nearly three-quarters were aged 18-45. Female offenders were notably younger than their male counterparts. Black (or African American) offenders were significantly overrepresented in filicide compared to Whites. Most common killing methods included using hands and feet, strangulation, beating, asphyxiation, drowning, and defenestration. Stepparents were not at higher risk of filicide than genetic parents, but were twice as likely to kill using firearms. Synthesizing these results with studies from other fields, we propose three transdisciplinary, empirically informed filicide categories primarily defined by effects of (1) psychopathology associated with neurotransmitter disturbances, (2) gender and sex hormones, and (3) evolutionary motives. Approaching filicide using this proposed hypothetical framework for future research may help identify at-risk populations and improve prevention and treatment."}, {"Title": "Associations between DSM-IV mental disorders and subsequent self-reported diagnosis of cancer.", "Abstract": "The associations between mental disorders and cancer remain unclear. It is also unknown whether any associations vary according to life stage or gender. This paper examines these research questions using data from the World Mental Health Survey Initiative.\nThe World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview retrospectively assessed the lifetime prevalence of 16 DSM-IV mental disorders in face-to-face household population surveys in nineteen countries (n = 52,095). Cancer was indicated by self-report of diagnosis. Smoking was assessed in questions about current and past tobacco use. Survival analyses estimated associations between first onset of mental disorders and subsequently reported cancer.\nAfter adjustment for comorbidity, panic disorder, specific phobia and alcohol abuse were associated with a subsequently self-reported diagnosis of cancer. There was an association between number of mental disorders and the likelihood of reporting a cancer diagnosis following the onset of the mental disorder. This suggests that the associations between mental disorders and cancer risk may be generalised, rather than specific to a particular disorder. Depression is more strongly associated with self-reported cancers diagnosed early in life and in women. PTSD is also associated with cancers diagnosed early in life.\nThis study reports the magnitude of the associations between mental disorders and a self-reported diagnosis of cancer and provides information about the relevance of comorbidity, gender and the impact at different stages of life. The findings point to a link between the two conditions and lend support to arguments for early identification and treatment of mental disorders."}, {"Title": "The effectiveness of consultation-liaison psychiatry in the general hospital setting: a systematic review.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to review how the effectiveness of consultation liaison psychiatry (CLP) services has been measured and to evaluate the strength of the evidence for effectiveness.\nSystematic review of medical databases using broad search terms as well as expert opinion was sought. The literature search was restricted to studies of general, whole-of-hospital inpatient CLP services.\nForty articles were found and grouped into five measurements of effectiveness: cost effectiveness including length of stay, concordance, staff and patient feedback, and follow-up outcome studies. All measurements contributed to the evaluation of CLP services, but no one measure in isolation could adequately cover the multifaceted roles of CLP. Concordance was the only measurement with an established, consistent approach for evaluation. Cost effectiveness and follow-up outcome studies were the only measures with levels of evidence above four, however the three follow-up outcome studies reported conflicting results. Subjective evidence derived from patient and staff feedback is important but presently lacking due to methodological problems. The effectiveness of CLP services was demonstrated by cost-effectiveness, earlier referrals to CLP predicting shorter length of stay, and concordance with some management recommendations.\nThere is evidence that some CLP services are cost-effective and reduce length of stay when involved early and that referrers follow certain recommendations. However, many studies had disparate results and were methodologically flawed. Future research should focus on standardising patient and staff feedback, and short-term patient outcomes."}, {"Title": "Reflections on training in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "There is limited information as to whether graduates from postgraduate specialist medical training programmes in Australia and New Zealand feel prepared for practice, and none regarding the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists' (RANZCP) training programme.

Despite highlighting the impact of culture on psychiatric diagnosis and management in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5, most of the changes suggested remain in the introduction and appendices of the manual. Nevertheless, clinical and biological heterogeneity within phenomenological categories mandates the need to individualise care. However, social and cultural context, patient beliefs about causation, impact, treatment and outcome expectations are never systematically elicited, as they were not essential to diagnosis and classification. Patient experience and narratives are trivialised and the biomedical model is considered universal and transcendental. The need to elicit patient perspectives, evaluate local reality, assess culture, educate patients about possible interventions, and negotiate a shared plan of management between patient and clinician is cardinal for success. The biopsychosocial model, which operates within a paternalistic physician-patient relationship, needs to move towards a shared approach, within a more equal patient-clinician partnership."}, {"Title": "Understanding clinician perception of common presentations in South Asians seeking mental health treatment and determining barriers and facilitators to treatment.", "Abstract": "Little is known about the presentation of mental health symptoms among South Asians living in the US.\nTo explore mental health symptom presentation in South Asians in the US and to identify facilitators and barriers to treatment.\nFocus group study.\nFour focus groups were conducted with 7-8 participants in each group.

India's National Mental Health Program (NMHP) intended to attend to the mental health needs of all her citizens. Some aspects of this program bear significant resemblance to what recent experts in global mental health (GMH) have been proposing. The paper uses India as a country-level example to review and critically analyze the contextual background culminating in the formulation of the NMHP. Literature searches from two bibliographic databases (PubMed and Google Scholar) with supplementary searches and manual search from Indian Journal of Psychiatry were made relating to the context of formulation of India's NMHP. The search helped isolate 12 peer reviewed journal articles, three chapters from books, and one policy group approach paper. This literature has been synthesized to enumerate the various contextual factors. The present analysis identifies two vital factors relevant for international health, viz. the primary health care movement and the changing concepts of institutional care/de-institutionalization in mental health. This then puts in perspective the opportunities allowed and challenges produced, for NMHP, by subsequent changes in public health services in India. The lessons for GMH movement are then pointed out."}, {"Title": "Technological advances for deciphering the complexity of psychiatric disorders: merging proteomics with cell biology.", "Abstract": "Proteomic studies have increased our understanding of the molecular pathways affected in psychiatric disorders. Mass spectrometry and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analyses of post-mortem brain samples from psychiatric patients have revealed effects on synaptic, cytoskeletal, antioxidant and mitochondrial protein networks. Multiplex immunoassay profiling studies have found alterations in hormones, growth factors, transport and inflammation-related proteins in serum and plasma from living first-onset patients. Despite these advances, there are still difficulties in translating these findings into platforms for improved treatment of patients and for discovery of new drugs with better efficacy and side effect profiles. This review describes how the next phase of proteomic investigations in psychiatry should include stringent replication studies for validation of biomarker candidates and functional follow-up studies which can be used to test the impact on physiological function. All biomarker candidates should now be tested in series with traditional and emerging cell biological approaches. This should include investigations of the effects of post-translational modifications, protein dynamics and network analyses using targeted proteomic approaches. Most importantly, there is still an urgent need for development of disease-relevant cellular models for improved translation of proteomic findings into a means of developing novel drug treatments for patients with these life-altering disorders."}, {"Title": "Pharmacologic treatment of depression in the elderly.", "Abstract": "To discuss pharmacologic treatment of depression in the elderly, including choice of antidepressants, titration of dose, monitoring of response and side effects, and treatment of unresponsive cases.\nThe 2006 Canadian Coalition for Seniors' Mental Health guideline on the assessment and treatment of depression was used as a primary source. To identify articles published since the guideline, MEDLINE was searched from 2007 to 2012 using the terms depression, treatment, drug therapy, and elderly.\nThe goal of treatment should be remission of symptoms. Improvement of symptoms can be monitored by identifying patient goals or by use of a clinical tool such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Treatment should be considered in 3 phases: an acute treatment phase to achieve remission of symptoms, a continuation phase to prevent recurrence of the same episode of illness (relapse), and a maintenance (prophylaxis) phase to prevent future episodes (recurrence). Initial dosing should be half of the usual adult starting dose and be titrated regularly until the patient responds, until the maximum dose is reached, or until side effects limit further increases. Common side effects of medications include falls, nausea, dizziness, headaches, and, less commonly, hyponatremia and QT interval changes. Strategies for switching or augmenting antidepressants are discussed. Older patients should be treated for at least a year from when clinical improvement is noted, and those with recurrent depression or severe symptoms should continue treatment indefinitely. Treatment of specific situations such as severe depression or depression with psychosis is discussed, including the use of electroconvulsive therapy. Criteria for referral to geriatric psychiatry are provided; however, many family physicians do not have easy access to this resource or to other nonpharmacologic clinical strategies.\nThe effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment of depression is not substantially affected by age.

The challenges involved in implementing PRO measures are mostly the same regardless of aims and diagnostic groups and include logistic feasibility, high response rates, robustness, and ability to adapt to the needs of patient groups and settings. If generic PRO systems can adapt to specific needs, advanced technology can be shared between medical specialties and for different aims.\nWe describe methodological, organizational, and practical experiences with a generic PRO system, WestChronic, which is in use among a range of diagnostic groups and for a range of purposes.\nThe WestChronic system supports PRO data collection, with integration of Web and paper PRO questionnaires (mixed-mode) and automated procedures that enable adherence to implementation-specific schedules for the collection of PRO. For analysis, we divided functionalities into four elements: basic PRO data collection and logistics, PRO-based clinical decision support, PRO-based automated decision algorithms, and other forms of communication. While the first element is ubiquitous, the others are optional and only applicable at a patient level. Methodological and organizational experiences were described according to each element.\nWestChronic has, to date, been implemented in 22 PRO projects within 18 diagnostic groups, including cardiology, neurology, rheumatology, nephrology, orthopedic surgery, gynecology, oncology, and psychiatry. The aims of the individual projects included epidemiological research, quality improvement, hospital evaluation, clinical decision support, efficient use of outpatient clinic resources, and screening for side effects and comorbidity. In total 30,174 patients have been included, and 59,232 PRO assessments have been collected using 92 different PRO questionnaires. Response rates of up to 93% were achieved for first-round questionnaires and up to 99% during follow-up. For 6 diagnostic groups, PRO data were displayed graphically to the clinician to facilitate flagging of important symptoms and decision support, and in 5 diagnostic groups PRO data were used for automatic algorithm-based decisions.\nWestChronic has allowed the implementation of all proposed protocol for data collection and processing. The system has achieved high response rates, and longitudinal attrition is limited. The relevance of the questions, the mixed-mode principle, and automated procedures has contributed to the high response rates. Furthermore, development and implementation of a number of approaches and methods for clinical use of PRO has been possible without challenging the generic property.

Our objective was to describe facial self-mutilation in terms of its comorbidities, and to outline the different types of facial mutilation, as well as the basic approach to the patients with facial self-mutilation.\nWe undertook a review of all published cases of facial self-mutilation (1960-2011).\nWe identified 200 published cases in 123 relevant papers. Four major groups of comorbidities emerged: psychiatric, neurological and hereditary disorders, and a group of patients without identified comorbidities. There were three general patterns of facial self-mutilation: (1) major and definitive mutilation, with the ocular globe as primary target--seen in patients with psychotic disorders; (2) stereotypical mutilation involving the oral cavity and of variable degree of severity, most often seen in patients with hereditary neuropathy or encephalopathy; (3) mild chronic self-mutilation, seen in patients with non-psychotic psychiatric disorders, acquired neurological disorders, and patients without comorbidities. About 20% of patients that mutilated their face also mutilated extra-facial structures. Patients with psychiatric conditions, especially those with psychotic disorders, had significantly higher (p<0.05) rates of permanent facial self-mutilation than others. Most treatment plans were very individually based, but some principles, such as prevention of irreversible loss of function and structure, or development of infection are applicable to all patients with facial self-mutilation.\nFacial self-mutilation is a potentially severe manifestation of diverse conditions.

Approximately 15% to 20% of older adults experience unintentional weight loss and require intervention to maintain quality of life. Currently, there are no pharmacologic agents indicated to treat unintentional weight loss in older adults; however, several medications may aid by stimulating appetite and/or promoting weight gain. In recent years, mirtazapine has gained attention not only for its antidepressant effects, but also for its potential benefits in underweight patients. This agent has been found to increase appetite and weight in adults compared with placebo and other antidepressants, but further clinical investigation is necessary to determine the role of mirtazapine in the older underweight population."}, {"Title": "[Pseudodementia, what are we talking about? Part I: In search of Wernicke's pseudodementia].", "Abstract": "The authors explore the history of pseudodementia in the elderly; an issue with growing momentum in a world where life duration expectancy has been constantly growing and the management and treatments of dementias has imposed an equally increasing burden. Although the issue is mainly therapeutic, some of the main tenets of the current approaches rest heavily on historical issues. The invention of the term pseudodementia (Pseudodemenz) is usually credited to Wernicke. However, the exact circumstances and the debates that have accompanied the emergence of the term have never been fully uncovered, and the references are not accurate. Most of the recent literature cites Kiloh as the key influence in structuring the current uses of the term, but the relationship between both sources is not clear.\nA research of anteriority has been conducted on the basis of Medline via Pubmed, PsychINFO and google book, using the following keywords: pseudodementia, pseudodementia, depressive pseudodementia, pseudod\u00e9mence, Pseudodemenz. We have researched the quotations to localize the origin of the concept. Complementarily, we have attempted to clarify the nature of the debates by exploring the relevant German psychiatric literature at the end of the XIXth century and the beginning of the XXth.\nWe have found that the very first occurrences of the notion appeared in a debate between the following authors: Ganser S.J.M. 1898, 1903; Wernicke C. 1898; Raecke J. 1901; Nissl F. 1902; Jung C.G. 1902, 1903; Stertz G. 1910; Bonhoeffer K. 1911; Schuppius S. 1914. We found that the term Pseudodemenz never appears in Wernicke's written works, although he was credited of its invention by his most direct students. It seems that the term was thought by the time it emerged to have originated in Wernicke's discussion of Ganser's syndrome.\nGanser's syndrome, often defined as carceral psychosis, is a specific hysterical twilight state characterized by \"talking past the point\" (Vorbeireden), amnesia and hysterical stigmas, in which some trauma was thought to be causative. Wernicke presented it as determined by a \"restriction of the field of consciousness\", echoing Janet's theory (\u00c9cole de la Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re). He rejected the twilight characteristic: this differential point seems to have initiated the introduction of the concept of pseudodementia. Raecke argued that such states should not be understood as forms of simulation thus contributing to a heated debate of the time. Referring to Janet's works and expanding the syndrome of \"traumatic hysteria\", he argued in favor of a specific inhibiting factor which disturbs the process of associations. Jung, refusing Nissl's article dismissing Ganser, Wernicke and Raecke's views, confirmed the hysterical hypothesis. In a new contribution to the debate, Ganser contested Wernicke's differential point, arguing that in Vorbeireden, there was a Benommenheit - some sort of giddiness - and a \"superficiality of the contents of consciousness\" rather than a limitation of consciousness. It has been rightly argued that Wernicke's view of the pseudodementia issues was mainly related to the debates on hysteria and trauma, and that no relationship with old age symptomatology was established by him. However, we have found that he alluded to at least one case in which such a relationship was hypothesized. Moreover, one should note that Wernicke's views on hysteria included the rather pervasive notion of \"hysterical psychosis\", exhibiting \"allopsychosis\", which could include what would nowadays be seen as schizophrenia or psychotic mood disorders.\nFirst of all, the term Pseudodemenz, if it was ever used by Wernicke verbally, never appears in his published works. Besides, the debates concerning Ganser's syndrome, which served as a first paradigm to discuss pseudodementia, were highly influenced by the discussions on traumatic disorders, hysteria and simulation. Finally, although no direct connection is made between disorders of the senium and Pseudodemenz, the fact that Wernicke included both in what he termed \"allopsychic disorders\" seemed to indicate that some kind of relationship could not be absolutely excluded in Wernicke's mind."}, {"Title": "A short history of the notion of neurodegenerative disease.", "Abstract": "The notion of heredity of degenerative constitutions of human beings contributed in the nineteenth century to the fear for deterioration of the human race and in the twentieth century to attempts by several Western Countries, particularly Germany, to improve the inborn qualities of their populations by eugenic measures. In the years following World War II, the term eugenics was eradicated from medicine. The qualification degenerative disappeared from genetics and psychiatry but remained in use to denote decay of tissues and cells. The adjective neurodegenerative came in vogue in neurology and was mostly applied to brain diseases. Definitions in the literature indicate that neurodegenerative diseases are considered as to be age related, incurable, and largely untreatable chronic progressive diseases of the central nervous system. Scrutiny of available data shows that the notion concerns an ill-defined group of genetic and idiopathic disorders. Genetic central nervous system diseases may become manifest at all ages and are accessible for symptomatic treatment. Investigations of animal models suggest that not all neurodegenerative diseases are inherently incurable. Alternatives for the terms neurodegenerative and degenerative are available."}, {"Title": "Scanning fast and slow: current limitations of 3 Tesla functional MRI and future potential.", "Abstract": "Functional MRI at 3T has become a workhorse for the neurosciences, e.g., neurology, psychology, and psychiatry, enabling non-invasive investigation of brain function and connectivity. However, BOLD-based fMRI is a rather indirect measure of brain function, confounded by physiology related signals, e.g., head or brain motion, brain pulsation, blood flow, intermixed with susceptibility differences close or distant to the region of neuronal activity. Even though a plethora of preprocessing strategies have been published to address these confounds, their efficiency is still under discussion. In particular, physiological signal fluctuations closely related to brain supply may mask BOLD signal changes related to \"true\" neuronal activation. Here we explore recent technical and methodological advancements aimed at disentangling the various components, employing fast multiband vs. standard EPI, in combination with fast temporal ICA. Our preliminary results indicate that fast (<i>TR</i> <0.5 s) scanning may help to identify and eliminate physiologic components, increasing tSNR and functional contrast. In addition, biological variability can be studied and task performance better correlated to other measures. This should increase specificity and reliability in fMRI studies. Furthermore, physiological signal changes during scanning may then be recognized as a source of information rather than a nuisance. As we are currently still undersampling the complexity of the brain, even at a rather coarse macroscopic level, we should be very cautious in the interpretation of neuroscientific findings, in particular when comparing different groups (e.g., age, sex, medication, pathology, etc.). From a technical point of view our goal should be to sample brain activity at layer specific resolution with low TR, covering as much of the brain as possible without violating SAR limits. We hope to stimulate discussion toward a better understanding and a more quantitative use of fMRI."}, {"Title": "Treatment and Control: A Qualitative Study of Older Mentally Ill Offenders' Perceptions on Their Detention and Care Trajectory.", "Abstract": "The life of older mentally ill offenders (OMIOs) is often characterized by successive periods of detention in correctional facilities, admissions to psychiatric services, and unsuccessful attempts to live independently. Through in-depth interviews, eight personal stories from OMIOs under supervision of the commission of social defence in Ghent (Belgium) were analyzed in the phenomenological research tradition. The results of the study reveal that OMIOs had more positive and less negative experiences in prison settings when compared with other institutional care settings. Independent living, unsurprisingly, is favored the most. This may be due to the fact that the latter option fosters personal competence, feelings of being useful, personal choices, and contact with the \"outside\" world. Even in later lifetime, a combined approach of risk assessment with improvement of well-being remains valuable to stimulate offender rehabilitation. Therefore, more research into concepts that could be used to support OMIOs needs further consideration."}, {"Title": "The definition of mental disorder: evolving but dysfunctional?", "Abstract": "Extensive and diverse conceptual work towards developing a definition of 'mental disorder' was motivated by the declassification of homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. This highly politicised event was understood as a call for psychiatry to provide assurances against further misclassification on the basis of discrimination or socio-political deviance. Today, if a definition of mental disorder fails to exclude homosexuality, then it fails to provide this safeguard against potential abuses and therefore fails to do an important part of the work it was intended to do. We argue that fact-based definitions of mental disorder, relying on scientific theory, fail to offer a robust definition of mental disorder that excludes homosexuality. Definitions of mental disorder based on values do not fare better: these definitions are silent on questions about the diagnostic status of individuals in oppressive societies and over-inclusive of mental or behavioural states that happen to be negatively valued in the individual's social context. We consider the latest definition proposed for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5) in light of these observations. We argue that definition fails to improve on these earlier deficiencies. Its inclusion in the manual may offer false reassurance against repetition of past misclassifications. We conclude with a provocation that if candidate definitions of mental disorder are unable to exclude homosexuality, it might perhaps be preferable not to attempt a definition at all."}, {"Title": "The socio-demographic characteristics and patterns of help-seeking among patients with schizophrenia in south-east Nigeria.", "Abstract": "A large proportion of psychiatric patients in Nigeria seek help from other sources which ultimately lead to treatment delay.

Positive treatment outcome has been reported, for instance in double blind, multi-center studies on depression. Nonetheless, the application of TMS towards studying and treating brain disorders is still limited by inter-subject variability and lack of model systems accessible to TMS. The latter are required to obtain a deeper understanding of the biophysical foundations of TMS so that the stimulus protocol can be optimized for maximal brain response, while inter-subject variability hinders precise and reliable delivery of stimuli across subjects. Recent studies showed that both of these limitations are in part due to the angular sensitivity of TMS. Thus, a technique that would eradicate the need for precise angular orientation of the coil would improve both the inter-subject reliability of TMS and its effectiveness in model systems. We show here how rotation of the stimulating field relieves the angular sensitivity of TMS and provides improvements in both issues. Field rotation is attained by superposing the fields of two coils positioned orthogonal to each other and operated with a relative phase shift in time. Rotating field TMS (rfTMS) efficiently stimulates both cultured hippocampal networks and rat motor cortex, two neuronal systems that are notoriously difficult to excite magnetically. This opens the possibility of pharmacological and invasive TMS experiments in these model systems. Application of rfTMS to human subjects overcomes the orientation dependence of standard TMS. Thus, rfTMS yields optimal targeting of brain regions where correct orientation cannot be determined (e.g., via motor feedback) and will enable stimulation in brain regions where a preferred axonal orientation does not exist."}, {"Title": "European Psychiatric Association (EPA) guidance on post-graduate psychiatric training in Europe.", "Abstract": "The European Union Free Movement Directive gives professionals the opportunity to work and live within the European Union, but does not give specific requirements regarding how the specialists in medicine have to be trained, with the exception of a required minimum of 4\u00a0years of education.

Pharmacological treatment of prevalent symptoms like anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance can contribute to the high chemical burden already carried by cancer patients, creating additional side effects. As a result, patients and providers alike are interested in evidence-based nonpharmacologic alternatives like acupuncture for these symptoms. This article reviews the current literature (January 2000 through April 2013) for acupuncture in cancer-related psychological symptoms with attention to both efficacy and acupuncture-specific methodology. All published studies that met our review criteria demonstrate a positive signal for acupuncture for the treatment of depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and for improving quality of life with most results showing statistical significance. However, there are only a handful of acupuncture studies that were specifically designed to evaluate depression, sleep disturbance, and quality of life as primary outcomes, and no studies were found that looked at anxiety as a primary outcome in this population. Published studies in cancer patients and survivors show that acupuncture treatment is not only safe but also more acceptable with fewer side effects than standard of care pharmacological treatments like antidepressants. Finally, there is wide variability in both the implementation and reporting of acupuncture methods in the literature, with only 2 of 12 studies reporting full details of acupuncture methods as outlined in the revised Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture guidelines, published in 2010 and providing an essential framework for the reporting of acupuncture methodology. This lack of methodological detail affects outcomes, generalizability, and validity of research involving acupuncture. Reasons for ongoing challenges in the development of high-quality acupuncture trials are discussed. In conclusion, results are encouraging for the development of randomized trials to directly evaluate the therapeutic impact of acupuncture in cancer-related psychological symptoms, including depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and quality of life, but attention to acupuncture methodological specific challenges in the development of high-quality research is necessary."}, {"Title": "Targeted research training: developing minority psychiatric investigators.", "Abstract": "The primary purpose of this article is to review the career outcomes of a research training program specifically targeted to young psychiatric researchers from minority populations underrepresented in psychiatry.

This course was taken up well by the residents, with overall feedback significantly more positive than that prior to the course revision.\nThis \"proof of concept\" neuroscience course illustrates a potential route for bridging between rapid advances in psychiatric neuroscience and the clinical education for trainees not otherwise versed in neuroscience but who are needed for scientific advances to translate to the clinic. The promise of this approach may be in part related to the similarity between this framework and problem-based approaches common in routine clinical care. In such approaches, clinicians focus on the expressed complaints of their individual patient and identify specific symptoms as the target of treatment--symptoms which are presumably the expression of dysfunction in specific brain systems."}, {"Title": "Global mental health reforms: Challenges in developing a community-based program for maltreated children and adolescents in Brazil.", "Abstract": "This column describes the planning and development of The Equilibrium Program (TEP) for multiply traumatized and neglected children and adolescents with mental and general medical problems in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.

GPs responded by claiming to understand the emotions or by formulating the patients' statements, but without further exploring the emotions.\nGPs displayed a greater engagement with patients' emotions than psychiatrists. Their approach could be described as empathic, corresponding to a mentalizing stance. The different approaches taken by psychiatrists could represent conceptual differences and might affect fruitful interdisciplinary work. Psychiatric nurses' responses to patients' emotions must also be studied to complete our knowledge from psychiatry.\nExperiences from training in mentalization could be used to develop physicians' empathic or mentalizing approach. As most patients with depression are treated in primary care, developing GPs' mentalizing capacity instead of offering didactic training could have a substantial effect in the population."}, {"Title": "Temperament and character and psychopathy in male conduct disordered offenders.", "Abstract": "Adult male offenders with high psychopathy scores are characterized by high Novelty Seeking, low Harm Avoidance and low Cooperativeness; temperament and character traits that may moderate treatment outcomes. This is the first study to investigate if a similar profile is present in juveniles. One hundred and twenty two incarcerated juvenile male offenders who met the criteria for conduct disorder in the absence of current psychiatric disorder (e.g. psychosis, depression, anxiety) were rated on the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and the Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL: YV). PCL: YV total score was positively correlated with Novelty Seeking but negatively correlated with Cooperativeness and Harm Avoidance. Examination of the PCL: YV facets indicated a significant negative correlation between Harm Avoidance and PCL: YV Interpersonal and PCL: YV Antisocial; and Reward Dependence and Cooperativeness and PCL: YV Lifestyle/Behavioral. Relationships were primarily with lifestyle/behavioral and antisocial facets of psychopathy. The TCI profile resembles that seen in adult offenders and has implications for treatment as low cooperativeness and reward dependency are likely to be key responsivity factors that need to be addressed in treatment planning."}, {"Title": "Platelet serotonin concentration and clinical status in alcohol withdrawal syndrome, preliminary results.", "Abstract": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is an important problem for management of alcoholism. It is known that alcohol alters the function of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, but our review found no studies associating serotonin concentration changes with patient clinical status during detoxification. The authors hypothesized that total platelet serotonin concentration should significantly increase during alcohol detoxification.\nAssess possible association between total (endogenous and captured) platelet serotonin concentration and clinical status of patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome, at beginning and end of detoxification with clomethiazole.\nThirty-one alcohol-dependent patients, diagnosed with alcohol withdrawal syndrome according to DSM-IV and classified in three clinical groups (18-20, 21-22 and 23-26 points) per the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, were included in a prospective case series from May 2009 through May 2011 at the Hermanos Ameijeiras Clinical-Surgical Teaching Hospital in Cuba. Patients were predominantly male (87%), ranging in age from 22 to 57 years; 40% were white, 40% mestizo and 20% black. All had been hospitalized for detoxification in the hospital's psychiatry service. Blood samples taken were mixed with 1% EDTA and centrifuged for isolating platelets. Serotonin concentrations (endogenous and captured) were measured within 2 hours of blood collection and mean values at treatment days 1 and 12 compared by t test (p <0.05).\nTotal serotonin concentration mean values (\u00b5g of serotonin per mg of total platelet protein) were statistically different between days 1 and 12 of treatment (1.329\u00b10.916 \u00b5g/mg vs. 2.573\u00b11.224 \u00b5g/mg; p <0.001). There was a direct association between total serotonin concentration and patient clinical classification both initially and at day 12. At day 1, the 29 patients in the group with 18-20 points had mean serotonin of 1.358\u00b10.0.94 \u00b5g/mg; one patient with 21 points had serotonin of 1.25 \u00b5g/mg; and one patient with 24 points had serotonin of 0.740 \u00b5g/mg. At day 12, 26 patients had 0-1 points, with mean serotonin 2.688\u00b11.244 \u00b5g/mg; and 5 patients had 2-8 points, with mean serotonin 1.244\u00b10.596 \u00b5g/mg. No patient had >8 points at day 12.\nSerotonin is a potential biomarker for initial clinical classification and outcome monitoring and could be useful to psychiatrists working with patients in this area of medical practice and research.

European psychiatry has been sleeping since 1980.", "Abstract": "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III), published in 1980, has led to a dead end, the DSM-V. Following the allegory of Sleeping Beauty, the DSM-III put European psychiatry to sleep; it now must wake up to create a 21st century psychiatric language for descriptive psychopathology and psychiatric nosology. Four topics are reviewed. First, the review of descriptive psychopathology focuses on: a) Chaslin's and Jaspers's books, and b) Schneider's transmittal of Jaspers's ideas and involvement with Kraepelin in incorporating neuroscience into psychiatric nosology. Second, US psychiatry's historic steps include: a) the pseudoscience of psychoanalysis, b) the low level of pre-DSM-III diagnostic expertise, c) the neo-Kraepelinian revolution which led to DSM-III, d) the failure to improve diagnostic skills, and e) the reprise of Kraepelin's marketing (\"neuroscience will save psychiatry\"). Third, the DSM-III devastated European psychiatry by destroying: a) the national textbooks which increased consistency but eliminated creative European thinking; and b) the Arbeitsgemenschaft fur Methodic und Dokumentation in der Psychiatrie, the most reasonable attempt to reach diagnostic agreement: start with symptoms/signs (first level) rather than disorders (second level).

Self-stigma is among the psychological challenges that can be exacerbated by intrinsic and/or extrinsic factors. Caregivers' self-stigma can negatively influence the patients' treatment and rehabilitation process. The objective of this study was to measure the level and correlates of self-stigma among caregivers of people with mental illness.\nAn interviewer-administered cross-sectional study was conducted in the Jimma University Specialized Hospital Psychiatry Clinic in Ethiopia on a sample of 422 caregivers. Data were collected by trained nurses working in the clinic using a pretested questionnaire. Multivariate linear regression was performed to identify the correlates of self-stigma among caregivers of people with mental illness.\nThe majority (70.38%) of the caregivers were male. On a scale of 0 to 15, with 0 being low and 15 being high, the average self-stigmatizing attitude score was 4.68 (\u00b14.11). A statistically significant difference in mean self-stigma score was found between urban and rural respondents (t=3.95, P<0.05). Self-stigma of caregivers showed significant positive correlation with perceived signs of mental illness (r=0.18, P<0.001), perceived supernatural explanations of mental illness (r=0.26, P<0.001), and perceived psychosocial and biological explanations of mental illness (r=0.12, P<0.01). The only independent predictor of caregivers' self-stigma was perceived supernatural explanation of mental illness (standardized \u03b2=0.22, P<0.001).\nThe tendency of caregivers to avoid being identified with the patients was observed. Low exposure to mental health information was also reported. Caregivers' self-stigma in this study was significantly correlated with perceived supernatural explanation of mental illness. Since caregivers' self-stigma may negatively influence patients' treatment-seeking, adherence, and rehabilitation processes, programs that enhance coping strategies by strengthening self-esteem and empowerment by health care providers and establish family support groups may be helpful to tackle self-stigma among caregivers of people with mental illness."}, {"Title": "On the prescribing analyst.", "Abstract": "The value of medication for some patients in psychoanalysis serves to highlight the potential challenges of the medical analyst and invites exploration into possible motivations for assuming the prescribing role.

Jaspers, Schneider, and Mayer-Gross were members of the Heidelberg school. General Psychopathology, indirectly through Schneider's and Mayer-Gross' textbooks and directly by its English translation in 1963, led to a narrow set of schizophrenia criteria in the United Kingdom. General Psychopathology had very limited direct impact on US psychiatry, which adopted a broader schizophrenia definition. The difference between UK and US schizophrenia was a key element in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, and the neo-Kraepelinian revolution. General Psychopathology contains two essential interrelated ideas: a) psychiatry is a hybrid scientific discipline that must combine natural and social science methods that provide an explanation of illness that follows the medical model and an understanding of psychiatric abnormalities that are variations of human living, respectively, and b) psychiatric disorders are heterogeneous. Berrios' ideas on the hybridity of psychiatry in the United Kingdom and McHugh's ideas on psychiatric diagnoses in the United States can be considered neo-Jasperian approaches because they further elaborate these two Jasperian concepts in the late 20th century."}, {"Title": "When surgeons decide to become surgeons: new opportunities for surgical education.", "Abstract": "When surgeons decide to become surgeons has important implications. If the decision is made prior to or early in medical school, surgical education can be more focused on surgical diseases and resident skills.\nTo determine when surgeons - compared with their nonsurgical colleagues - decide on their medical path, residents in surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, and emergency medicine were surveyed. Timing of residency choice, demographic data, personal goals, and reason for residency choice were queried.\nA total of 234 residents responded (53 surgical residents). Sixty-two percent of surgeons reported that they were \"fairly certain\" of surgery before medical school, 13% decided during their preclinical years, and 25% decided during their clerkship years. This compares with an aggregate 40%, 7%, and 54%, respectively, for the other 5 residency specialties. These differences were statistically significant (P = .001). When the 234 residents were asked about their primary motivation for choosing their field, 51% pointed to expected job satisfaction and 44% to intellectual curiosity, and only 3% mentioned lifestyle, prestige, or income.\nGeneral surgery residents decide on surgery earlier than residents in other programs. This may be advantageous, resulting in fast-tracking of these medical students in acquiring surgical knowledge, undertaking surgical research, and early identification for surgical residency programs. Surgical training in the era of the 80-hour work week could be enhanced if medical students bring much deeper knowledge of surgery to their first day of residency."}, {"Title": "Antipsychotic dosing: found in translation.", "Abstract": "In the field of schizophrenia research, as in other areas of psychiatry, there is a sense of frustration that greater advances have not been made over the years, calling into question existing research strategies.

There are exceptions; for example, we would argue that different lines of preclinical and clinical research have substantially altered how we look at antipsychotic dosing. While this story remains a work in progress, advances \"found in translation\" have played an important role.

The Staging Health Risk Assessment, the primary measure used in this study, screened for risk status and readiness to change 11 health behaviors, referencing the period prior to acute hospitalization.\nParticipants averaged 5.2 (SD = 2.1) risk behaviors, including smoking (100%), high-fat diet (68%), inadequate fruits/vegetables (67%), poor sleep (53%), physical inactivity (52%), and marijuana use (46%). The percent prepared to change ranged from 23% for tobacco and marijuana to 76% for depression management. Latent class analysis differentiated three risk groups: the global higher risk group included patients elevated on all risk behaviors; the global lower risk group was low on all risks; and a mood and metabolic risk group, characterized by inactivity, unhealthy diet, sleep problems, and poor stress and depression management. The global higher risk group (11% of sample) was younger, largely male, and had the greatest number of risk behaviors and mental health diagnoses; had the most severe psychopathologies, addiction-treatment histories, and nicotine dependence; and the lowest confidence for quitting smoking and commitment to abstinence.\nMost smokers with SMI engaged in multiple risks.

Endophenotypes may improve our power to detect genes influencing risk of illness by being genetically simpler, closer to the level of gene action, and with larger genetic effect sizes or by providing added statistical power through their ability to quantitatively rank people within diagnostic categories. Furthermore, they also provide insight into the mechanisms underlying illness and will be valuable in developing biologically-based nosologies, through efforts such as RDoC, that seek to explain both the heterogeneity within current diagnostic categories and the overlapping clinical features between them. While neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and cognitive measures are currently most used in psychiatric genetic studies, researchers currently are attempting to identify candidate endophenotypes that are less genetically complex and potentially closer to the level of gene action, such as transcriptomic and proteomic phenotypes. Sifting through tens of thousands of such measures requires automated, high-throughput ways of assessing, and ranking potential endophenotypes, such as the Endophenotype Ranking Value. However, despite the potential utility of endophenotypes for gene characterization and discovery, there is considerable resistance to endophenotypic approaches in psychiatry. In this review, we address and clarify some of the common issues associated with the usage of endophenotypes in the psychiatric genetics community."}, {"Title": "Impact of the psychiatry clerkship on medical student attitudes towards psychiatry and to psychiatry as a career.", "Abstract": "The psychiatry clerkship forms part of the core curriculum of medical schools worldwide and provides psychiatric educators with an ideal opportunity to positively influence students.

The following key search words were used to search a number of electronic databases: medical student/s, attitude/s, psychiatry and clerkship. Studies published in the English language from 1990 to the present were included. Studies were included if they were based on a pre-/post-design, i.e. the same students must have participated in the study both before and after the clerkship.\nTwenty-six studies from 19 countries were identified for the review. Sixteen studies reported an overall improvement in attitudes towards psychiatry post-clerkship, and ten found no change in attitudes. In terms of career choice, nine studies reported an increase in the number of students interested in psychiatry as a career post-clerkship, nine found no impact on career choice and, in eight studies, it was not assessed. A number of positive and negative factors regarding the clerkship were identified.\nOverall, the psychiatry clerkship has a positive impact on students' attitudes towards psychiatry, but does not improve interest in psychiatry as a career option. For those students particularly interested in psychiatry, the challenge is to maintain their enthusiasm post-clerkship. Charismatic teachers, mentorship and stigma reduction may be effective strategies.

Compared to physical aggression, systematic studies on verbal aggression are lacking.A qualitative focus group study was conducted in several clinical settings in north-western Germany: acute mental health care, forensic mental health care, children and adolescent psychiatry, residential care for mentally ill persons, general hospital, and nursing home. 74 staff members from various professions participated in 8 focus groups.Various forms of verbal aggression were reported, from verbal abuse over threats to non-compliant behaviour. Backgrounds for verbal aggression by patients were usually non-satisfaction with the situation or the treatment, organisational problems, and mental disorders. Staff reported about various coping strategies such as ignorance and rationalisation, but also helplessness. Compared to physical aggression, the severity of verbal aggression was rated non-uniformly. A clear boundary between verbal aggression and 'normal' speech acts could not be drawn, as subjective and individual factors play an important role while interpreting aggressive acts.Verbal aggression is a relevant stressor for health-care staff which has been widely neglected in care institutions.

The trial considered whether clinical reflection groups following the Balint process would be perceived as useful and relevant to the learning needs of the student participants.\nA grounded theory approach was undertaken. This included survey data, thematic analysis of written feedback, and facilitator reflection on the process. Facilitators adapted the group process in response to participants' needs. These modifications included: increased education regarding the Balint process; the introduction of co-presenters; and the inclusion of a didactic summary following each session.\nThe evaluation suggested that fidelity of the Balint group experience was achieved and that student attitudes were neutral to mildly positive regarding the educational experience.\nBalint groups are potentially useful to medical students in the Australian context. We suggest that Balint groups may be more useful when applied in less alienating learning environments, such as during general practice rotations.

Medical treatment modalities will be required to adjust for diversity of social and cultural background. Initiated by the Federal Society of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (BKJPP), representing mainly those psychiatrists working in private practice, and by the Federal Working Commission of Medical Directors employed in Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics (BAG), a questionnaire was constructed to identify mental health professionals' (psychiatrists') evaluation of the needs and quality of diagnosis and treatment for migrant families. The current study focused on medical directors and deputy chief physicians in clinics for child and adolescent psychiatry. Preliminary results of this survey - implementing descriptive statistics as well as univariate and multivariate statistical analyses - permitted an assessment of the current state of identification and treatment of migrant offspring attending child and adolescent psychiatric practices in Germany. Recommendations and concrete steps are offered, which aim to promote \"cultural opening\", and assist in health and social policy makers' decisions for improved mental health care."}, {"Title": "Can transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) alleviate symptoms and improve cognition in psychiatric disorders?", "Abstract": "Since the discovery of psychopharmacological treatments in the early 1950s, followed by the development of second-generation antidepressants and antipsychotics, biological psychiatry has not achieved much progress. Recent technological advances in the field of non-invasive brain stimulation open new perspectives in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Amongst them, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates cortical excitability and induces long-lasting effects. Here, we aimed at evaluating whether tDCS has potential to be developed as an innovative treatment in psychiatry.\nWe conducted a systematic review of the current state of development and application of tDCS in psychiatric disorders, exploring clinical and cognitive effects, especially in major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia and substance use disorder.\nSystematic literature search yielded 40 publications: 22 in MDD, nine in schizophrenia, seven in substance use disorder, one in obsessive-compulsive disorder and one in mania. Our findings indicated beneficial clinical effects of tDCS for MDD and a promising literature in schizophrenia and substance use disorder.\nDespite methodological differences, the data published to date are promising and supports the use of tDCS as a treatment for psychiatric disorders. However, its place regarding other treatments still has to be determined before becoming a routine clinical treatment."}, {"Title": "Eugene Irvine Taylor Jr. (1946-2013).", "Abstract": "Eugene Irvine Taylor Jr. was born on October 28, 1946 and died on January 30, 2013.

Since 2013, there is the possibility of voluntary participation in the new system. Valid from 2015, every other institution will have to deal with the new challenges, opportunities and risks coming along with the structural changes, even though this fact will not have any impact on the individual hospital revenue budget until the end of 2016. There is still some time left to get used to the new system. This paper summarises the key data on the new reimbursement system and explains its content as well as how it works.

Guidelines for safe and ethical conduct of such procedures have previously and independently been proposed by various local and regional expert groups.\nTo expand on these earlier documents, representative members of continental and international psychiatric and neurosurgical societies, joined efforts to further elaborate and adopt a pragmatic worldwide set of guidelines. These are intended to address a broad range of neuropsychiatric disorders, brain targets and neurosurgical techniques, taking into account cultural and social heterogeneities of healthcare environments.\nThe proposed consensus document highlights that, while stereotactic ablative procedures such as cingulotomy and capsulotomy for depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder are considered 'established' in some countries, they still lack level I evidence. Further, it is noted that deep brain stimulation in any brain target hitherto tried, and for any psychiatric or behavioural disorder, still remains at an investigational stage. Researchers are encouraged to design randomised controlled trials, based on scientific and data-driven rationales for disease and brain target selection. Experienced multidisciplinary teams are a mandatory requirement for the safe and ethical conduct of any psychiatric neurosurgery, ensuring documented refractoriness of patients, proper consent procedures that respect patient's capacity and autonomy, multifaceted preoperative as well as postoperative long-term follow-up evaluation, and reporting of effects and side effects for all patients.\nThis consensus document on ethical and scientific conduct of psychiatric surgery worldwide is designed to enhance patient safety."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric disorders in people with intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder): forensic aspects.", "Abstract": "Persons with intellectual disability come into frequent and underreported contact with the legal system.

A Personality Disorder Characteristics Checklist allows screening for personality disorders (indicative of increased risk of violence) among intellectual disability offenders. Referrals to specialists for treatment more often occur for violent and sexual offenses than for other offenses. Competence restoration is historically low among those with intellectual disability, specially compared with those referred for substance abuse and personality disorders.

The authors examined resting hippocampal activity in schizophrenia patients and healthy comparison subjects and analyzed the relationship between intrinsic hippocampal activity and cognitive function in patients as measured by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB).\nTwenty-eight schizophrenia patients and 28 age-matched healthy comparison subjects underwent functional \"resting state\" 3-T MR scanning. Hippocampal activity was extracted by group independent component analysis. Correlation analyses were used to examine the relationship between hippocampal activity and MCCB composite and domain scores in patients, as well as between hippocampal activity and positive and negative symptoms.\nGreater activity of the right hippocampus at rest was observed in patients relative to comparison subjects. In patients, a significant negative correlation was observed between right hippocampal activity and composite MCCB T-score. The correlation was driven by the MCCB domains of attention/vigilance, working memory, and visual learning. Hippocampal activity was positively correlated with negative symptoms. MCCB scores were inversely correlated with negative symptoms.\nThese findings suggest that greater intrinsic hippocampal activity is a characteristic feature of schizophrenia that is broadly associated with cognitive dysfunction, and they support hippocampal activity as a candidate biomarker for therapeutic development."}, {"Title": "The effect of nurse-led motivational interviewing on medication adherence in patients with bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to test the effect of motivational interviewing (MI) on medication adherence in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) in an outpatient setting.\nPretest-posttest design was used.

Patients admitted with rhabdomyolysis and taking an antipsychotic from January 2009 to October 2011 were included. Background demographics, laboratory data, medical and physical history, concomitant medications, and hospital course data were collected. Of the 673 cases admitted with rhabdomyolysis, 71 (10.5%) were on an antipsychotic. This is significantly greater when compared to the general US population, where only 1.3% of individuals take an antipsychotic drug (P < .0001). Cause of rhabdomyolysis was not documented in 38% of cases, and antipsychotic use was suspected in 10% of cases. No significant correlations were found between antipsychotic type and other patient-specific parameters. Seventeen (25%) of these patients were taking 2 or more antipsychotics. The largest percentage was on quetiapine (Seroquel(\u00ae); AstraZeneca, Wilmington, Delaware), the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic in the United States. Antipsychotic use is a risk factor for rhabdomyolysis and seems to be more common in those taking multiple agents.

Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify the class structure underpinning DMC data and also items for a brief subtyping scale. The concordance of the abbreviated scale was then compared with the original Delirium Motor Subtype Scale (DMSS) in 375 patients having delirium as per the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (4th edition) criteria.\nLatent class analysis identified four classes that corresponded closely with the four recognized motor subtypes of delirium. Further, LCA of items (n = 15) that loaded >60% to the model identified four features that reliably identified the classes/subtypes, and these were combined as a brief motor subtyping scale (DMSS-4). There was good concordance for subtype attribution between the original DMSS and the DMSS-4 (\u03ba = 0.63).\nThe DMSS-4 allows for rapid assessment of clinical subtypes in delirium and has high concordance with the longer and well-validated DMSS.

Contemporary psychiatry, which neglects dreams, has been criticized for lack of objectivity. In search of quantitative insight into the structure of psychotic speech, we investigated speech graph attributes (SGA) in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder type I, and non-psychotic controls as they reported waking and dream contents. Schizophrenic subjects spoke with reduced connectivity, in tight correlation with negative and cognitive symptoms measured by standard psychometric scales. Bipolar and control subjects were undistinguishable by waking reports, but in dream reports bipolar subjects showed significantly less connectivity. Dream-related SGA outperformed psychometric scores or waking-related data for group sorting. Altogether, the results indicate that online and offline processing, the two most fundamental modes of brain operation, produce nearly opposite effects on recollections: While dreaming exposes differences in the mnemonic records across individuals, waking dampens distinctions. The results also demonstrate the feasibility of the differential diagnosis of psychosis based on the analysis of dream graphs, pointing to a fast, low-cost and language-invariant tool for psychiatric diagnosis and the objective search for biomarkers.

As our knowledge of the human microbiome increases, including its connection to mental health (for example, anxiety and depression), it is becoming increasingly clear that there are untold connections between our resident microbes and many aspects of physiology. Of relevance to this research are new findings concerning the ways in which fermentation alters dietary items pre-consumption, and in turn, the ways in which fermentation-enriched chemicals (for example, lactoferrin, bioactive peptides) and newly formed phytochemicals (for example, unique flavonoids) may act upon our own intestinal microbiota profile. Here, we argue that the consumption of fermented foods may be particularly relevant to the emerging research linking traditional dietary practices and positive mental health. The extent to which traditional dietary items may mitigate inflammation and oxidative stress may be controlled, at least to some degree, by microbiota. It is our contention that properly controlled fermentation may often amplify the specific nutrient and phytochemical content of foods, the ultimate value of which may associated with mental health; furthermore, we also argue that the microbes (for example, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria species) associated with fermented foods may also influence brain health via direct and indirect pathways."}, {"Title": "A DSM-5 to-do list for adult psychiatry residency directors.", "Abstract": "A small study within the author's department, comparing resident and faculty attitudes toward the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), revealed that the DSM-5 transition process is starting from a point in which neither faculty nor residents are optimistic that the new DSM will result in improved diagnosis or treatment.

The objective of this study is to examine the feasibility and treatment efficacy of a Korean version of PEERS(\u00ae) for enhancing social skills through a randomized controlled trial (RCT).The English version of the PEERS(\u00ae) Treatment Manual (Laugeson & Frankel, 2010) was translated into Korean and reviewed by 21 child mental health professionals. Items identified as culturally sensitive were surveyed by 447 middle school students, and material was modified accordingly. Participants included 47 teens between 12 and 18 years of age with a diagnosis of ASD and a verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) \u2265 65. Eligible teens were randomly assigned to a treatment group (TG) or delayed treatment control group (CG). Primary outcome measures included questionnaires and direct observations quantifying social ability and problems directly related to ASD. Secondary outcome measures included scales for depressive symptoms, anxiety, and other behavioral problems. Rating scales for parental depressive symptoms and anxiety were examined to detect changes in parental psychosocial functioning throughout the PEERS(\u00ae) treatment. Independent samples t-tests revealed no significant differences at baseline across the TG and CG conditions with regard to age (14.04 \u00b1 1.64 and 13.54 \u00b1 1.50 years), IQ (99.39 \u00b1 18.09 & 100.67 \u00b1 16.97), parental education, socioeconomic status, or ASD symptoms (p < 0.05), respectively. Results for treatment outcome suggest that the TG showed significant improvement in communication and social interaction domain scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, interpersonal relationship and play/leisure time on the subdomain scores of the Korean version of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (p's < 0.01), social skills knowledge total scores on the Test of Adolescent Social Skills Knowledge-Revised (p < 0.01), and decreased depressive symptoms on the Child Depression Inventory following treatment (p < 0.05). Analyses of parental outcome reveal a significant decrease in maternal state anxiety in the TG after controlling for potential confounding variables (p < 0.05). Despite cultural and linguistic differences, the PEERS(\u00ae) social skills intervention appears to be efficacious for teens with ASD in Korea with modest cultural adjustment. In an RCT, participants receiving the PEERS(\u00ae) treatment showed significant improvement in social skills knowledge, interpersonal skills, and play/leisure skills, as well as a decrease in depressive symptoms and ASD symptoms. This study represents one of only a few cross-cultural validation trials of an established evidence-based treatment for adolescents with ASD."}, {"Title": "Predictors of readmission to a psychiatry inpatient unit.", "Abstract": "To determine predictors of time to readmission to a general psychiatry inpatient unit.\nData from the Minimum Data Set-Mental Health (MDS-MH), a standardized assessment used to collect demographic and clinical information, were retrospectively reviewed from April 2006 through October 2008. A total of 758 patients were eligible for the study. A set of clinically relevant predictors was generated based on a literature review. A Cox regression model was applied to determine which variables were most predictive of shorter time to readmission, and their respective hazard ratios (HR).\nCovariates that were significantly associated with readmission (HR [95% CI]) included receiving a pass (3.48 [2.33, 5.17], p \u2264 0.0005), 1-2 psychiatric admissions in the past two years (15.63 [7.50, 32.55], p \u2264 0.0005), and more than 3 psychiatric admissions in the past two years (24.15 [11.58, 50.36], p \u2264 0.0005). Post hoc analysis indicated that those issued passes were more commonly male (57.1% vs. 43.9%, p=0.03), with a longer length of stay (25.4 \u00b1 21.2 days vs. 18.7 \u00b1 21.1 days, p=0.008), and higher GAF score (62.8 \u00b1 11.1 vs. 57.8 \u00b1 13.9, p=0.003), but were otherwise similar.\nThe factors that were associated with reduced time to readmission were a history of previous admissions and receipt of a pass prior to discharge. These results suggest that while physicians may be able to identify patients at high risk of early readmission, issuing a pass may not fully mitigate this risk. There is a need for critical research evaluating the potential benefits of passes."}, {"Title": "Development, implementation, and evaluation of a movie-based curriculum to teach psychopathology.", "Abstract": "Because medical students' attitudes toward psychiatry are often fostered by media, we provided an elective movie-based seminar to teach psychopathology.\nWe assessed attitudes toward psychiatry by using the Attitudes towards Psychiatry (ATP 35) scale in a pre-post design.

Teaching encounters were timed and faculty, learners, and patients completed post encounter surveys.\nParticipation included 126 patients, nine faculty, and 16 residents. Comparison of patient encounters randomized to exam room (n = 58) or conference room (n = 64) demonstrated that exam room teaching was roughly twice as time efficient as conference room teaching (p \u2264 .0001). Patients expressed a preference for exam room teaching during future visits (p \u2264 .003) for those patients who experienced exam room teaching during the study. Faculty were generally comfortable with exam room teaching and felt it had some advantages for patient decision making. Learners felt they had to choose their words more carefully in exam room teaching and expressed some concerns about depth of teaching.\nOnce exposed to exam room teaching, this model is acceptable and feasible to faculty, learners, and patients in a psychiatry clinic setting."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric nursing care for adult survivors of child maltreatment: a systematic review of the literature.", "Abstract": "To determine what is known from the literature about nursing care of psychiatric patients with a history of child maltreatment.\nPsychiatric nurses underline the importance of a routine inquiry of child abuse on admission of patients to psychiatric care, but are reluctant to ask about child abuse.

Although recently transdiagnostic treatments have been developed, no known treatments have addressed this comorbidity pattern specifically. Preliminary support exists for acceptance-based approaches for depression and SAD separately, and they may be more efficacious for comorbid depression and anxiety compared with traditional cognitive-behavioral approaches. The aim of the current study was to develop and pilot test an integrated acceptance-based behavioral treatment for depression and comorbid SAD. Participants included 38 patients seeking pharmacotherapy at an outpatient psychiatry practice, who received 16 individual sessions of the therapy. Results showed significant improvement in symptoms, functioning, and processes from pre- to post-treatment, as well as high satisfaction with the treatment. These results support the preliminary acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of this treatment in a typical outpatient psychiatry practice, and suggest that further research on this treatment in larger randomized trials is warranted."}, {"Title": "[Reimbursement in psychiatry and psychosomatics: proof of concept for a system based on daily costs].", "Abstract": "In Germany a new reimbursement system for psychiatry and psychosomatics is under development. Based on total costs of each case from selected hospitals and day clinics, in 2013 the Institute for the Hospital Remuneration System (InEK) proposed to reimburse the hospital costs daily with step-wise decreasing remuneration, mainly depending on the ICD-10 diagnosis, duration of stay and some complicating factors (PEPP grouper). It is controversial whether this degressive system will result in an inadequate remuneration of patients with longer duration of severe symptoms, such as suicidality in depression or autoaggressive behavior in borderline personality disorder and will eventually lead to advantages for acutely ill patients with short duration of stay compared to chronically ill patients.\nThis study formulated and tested an alternative remuneration system (proof of concept) mainly based on an analysis of daily cost data instead of the total costs of each case.\nThe study is based on 147,749 treatment days from 4,633 cases of patients with psychotic disorders (PEPP-PA03) in 6 hospitals. As possible cost separating factors the study analyzed days with and without intensive psychiatric care, 1 to 1 care, psychological diagnostics, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), acute crisis intervention, age at admission, the first days of treatment and day of discharge.\nNearly all factors tested were shown to be statistically significant in separating daily hospital costs. Based on these findings an alternative calculation algorithm (TEPPconcret), which grouped the cases with respect to age, intensive care, 1 to 1 care, treatment days 1-4 and day of discharge, was formulated and tested. For psychotic disorders TEPPconcret with a basic rate complemented by daily add-on payments depending on the effort involved, is a serious alternative to the PEPP system and awaits further evaluation."}, {"Title": "[Sleep, learning and memory: relevance for psychiatry and psychotherapy].", "Abstract": "Sleep has been identified as a state that optimizes the consolidation of newly acquired information in the memory.

Files were randomly selected, and demographic (age, diagnosis) and risk factor (WC, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, blood pressure) data were extracted. WC was higher in this cohort compared to published general population means, and only 19% of patients had a BMI within the healthy range. In total, 37% of patients smoked, while 31% were hypertensive. At baseline, none of the audited files reported WC, which increased to 35 of the 60 (58%) files audited at the 3-month follow up. At the 9-month follow up, 25 of the 60 (42%) files audited reported a WC. In the 120 post-intervention files audited, only two patients refused measurement.

Psychiatry lacks a definition of mental disorder that covers all situations, there are difficulties in drawing a precise distinction between normality and psychopathology, and the majority of these \"diagnostic\" categories are not validated by biological criteria. Furthermore, there is still a debate on the nature of the symptoms of mental disorders, a confusion classification and diagnosis and a preoccupation with the growing inflation of diagnostic categories. Localizationism, that is, the approach to brain function considering that particular pychological functions are carried out by particular brain areas or centers, helps to understand many clinical and psychological phenomena, but have largely failed to explaining the nature of most mental disorders. The crisis should be confronted by putting emphasis on psychopathology instead than in classification, in functions rather than in diagnostic criteria, to be aware in the progress in neuroscientific monistic perspectives and by importing the methods of the emerging connectomics."}, {"Title": "Forty years of a psychiatric day hospital.", "Abstract": "Day hospitals in psychiatry are a major alternative to inpatient care today, acting as key components of community and social psychiatry.\nTo study trends in the use of psychiatric day hospitals over the last decades of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, focusing on patient age, sex, and diagnostic group, using data from Centro Hospitalar S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Porto, Portugal.\nData corresponding to years 1970 to 2009 were collected from patient files.

The first onset of mental illness usually occurs during childhood or adolescence. Neuroimaging and genetic testing have been invaluable in research on behavioral and intentional disorders, particularly with their potential to lead to improved diagnostic and predictive capabilities and to decrease the associated burdens of disease. The present study focused specifically the perspectives of mental health providers on the role of neuroimaging and genetic testing in clinical practice with children and adolescents. We interviewed 38 psychiatrists, psychologists, and allied mental health professionals who work primarily with youth about their receptivity towards either the use of neuroimaging or genetic testing. Interviews probed the role they foresee for these modalities for prediction, diagnosis, and treatment planning, and the benefits and risks they anticipate. Practitioners anticipated three major benefits associated with clinical introduction of imaging and genetic testing in the mental health care for youth: (1) improved understanding of illness, (2) more accurate diagnosis than available through conventional clinical examination, and (3) validation of treatment plans. They also perceived three major risks: (1) potential adverse impacts on employment and insurance as adolescents reach adulthood, (2) misuse or misinterpretation of the imaging or genetic data, and (3) infringements on self-esteem or self-motivation.

Despite the fact that most patients participating in the study had intellectual preoccupations and, to some extent, enjoyed working, 82% of them did not have a job. The percentage of those who did was higher in the cohort of patients on depot medication (63%) than in the cohort of patients for whom orally administered medication was prescribed (53%).\nTreatment adherence in patients with schizophrenia is thus significantly improved by depot medication, whereas treatment effectiveness and the frequency of adverse effects are similar for the two treatment options."}, {"Title": "Catatonia in the History of Psychiatry: Construction and Deconstruction of a Disease Concept.", "Abstract": "Catatonia is a psychomotor disorder that has gone through numerous descriptions since 1874, reflecting the many changes in psychiatric disease conceptualization that have occurred within that time frame. Catatonia has been variously described as a distinct disease entity, as a part of schizophrenia, and as a nonspecific manifestation of many disorders. Because of its association with schizophrenia, the description of catatonia was particularly affected by the psychopharmacological era, beginning in the 1950s, and by the development of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Changing trends in psychiatric research--especially the brain-based disease model, research methods favoured by the evidence-based medicine movement, and the codes and categories of the DSM--also profoundly influenced the evolving concept of catatonia. This paper discusses these important factors that affected recognition, treatment, and study of catatonia in order to reveal the biases and assumptions made when constructing a disease concept."}, {"Title": "Psychotherapy for suicidal patients with borderline personality disorder: an expert consensus review of common factors across five therapies.", "Abstract": "The objective was to review established literature on approaches to the psychotherapy of borderline personality disorder with specfic reference to suicide in order to determine if there were common factors across these efforts that would guide future teaching, practice and research. The publications from the proponents of five therapies for the treatment of suicidal behavior in individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD), were reviewed and discussed by the members of the Group for the Advanced of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy Committee (GAPPC). Twenty nine published research and summary reports were reviewed of the specific treatments noted above along with two other reviews of common factors for this group of treatments. We used expert consensus as to the salient articles for review and the appropriate level of abstraction for the common factor definition. We formulated a definition of effectiveness and identified six common factors: 1) negotiation of a specific frame for treatment, 2) recognition and insistence on the patient's responsibilities within the therapy, 3) provision to the therapist of a conceptual framework for understanding and intervening, 4) use of the therapeutic relationship to engage and address suicide, 5) prioritization of suicide as a topic to be actively addressed whenever it emerges, and 6) provision of support for the therapist in the form of supervision, consultation or peer support. We discuss common factors, their formulation, and implications for development and teaching of psychotherapeutic approaches specific to suicide in patients with borderline personality disorder and note that there should be greater attention in practice and education to these issues."}, {"Title": "Biologism in Psychiatry: A Young Man's Experience of Being Diagnosed with \"Pediatric Bipolar Disorder\".", "Abstract": "Pediatric bipolar disorder is a diagnosis that arose in the mid 1990s in the USA and has mostly remained confined to that nation. In this article a young American man (under a pseudonym) describes his experience of having the diagnosis throughout his adolescent years. His story was conveyed via correspondence and a meeting with the author, an Australian child psychiatrist. The young American's story reveals several issues that afflict contemporary psychiatry, particularly in the USA, where social and economic factors have contributed to the rise of a dominant biomedical paradigm-or \"biologism\". This focus on the \"bio\" to the relative exclusion of the \"psychosocial\" in both diagnosis and treatment can have serious consequences as this young man's story attests. The author explores aspects of his tale to analyze how the pediatric bipolar disorder \"epidemic\" arose and became emblematic of a dominant biologism. This narrative points to the need, depending on the service and country, to return to or retain/improve a balanced biopsychosocial perspective in child and adolescent mental health. Child psychiatry needs to advocate for health systems that support deeper listening to our patients. Then we can explore with them the full range of contextual factors that contribute to symptoms of individual and family distress."}, {"Title": "[The fake lady on trial: transvestitism in psychiatry and the sexual sciences, or the regulation of public dress-code].", "Abstract": "With the publication of Carl Westphal's \"die contr\u00e4re Sexualempfindung\" or \"the Contrary Sexual Feeling\" (1870), non-conform sexual/gender behavior, such as wearing clothing from the opposite gender, fell within psychiatry's field of activity; psychiatrists cooperated with law enforcement to maintain the public ordering of the sexes. On the basis of the Charit\u00e9's medical records of a male patient, reported to have publically appeared in women's clothing and thereby making headlines in 1910 as the 'fake lady', the positions of psychiatrist Theodor Ziehen and sexual scientist Magnus Hirschfeld stand in contrast to one another--a development, which affected their forensic argumentation. As Hirschfeld had, in the same year 1910, introduced the concept of transvestitism to describe this very phenomenon, a transfer of competing interpretations out of sexual science and into psychiatry can be studied. The circulation of Magnus Hirschfeld's questionnaire to the vita sexualis allows for an investigation of the effects of such on the collective, biographical narration of sexual minorities, as well as on diagnostic capacity in psychiatry, in reference to transvestitism. An analysis of press-reports on the case and trials of the 'fake lady' approaches the question, how non-conform sexual behavior was to be recognized or identified in public and, for the sake of prevention, how it was explained. Such an analysis also investigates the role of the press in the popularization of Hirschfield's transvestitism concept."}, {"Title": "The South African Depression and Anxiety Group and government hospital partners: Addressing the challenge of poor adherence in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The Helen Joseph Hospital, a government regional hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa, became aware of patient non-adherence issues at their specialist psychiatric outpatient department. In partnership with the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (SADAG), Africa's largest support network and advocacy group for people affected by mental health problems, and sponsored by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, they aimed to address the issue of non-adherence by developing and implementing a Reminder and Support Adherence Programme (RSAP). By providing a comprehensive service that regularly reminds patients to take their medication, attend their clinic appointments, offers free health information and psychosocial support, this has allowed many patients to benefit from the programme's ability to address the range of problems related to non-adherence."}, {"Title": "[Contemporary place of the electroconvulsive therapy Part 1.

Drawing on newly accessible source material, this study addresses this gap in the literature, delineating issues of key concern to the topic. The paper first explores specific interrelationships between legal and nosological points of view in the theories of forensic psychiatry that prevailed in the USSR. On this basis, it then reconstructs the functional characteristics of the \"diagnosis factory\" run under the auspices of Andrej V. Sneshnewski, illuminating the role of this school of psychiatry in the context of the history of medicine. In the third section of the paper, the discussion turns to institutional conditions, political factors, ideological implications, and socio-cultural contexts related to how hegemonic actors in Soviet forensic psychiatry dealt with non-conformers. In this context, a focus is placed on instances of resistance and dissidence within Soviet psychiatry. In particular, the paper discusses how polemics that relied on values and norms were of central importance to the political misuse of psychiatry as a nucleus and catalyst of democratic self-reflection during the reform era that took place under Mikhail Gorbachev."}, {"Title": "The images of psychiatry scale: development, factor structure, and reliability.", "Abstract": "This analysis is based on a survey questionnaire designed to describe medical educators' views of psychiatry and psychiatrists. Our goals in this paper were to assess the psychometric properties of the survey questions by (a) using exploratory factor analysis to identify the basic factor structure underlying 37 survey items; (b) testing the resulting factor structure using confirmatory factor analysis; and (c) assessing the internal reliability of each identified factor. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use these techniques to psychometrically assess a scale measuring the strength of stigma that medical educators attached to psychiatry.\nSurvey data were collected from a random sample of 1,059 teaching faculty in 23 academic teaching sites in 15 countries. We conducted exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to identify the scale structure and Cronbach's alpha to assess internal consistency of the resulting scales.\nResults showed that a two-factor solution was the best fit for the data. Following exploratory factor analysis, we conducted confirmatory factor analysis on a split half of the sample. Results highlighted several items with low loadings. Excluding factors with low correlations and allowing for several correlated variances resulted in a good fitting model explaining 95% of the variance in the data.\nWe identified two unidimensional scales. The Images Scale contained 11 items measuring stereotypic content concerning psychiatry and psychiatrists. The Efficacy of Psychiatry Scale contained 5 items addressing perceptions of the challenges and effectiveness of psychiatry as a discipline."}, {"Title": "Analysis of variability of concentrations of valproic acid (VPA) and its selected metabolites in the blood serum of patients treated with VPA and patients hospitalized because of VPA poisoning.", "Abstract": "To compare the metabolic profile of valproic acid (VPA) in the studied groups of cases through an analysis of variability of concentrations of VPA with its selected metabolites (2-ene-VPA, 4-ene-VPA, 3-keto-VPA).\nBlood serum samples collected from 27 patients treated with VPA drugs in the Psychiatry Unit and in the Neurology and Cerebral Strokes Unit at the Ludwik Rydygier Provincial Specialist Hospital in Krakow, and blood serum samples collected from 26 patients hospitalized because of suspected acute VPA poisoning at the Toxicology Department, Chair of Toxicology and Environmental Diseases, Jagiellonian University Medical College in Krakow.\nThe analysis of concentrations of VPA and its selected metabolites has shown that the metabolic profile of VPA determined in cases of acute poisoning is different from cases of VPA therapy. One of VPA's metabolic pathways - the process of desaturation - is unchanged in acute poisoning and prevails over the process of \u03b2-oxidation. The ingestion of toxic VPA doses results in an increased formation of 4-ene-VPA, proportional to an increase in VPA concentration. Acute VPA poisoning involves the saturation of VPA's metabolic transformations at the stage of \u03b2-oxidation. The process of oxidation of 2-ene-VPA to 3-keto-VPA is slowed down after the ingestion of toxic doses."}, {"Title": "[Eric D.

In order to enhance the function of such healthcare, it is necessary both to provide specialized training in each occupation and form a system and to smoothly conduct medical collaboration between different occupations. A deficiency in the medical function of perinatal mental healthcare greatly influences the mother and child's health, mental hygiene, and social life later in life. Therefore, a demand is seen for specialized staff and system formation capable of the following: 1) responding with appropriate perinatal management of female patients taking psychotropic drugs; 2) providing support and pregnancy consultation to female patients who wish to have children; and 3) properly handling postpartum mental disorder management, possibility of breastfeeding, and various issues that arise in mother-child relationships during upbringing. In the UK, the clinical guideline (NICE Clinical Guideline 45) for perinatal mental healthcare, which was created by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), provides important guidelines on how to handle perinatal mental health. Aside from the NICE guideline, the Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines in Psychiatry indicates basic guidelines on prescribing perinatal drug therapy. In Japan, however, the current situation of perinatal mental healthcare is such that it has yet to be systemically developed. In this paper, we introduce the basic content in these British guidelines that should be noted. In addition, we consider the current status and future disposition of Japan's perinatal mental healthcare, with consideration for the differences in healthcare circumstances between Japan and the UK."}, {"Title": "The place of psychotherapy in contemporary psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychotherapy has long been an essential component of clinical psychiatry and many young physicians choose to train in psychiatry residency programs in order to acquire necessary knowledge and skills, and become competent psychotherapists. Recent advances in psychopharmacology and neuroscience, and growing dominance of managed care and evidence-based medicine have had dramatic impacts on health care delivery systems and clinical psychiatry practice. Despite these changes in the field of mental health, psychotherapy still remains a crucial part of clinical psychiatry and comprises a great proportion of psychiatrists' clinical practice. Hence, accreditation agencies and regulatory bodies determine compulsory minimum requirements for psychiatry residency programs to ensure that residents, at the end of their specialty training, can demonstrate competence in managing their patients through applying different approaches of psychotherapy."}, {"Title": "The rise of large-scale imaging studies in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "From the initial arguments over whether 12 to 20 subjects were sufficient for an fMRI study, sample sizes in psychiatric neuroimaging studies have expanded into the tens of thousands. These large-scale imaging studies fall into several categories, each of which has specific advantages and challenges. The different study types can be grouped based on their level of control: meta-analyses, at one extreme of the spectrum, control nothing about the imaging protocol or subject selection criteria in the datasets they include, On the other hand, planned multi-site mega studies pour intense efforts into strictly having the same protocols. However, there are several other combinations possible, each of which is best used to address certain questions. The growing investment of all these studies is delivering on the promises of neuroimaging for psychiatry, and holds incredible potential for impact at the level of the individual patient. However, to realize this potential requires both standardized data-sharing efforts, so that there is more staying power in the datasets for re-use and new applications, as well as training the next generation of neuropsychiatric researchers in \"Big Data\" techniques in addition to traditional experimental methods.

Instead of aiming at re-entry into society, treatment in long-term forensic psychiatric care (LFPC) is principally aimed at medical and psychiatric care and optimising quality of life (QoL). To assess QoL in LFPC, the influence of both the mental disorder and the restrictive context should be considered. Therefore, a new instrument was developed: the Forensic inpatient QoL questionnaire (FQL). The FQL is based on the results of concept-mapping with patients and staff within LFPC. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the FQL. One hundred and sixty-three FQLs, filled out by 98 male long-term forensic psychiatric patients, were included for testing reliability and content validity. For testing construct validity, 53 patients additionally completed the World Health Organisation Quality of Life-Brief version and 50 of them the Affect Balance Scale. Outcomes indicate that the FQL has good psychometric properties. Fifteen of the 16 FQL domains showed adequate to good reliability (Cronbach's <i>\u03b1</i> range .69-.91) and 9 domains met the criteria for homogeneity. Content validity was demonstrated by exploratory factor analysis, which revealed a three-factor structure: social well-being, physical well-being and leave. Construct validity was supported by 59% correctly hypothesised inter- and intrascale Pearson's correlation coefficients. Good psychometric properties and its clinical-based development make the FQL a valid and useful instrument for QoL assessment in LFPC. The FQL could therefore contribute to evidence-based and more advanced treatment programmes in LFPC."}, {"Title": "[Stress-induced dissociation in the trajectory of schizotypal personality disorder (on the model of nosogenias in oncologic patients)].", "Abstract": "Stress-induced dissociative disorders (DD) have high prevalence in psychiatry and general medicine but the psychopathological differentiation of DD and contribution of personality disorders in their development is less studied. Authors conducted a clinical analysis of stress-induced persistent DD and underlying constitutional abnormalities.\nIt was examined 20 patients with DD induced by the stress caused by a cancer diagnosis, including 10 patients of detachment-dissociation group (denial of the disease, non-compliance) and 10 patients with compartment-dissociation (complete or partial detachment of stress response components (emotional, cognitive), adequate compliancy). The groups were matched for demographic and cancer characteristics. Clinical and psychological methods were used.\nDD are secondary psychopathological phenomena. Detachment-dissociation develops in the frames of schizophrenic nosogenic reactions based on overvalued ideas of somatic well-being (or complete recovery from cancer) and has some similarities to schizotypal personality disorder. Compartment-dissociation develops within the limits of neurotic nosogenic reactions on the basis of binary psychogenic complexes - pathology of the imagination (\"the beautiful indifference\") concomitant to anxiety about the real illness and is similar to hysterical personality spectrum."}, {"Title": "[Controversial problems of clinical psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Current existing problems of clinical psychiatry are considered in the aspect of most urgent and unresolved issues in the field of schizophrenia.

However, at the time, commercially available human ELISA kits were unable to distinguish between pro-BDNF (precursor BDNF) and mature BDNF, because of limited antibody specificity. Here, we used new ELISA kits, to examine serum levels of mature BDNF and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which converts pro-BDNF to mature BDNF in schizophrenia. Sixty-three patients with chronic schizophrenia and 52 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Patients were evaluated using the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale, the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and neuropsychological tests. Neither serum mature BDNF nor MMP-9 levels differed between patients and controls. In male subgroups, serum MMP-9 levels of smoking patients were higher than those of non-smoking patients, but this was not observed in male controls or the female subgroup. In patients, serum mature BDNF levels were associated with SANS total scores and the Information subtest scores of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised (WAIS-R), while serum MMP-9 levels were associated with smoking and category fluency scores. These findings suggest that neither mature BDNF nor MMP-9 is a suitable biomarker for schizophrenia, although further studies using large samples are needed."}, {"Title": "Comparison of symptoms of delirium across various motoric subtypes.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between delirium motor subtypes and other symptoms of delirium.\nThree hundred and twenty-one (n\u2009=\u2009321) consecutive patients referred to consultation-liaison psychiatry services were evaluated on Delirium Rating scale-Revised-98 version and amended Delirium Motor Symptom Scale.\nHalf of the patients had hyperactive subtype (n\u2009=\u2009161; 50.15%) delirium.

This paper places the figure of sociologist Lee Nelken Robins within the context of the Department of Psychiatry in the School of Medicine at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. The St Louis research group--to which Robins was both marginal and central--developed the basis for specific diagnostic criteria and was joined by Robert Spitzer, Jean Endicott and other architects of DSM-III in reorienting American psychiatry towards medical, biological and epidemiological models. Robins was a key linchpin working at the nexus of the psychiatric epidemiological and sociological drug addiction research networks.

This study's goal is to review strengths and limitations of literature comparing psychiatric categories with cultural concepts of distress (CCD) such as cultural syndromes, culture-bound syndromes, and idioms of distress.\nThe Systematic Assessment of Quality in Observational Research (SAQOR) was adapted based on cultural psychiatry principles to develop a Cultural Psychiatry Epidemiology version (SAQOR-CPE), which was used to rate quality of quantitative studies comparing CCD and psychiatric categories. A meta-analysis was performed for each psychiatric category.\nForty-five studies met inclusion criteria, with 18 782 unique participants. Primary objectives of the studies included comparing CCD and psychiatric disorders (51%), assessing risk factors for CCD (18%) and instrument validation (16%). Only 27% of studies met SAQOR-CPE criteria for medium quality, with the remainder low or very low quality. Only 29% of studies employed representative samples, 53% used validated outcome measures, 44% included function assessments and 44% controlled for confounding. Meta-analyses for anxiety, depression, PTSD and somatization revealed high heterogeneity (I(2) > 75%). Only general psychological distress had low heterogeneity (I(2) = 8%) with a summary effect odds ratio of 5.39 (95% CI 4.71-6.17). Associations between CCD and psychiatric disorders were influenced by methodological issues, such as validation designs (\u03b2 = 16.27, 95%CI 12.75-19.79) and use of CCD multi-item checklists (\u03b2 = 6.10, 95%CI 1.89-10.31). Higher quality studies demonstrated weaker associations of CCD and psychiatric disorders.\nCultural concepts of distress are not inherently unamenable to epidemiological study. However, poor study quality impedes conceptual advancement and service application. With improved study design and reporting using guidelines such as the SAQOR-CPE, CCD research can enhance detection of mental health problems, reduce cultural biases in diagnostic criteria and increase cultural salience of intervention trial outcomes."}, {"Title": "The comparison of brand-name and generic formulations of venlafaxine: a therapeutic drug monitoring analysis.", "Abstract": "Venlafaxine (VEN) is a widely used antidepressant drug, which is available in both brand-name and generic formulations.

No difference in dose-corrected serum concentrations between generic and brand-name VEN was revealed for males, females, smokers, or nonsmokers. In both groups, Spearman Rho correlation between VEN dose and VEN + ODV serum concentration was moderate but significant (P < 0.001; generic: r = 0.554; brand name: r = 0.668). Within the generic subgroup, females had a significantly higher dose-corrected serum concentration of VEN (U test, P < 0.05), whereas within brand name, no gender influence was detected. Spearman Rho correlation of age and dose-corrected ODV (P < 0.05) and VEN + ODV (P < 0.05) was significant only in the generic group.

In recent years, a third generation of antipsychotics was identified. Aripiprazole was the first approved drug acting as a D2 partial agonist/functionally selective ligand. This review presents the state of the development of novel antipsychotic dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic agents, supported by an overview of the compounds evaluated under advanced preclinical and clinical development (e.g., cariprazine and brexpiprazole). In line with the recent trends in the development of modern atypical antipsychotics, we present our strategic development of long-chain arylpiperazine-derived quinoline- and isoquinoline-sulfonamide displaying a multireceptor binding profile and partial D2 receptor agonism."}, {"Title": "[Sleep medicine differential diagnostics in psychiatry and psychotherapy].", "Abstract": "Complaints about disturbed sleep or increased daytime sleepiness are among the most frequent symptoms reported to psychiatrists by patients. Such complaints can be symptoms of an underlying psychiatric disorder or indicative of a separate or comorbid sleep disorder. Hence, basic knowledge in the differential diagnosis of sleep medicine pathologies is pivotal for psychiatrists and psychotherapists. In the present overview following a description of the diagnostic methods, the diagnostic work-up according to the major symptomatic clusters, namely disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep, abnormal nocturnal movements and excessive daytime sleepiness will be presented."}, {"Title": "Pharmacogenomics in psychiatry: the relevance of receptor and transporter polymorphisms.", "Abstract": "The treatment of severe mental illness, and of psychiatric disorders in general, is limited in its efficacy and tolerability. There appear to be substantial interindividual differences in response to psychiatric drug treatments that are generally far greater than the differences between individual drugs; likewise, the occurrence of adverse effects also varies profoundly between individuals. These differences are thought to reflect, at least in part, genetic variability. The action of psychiatric drugs primarily involves effects on synaptic neurotransmission; the genes for neurotransmitter receptors and transporters have provided strong candidates in pharmacogenetic research in psychiatry. This paper reviews some aspects of the pharmacogenetics of neurotransmitter receptors and transporters in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. A focus on serotonin, catecholamines and amino acid transmitter systems reflects the direction of research efforts, while relevant results from some genome-wide association studies are also presented. There are many inconsistencies, particularly between candidate gene and genome-wide association studies. However, some consistency is seen in candidate gene studies supporting established pharmacological mechanisms of antipsychotic and antidepressant response with associations of functional genetic polymorphisms in, respectively, the dopamine D2 receptor and serotonin transporter and receptors. More recently identified effects of genes related to amino acid neurotransmission on the outcome of treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar illness or depression reflect the growing understanding of the roles of glutamate and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid dysfunction in severe mental illness. A complete understanding of psychiatric pharmacogenomics will also need to take into account epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation, that influence individual responses to drugs."}, {"Title": "Correlates of depression in bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "We analyse time series from 100 patients with bipolar disorder for correlates of depression symptoms. As the sampling interval is non-uniform, we quantify the extent of missing and irregular data using new measures of compliance and continuity. We find that uniformity of response is negatively correlated with the standard deviation of sleep ratings (\u03c1 = -0.26, p = 0.01). To investigate the correlation structure of the time series themselves, we apply the Edelson-Krolik method for correlation estimation. We examine the correlation between depression symptoms for a subset of patients and find that self-reported measures of sleep and appetite/weight show a lower average correlation than other symptoms. Using surrogate time series as a reference dataset, we find no evidence that depression is correlated between patients, though we note a possible loss of information from sparse sampling."}, {"Title": "A war over mental health professionalism: Scientology versus psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Over 60 years ago, founder L.

Apart from gathering statistics concerning case history, diagnosis, offence committed and resulting confinement, a dynamic analysis of how they coped in differing day to day situations was carried out with 115 of the discharged patients.\nThe frequency of offence recidivism by patients who were professionally accompanied throughout the aftercare period was significantly lower in comparison to earlier studies (without specialist supervision), particularly the number of sexual offences and violent crimes (7 from 225 - 3.1\u2009%) were noticeably reduced. By comparing patients who reoffended with those showing socially acceptable behavior it was possible to determine specific features of protection and risk characteristics.\nLow offence recidivism indicated a high degree of aftercare effectiveness but there is room for improvement and further development in the existing system. The postdischarge prognosis factors and the typical pitfalls found in the study should be adequately taken into account in order to improve risk management in the aftercare setting and therefore subsequently ameliorate the chances of discharge for long neglected problematic patient groups, in particular patients with personality disorders involved in sexual offences."}, {"Title": "[Therapeutic drug monitoring in psychiatry.

However, psychology and psychiatry have long sought to uncover mechanistic explanations for human behavior that challenge the notion of free will. In recent years, neuroscientific discoveries have produced a model of volitional behavior that is at odds with the notion of contra-causal free will and our sense of conscious agency. Volitional behavior instead appears to have antecedents in unconscious brain activity that is localizable to specific neuroanatomical structures. Updating notions of free will in favor of a continuous model of volitional self-control provides a useful paradigm to conceptualize and study some forms of psychopathology such as addiction and impulse control disorders. Similarly, thinking of specific symptoms of schizophrenia as disorders of agency may help to elucidate mechanisms of psychosis. Beyond clinical understanding and etiological research, a neuroscientific model of volitional behavior has the potential to modernize forensic notions of responsibility and criminal punishment in order to inform public policy. Ultimately, moving away from the language of free will towards the language of volitional control may result in an enhanced understanding of the very nature of ourselves."}, {"Title": "Editorial: bridging gaps between basic research and clinical practice.", "Abstract": "Over the past several decades, child psychology and psychiatry has witnessed an explosion in the volume of, and a decided quickening in the pace of, dissemination of research findings.

The DSM-5 has attracted considerable criticism, not least about its role in processes of medicalisation. This paper suggests the need for a sociology of psychiatric critique. Sociological analysis can help map fields of contention, and cast fresh light on the assumptions and nuances of debate around the DSM-5; it underscores the importance of diagnosis to the governance of social and clinical life, as well as the wider discourses critical commentaries connect with and are activated by. More normatively, a sociology of critique can indicate which interests and values are structuring the dialogues being articulated, and just how diverse clinical opinion regarding the DSM can actually be.

Consequence-based ethical concerns about this expansion are addressed, along with conceptual concerns about a confusion of \"construct validity\" and \"conceptual validity\" and a failure to distinguish between \"disorder\" and \"non disordered conditions for which we help people.\"(2) The role of claims about societal impact in changes in nosology: Several changes in the DSM-5 involved claims about societal impact in their rationales. This is due in part to a new online open comment period during DSM development. Examples include advancement of science, greater access to treatment, greater public awareness of condition, loss of identify or harm to those with removed disorders, stigmatization, offensiveness, etc. I identify and evaluate four importantly distinct ways in which claims about societal impact might operate in DSM development.

Although this tradition offers promising interface with current neurobiological models of schizophrenia, both the concept of Ichst\u00f6rung and its history are not well understood. In this article, we discuss the meaning of Ichst\u00f6rung, the role it played in the development of the concept of schizophrenia, and recent research on metacognition that allows for the quantitative study of the link between self-disturbance and outcome in schizophrenia. Phenomenological psychiatrists such as Blankenburg, Binswanger, and Conrad interpreted the Ichst\u00f6rung as disturbed relationship to self and others, thus challenging recent efforts to interpret self-disturbance as diminished pure passive self-affection, which putatively \"explains\" schizophrenia and its various symptoms. Narrative is a reflective, embodied process, which requires a dynamic shifting of perspectives which, when compromised, may reflect disrupted binding of the components of self-experience.

By the 1950s psychological perspectives began to dominate in forensic psychiatry. In the forensic records of the 1950s we can notice a shift from a biomedical to a socio-psychological perspective, and crime was increasingly related to conditions that were not seen as mental derangement from a legal point of view.

There is currently no standard treatment approach for physicians confronted with such patients. This may be the result of notions that TD is disappearing because of the switch to second-generation antipsychotic agents and that it is largely reversible. In this article we demonstrate that second-generation antipsychotics do, indeed, cause TD and, in fact, the frequency is likely higher than expected because of growing off-label uses and a tripling of prescriptions written in the last 10 years. In addition, studies demonstrate that TD actually remits in only a minority of patients when these drugs are withdrawn. Furthermore, neuroleptic agents are often utilized to treat TD, despite prolonged exposure being a risk factor for irreversibility. The outcome of these trends is a growing population afflicted with TD. We review non-neuroleptic agents that have shown positive results in small, early-phase, blinded trials, including tetrabenazine, amantadine, levetiracetam, piracetam, clonazepam, propranolol, vitamin B6, and Ginkgo biloba.

The median prevalence of depression, as perceived by respondents, in the present respondent patient populations was 20% (range 0%-90%); 57.1% of respondents always assessed for depression, whereas 42.9% assessed for depression sometimes. The majority (98.9%) of respondents relied on clinical interviews to assess depression; non-somatic symptoms of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria were more useful than somatic symptoms. The depression screening tools most frequently used were one- and two-item questions. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods were used to treat depression, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors the most frequently prescribed medications. Psycho-educational and supportive counselling were the most frequently used non-pharmacological interventions. Nominated measures to augment depression management included improving access to psychiatry, psychology and other allied health services, the development of a screening tool specific to palliative care patients and associated guidelines for depression management.\nThis is the first Australasian study to explore the practice of medical practitioners regarding depression in palliative patients. Incorporation of screening tool questions into palliative care assessment interviews may warrant future research. WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE TOPIC? Depression in palliative care patients has a negative impact on quality of life; however, little is known about how Australasian palliative care medical practitioners manage depression in this patient population. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD? To the researchers' knowledge, this is the first Australasian study that explores the practices of local palliative care specialists in the management of depression in palliative patients. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS? Overall management of depression in palliative care populations by Australasian practitioners is similar to that of their European colleagues. Consensus is that for assessment of depression in palliative patients, non-somatic symptoms of DSM-IV criteria are more useful than somatic symptoms. Practitioners report the need for improved access to psychiatric, psychological and other support services, for a palliative care-specific depression screening tool and for depression management guidelines applicable to palliative care patients."}, {"Title": "Pramipexole augmentation in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder.", "Abstract": "Evaluation of: Cusin C, Iovieno N, Iosifescu DV et al. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pramipexole augmentation in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. J. Clin. Psychiatry 74(7), e636-e641 (2013). To overcome limited efficacy in antidepressants, clinicians may choose augmentation, switching to a different antidepressant, or a combination of different antidepressant drugs based on the individual patient's clinical circumstances. Among such options for difficult-to-treat major depressive disorder (MDD) patients, augmentation therapy with atypical antipsychotics, psychostimulants, dopamine agonists, serotonin 1A partial agonists, lithium, and thyroid hormones are commonly used in clinical practice. In fact, augmentation therapy has some clinical merits and is more convenient than switching medications and combination approaches for treating MDD. One such augmentation agent, pramipexole has been proposed, and has been implicated in the development and treatment of MDD. Recently, randomized controlled trials with pramipexole augmentation have been conducted and have demonstrated that pramipexole is a safe and potentially efficacious augmentation strategy. This article will discuss currently available clinical trial data and the potential role of pramipexole in MDD treatment, including clinical significance, limitations, and future research directions."}, {"Title": "Risk of subsequent attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder in children with febrile seizures.", "Abstract": "In this study, we obtained relevant data from a nationwide cohort database to investigate the risk of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children with a history of febrile seizures (FS).\nWe identified 1081 children with FS as the case cohort, and the date of diagnosis was used as an index date. Four controls were matched randomly with each case based on age, sex, urbanisation level, parents' occupation, and index date. We applied Cox's proportional hazards regression to estimate the HR and CI of FS-associated ADHD.\nAfter 11 years of follow-up, the incidence of ADHD for the FS and control cohorts is 7.83 and 4.72 per 1000 person-years, respectively. The FS cohort was 1.66 times more at risk of ADHD occurrence (95% CI 1.27 to 2.18) than the control cohort. The risk of developing ADHD increased in conjunction with the frequency of FS-related visits.\nFS may increase the risk of subsequent ADHD occurrence in children.

This Review provides an overview of the extensive literature concerning this topic and discusses the quality of the evidence to date. Globus has been associated with oropharyngeal structural lesions, upper oesophageal sphincter disorders, oesophageal disorders, GERD, psychosocial factors and psychiatric comorbidity. However, findings are often contradictory and the literature remains highly inconclusive. Indeed, with the exception of patients with structural-based globus, the Rome III criteria for functional globus only apply to a subgroup of patients with idiopathic globus. In clinical reality, there exists a group of patients who present with idiopathic (nonstructural) globus, but nevertheless have dysphagia, odynophagia or GERD-exclusion criteria for globus diagnosis according to Rome III. The symptomatology of patients with globus might be broader than previously thought. It is therefore crucial to approach globus not from one single perspective, but from a multifactorial point of view, with focus on the coexistence and/or interactions of different mechanisms in globus pathogenesis. This approach could be translated to clinical practice by adopting a multidisciplinary method to patients presenting with globus."}, {"Title": "School-associated problem behavior in childhood and adolescence and development of adult schizotypal symptoms: a follow-up of a clinical cohort.", "Abstract": "How school-associated behavioral problems in childhood and adolescence precede distinctive adult schizotypal symptoms was examined.

After 11.6 (SD\u2009=\u20093.1) years, 159 patients of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of the University Medical Centre Utrecht, the Netherlands were reassessed for adult schizotypal symptoms. Severity of behavioral symptoms in childhood and adolescence using Teacher Report Form (TRF; Verhulst et al. 1997) and adult schizotypal symptoms using Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Revised (Raine in Schizophrenia Bulletin 17:555-564, 1991) were examined by Spearman's bivariate correlations. Multiple regression analyses were performed to determine the combined predictive value of significant TRF subscales for schizotypal symptomatology. Moderation was tested by adding the interactions of gender with TRF subscales to the models. Disregarding gender, correlational analyses revealed that TRF Total problems, in specific thought problems, social problems, and attentional problems were associated with disorganized schizotypal symptoms in adult life. TRF thought problems was also associated with future positive schizotypal symptoms. When gender was taken into account, for boys only thought problems was associated with adult positive schizotypal symptoms, whereas for girls externalizing problems, specifically attentional and aggressive problems, were associated with the higher levels of adult disorganized schizotypal symptoms. Moderated regression analyses provided trend significant evidence confirming that in girls externalizing problems were positively associated with general and disorganized schizotypal symptoms.

However, declining funding and other issues prevent many residency programs from offering robust community psychiatry training to all of their residents.

We cataloged US psychiatry residency programs offering Community Psychiatry Tracks by reviewing the literature and surveying training directors and members of the American Association of Community Psychiatrists. Authors from each of the four programs found to be actively offering such tracks describe their track curricula, from which we elucidated common and variable elements as well as strengths and weaknesses and then make recommendations for other programs wishing to start a track.

These symptoms are most commonly part of the disease spectrum owing to pathological changes within relevant brain regions. Neuropsychiatric problems include disorders of cognition, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, psychotic symptoms, including, most commonly, well-formed visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions, and mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety. The other common cause of neuropsychiatric problem is secondary to use of dopaminergic drugs. Some PD patients may develop behavioral disorders, including impulse control disorders (ICDs) and addictive symptoms. Psychosis can be due to a mixture of underlying pathology, with triggering or worsening of symptoms with changes to PD medications. Currently, management of these disorders primarily uses therapies developed for general psychiatry and cognitive neurology, rather than specifically for PD. However, significant adverse effects, such as worsening of the motor symptoms of PD, can limit use of some drug therapies. Identification of drug-induced symptoms, such as ICDs, enables withdrawal of the offending drug as the principal management strategy. Research is ongoing in an effort to develop more specific therapies for PD-related neuropsychiatric symptoms."}, {"Title": "Agreement between DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria for opioid use disorders in two Iranian samples.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the agreement between the two systems in opioid users in the general population and a clinical sample. Two series of data were used in this study. The first was the data of 236 home-residing opioid abusers aged 15-64, who had previously participated in the Iran Mental Health Survey (IranMHS) in 2011, and the second was the data of 104 general psychiatry patients from inpatient or outpatient wards of two psychiatry hospitals in Tehran. Opioid use disorders were evaluated with CIDI-version 2.1. The disorders were assessed in all participants who used opioid substances for at least 5 times during the past 12months. In the sample from the general population, the agreement between the two systems on the diagnosis of dependence was excellent (0.81). The agreement between the two systems on the diagnosis of abuse and harmful use was 0.41. In the clinical sample, the agreement between the two systems on the diagnosis of dependence or any opioid use disorder was 0.96 and 0.93, respectively. The agreement between abuse and harmful use was 0.9 and -0.02 with and without regarding hierarchy, respectively. The inter-rater reliability of both DSM-IV and ICD-10 systems for all diagnosis was more than 0.95. The results of the diagnosis of dependence in the two systems had a weak concordance with treatment. The diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV and ICD-10 regarding dependence are very similar and the diagnosis produced by each system is concordant with the other system. However, the two systems have noticeable discrepancies in the diagnosis of abuse and harmful use. The discrepancies result from their conceptual differences and necessitate further revision in the definition of these disorders in the two systems."}, {"Title": "The madness of Gerard de Nerval.", "Abstract": "This paper examines the madness of Gerard de Nerval, the nineteenth-century French writer. It looks at his account of mental disturbance, how he responded to the psychiatric profession and how he reacted to being diagnosed as insane. It considers his autobiographical novella of madness, Aurelia, which he began at the suggestion of his alienist, Dr Emile Blanche, and while he was still an asylum inmate. Nerval's story raises important questions about the nature of madness. Is it, as he contended, a mystical experience revealing truths about spiritual worlds inaccessible to the 'sane'? Does psychiatry fail to understand it and inappropriately reduce it to the categories of scientific reason? Or are such notions of the spiritual value of madness guilty of the charge that they romanticise insanity? Do they make extravagant claims for an experience that is often disturbing and debilitating? What is the relationship between madness and recovery? Should an individual try to forget their experience of mental disturbance once they recover, or should they examine what the event reveals about themselves? Can the language of madness be decoded to unveil profound truths as Carl Jung and R.D. Laing have suggested, or is it, as the psychiatrist German Berrios maintains, merely a series of 'empty speech acts', signifying nothing? And finally, how does one avoid writing about madness, and instead write madness?"}, {"Title": "Dissociative identity disorder among adolescents: prevalence in a university psychiatric outpatient unit.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of dissociative identity disorder (DID) and other dissociative disorders among adolescent psychiatric outpatients. A total of 116 consecutive outpatients between 11 and 17 years of age who were admitted to the child and adolescent psychiatry clinic of a university hospital for the 1st time were evaluated using the Adolescent Dissociative Experiences Scale, adolescent version of the Child Symptom Inventory-4, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and McMaster Family Assessment Device. All patients were invited for an interview with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D) administered by 2 senior psychiatrists in a blind fashion. There was excellent interrater reliability between the 2 clinicians on SCID-D diagnoses and scores. Among 73 participants, 33 (45.2%) had a dissociative disorder: 12 (16.4%) had DID, and 21 (28.8%) had dissociative disorder not otherwise specified. There was no difference in gender distribution, childhood trauma, or family dysfunction scores between the dissociative and nondissociative groups. Childhood emotional abuse and family dysfunction correlated with self-reported dissociation. Of the dissociative adolescents, 93.9% had an additional psychiatric disorder. Among them, only separation anxiety disorder was significantly more prevalent than in controls. Although originally designed for adults, the SCID-D is promising for diagnosing dissociative disorders in adolescents, its modest congruence with self-rated dissociation and lack of relationship between diagnosis and childhood trauma and family dysfunction suggest that the prevalence rates obtained with this instrument originally designed for adults must be replicated. The introduction of diagnostic criteria for adolescent DID in revised versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, would refine the assessment of dissociative disorders in this age group."}, {"Title": "Perinatal maternal life events and psychotic experiences in children at twelve years in a birth cohort study.", "Abstract": "International studies indicate that the median prevalence of psychotic experiences in children is 7%.

Intensive research efforts for specific and sensitive biological markers, or biomarkers, for psychopathology as objective alternatives to the current paradigm are ongoing. While biomarker research in psychiatry has focused largely on functional neuroimaging methods for identifying the neural functions that associate with psychopathology, scalp electroencephalography (EEG) has been viewed, historically, as offering little specific brain source information, as scalp appearance is only loosely correlated to its brain source dynamics. However, ongoing advances in signal processing of EEG data can now deliver functional EEG brain-imaging with distinctly improved spatial, as well as fine temporal, resolution. One computational approach proving particularly useful for EEG cortical brain imaging is independent component analysis (ICA). ICA decomposition can be used to identify distinct cortical source activities that are sensitive and specific to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Given its practical research advantages, relatively low cost, and ease of use, EEG-imaging is now both feasible and attractive, in particular for studies involving the large samples required by genetically informative designs to characterize causal pathways to psychopathology. The completely non-invasive nature of EEG data acquisition, coupled with ongoing advances in dry, wireless, and wearable EEG technology, makes EEG-imaging increasingly attractive and appropriate for psychiatric research, including the study of developmentally young samples. Applied to large genetically and developmentally informative samples, EEG imaging can advance the search for robust diagnostic biomarkers and phenotypes in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[\"Shock\" therapies in Nazi Germany.

Here we utilize random forest classification and pre-treatment functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD) to generate individual subject treatment outcome predictions. Before cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), 48 adults (25 GAD and 23 PD) reduced (via cognitive reappraisal) or maintained their emotional responses to negative images during fMRI scanning. CBT responder status was predicted using activations from 70 anatomically defined regions. The final random forest model included 10 predictors contributing most to classification accuracy. A similar analysis was conducted using the clinical and demographic variables. Activations in the hippocampus during maintenance and anterior insula, superior temporal, supramarginal, and superior frontal gyri during reappraisal were among the best predictors, with greater activation in responders than non-responders. The final fMRI-based model yielded 79% accuracy, with good sensitivity (0.86), specificity (0.68), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (2.73, 0.20). Clinical and demographic variables yielded poorer accuracy (69%), sensitivity (0.79), specificity (0.53), and likelihood ratios (1.67, 0.39). This is the first use of random forest models to predict treatment outcome from pre-treatment neuroimaging data in psychiatry. Together, random forest models and fMRI can provide single-subject predictions with good test characteristics. Moreover, activation patterns are consistent with the notion that greater activation in cortico-limbic circuitry predicts better CBT response in GAD and PD."}, {"Title": "Assessing for unique immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles of physical activity subtypes: a focus on psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Physical activity (PA) is emerging as a safe and effective tool in the prevention and treatment of psychiatric disorders. PA subtypes include aerobic, resistance, flexibility, neuromotor (involving balance, agility and co-ordination), mind-body (e.g. tai chi, qi gong and yoga) and mixed type trainings. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that PA subtypes can have positive clinical effects, however the effects on the symptomatology may vary according to the PA subtype. It therefore stands to reason that various PA subtypes may modulate the immune system and neuroplastic processes differently. This systematic review aims to assess the immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles of various PA subtypes, particularly in unipolar depression and age-related cognitive decline (ARCD). The literature suggests several unique immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles for PA subtypes (i.e. resistance, aerobic and mind-body) in depression and ARCD. In depression, levels of various cytokines at baseline may predict treatment response to subtypes of PA and pharmacological agents. The pro-neuroplastic effects of resistance and aerobic PA in ARCD may differ due to variances in neurotrophin profiles. At this stage of literature in the field, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the specific immunomodulatory and neuroplastic pathways involved in these PA subtypes given of the small number of comparative studies and methodological heterogeneity between studies (e.g. study population age and illness severity, as well as duration and intensity of PA intervention).

Although proposals have met with some support, there have also been detractors. The history of fitness to plead is reviewed and current case law (including the 1836 Pritchard criteria) is examined. Although existing arrangements have been criticised, this may be attributable to inconsistent practical application, rather than inherent conceptual flaws. The Pritchard test has largely stood the test of time and has emerged relatively unscathed. Fitness to plead is not a medical construct, but rather a legal entity and any new test would be likely to introduce its own difficulties. A capacity based assessment could enhance debate and disagreement and increase court time in many cases, presenting new resource implications with questionable benefit. As the existing Pritchard criteria, amended by case law, already include a five limb test that closely resembles a capacity assessment (ability to plead to the indictment, to understand the course of the proceedings, to instruct a lawyer, to challenge a juror and to understand the evidence) and given the difficulties in introducing a functional test format in other jurisdictions, the Law Commission's proposals should now be set aside, perhaps for another day: reconsideration may be possible some decades hence, pending enhanced scientific developments within psychiatry and better understanding of the mind."}, {"Title": "[Deaf patients in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Prelingual deafness has multiple and far reaching consequences for the development of language, cognition and the psychosocial dimension.

This study aimed to identify factors that predict distress across three groups with anomalous experiences.\nThis study used a cross-sectional design. Participants in 'Diagnosed' (n = 35), 'At Risk' (n = 20), and 'Undiagnosed' (n = 36) groups completed the Appraisals of Anomalous Experiences Interview (AANEX; Brett et al., 2007, Br. J.

A series of ordinal logistic regression analyses was conducted to investigate which variables predicted anomaly-related distress.\nPredictors of higher distress were anomalous states characterized by changes in awareness and cognitive functioning (rather than more typical positive symptoms), appraisals of experiences as caused by 'other people', and greater attempted control over experiences. Predictors of lower distress were 'spiritual' appraisals, greater perceived social support/understanding, greater perceived controllability, and reacting with a 'neutral response'.\nWhile psychotic-like experiences themselves are not necessarily distressing, appraisals and responses to anomalies do predict distress, as do factors relating to the social context.

The documents founds reveal that, apart from the persons already identified, Halle/Saale - based hygienist Karlheinz Renker was deeply involved in the preparation of this event. They also show that for ideological reasons the GDR Ministry of Health restricted the number of participants from non-socialist countries, in particular Western Germany, to be admitted. Finally, the sources suggest that a volume compiling all talks given at the symposium as one publication and as such making its content and resolutions known to a wider public failed, among other reasons, due to the fact that Karl Leonhard, then head of the GDR Association for Psychiatry and Neurology, was \"not interested\" in it."}, {"Title": "Review of psychiatric services to mentally disordered offenders around the Pacific Rim.", "Abstract": "This article was commissioned to collate and review forensic psychiatric services provided in a number of key Pacific Rim locations in the hope that it will assist in future dialogue about service development. The Board of the Pacific Rim College of Psychiatrists identified experts in forensic psychiatry from Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, and the US. Each contributor provided an account of issues in their jurisdiction, including mental health services to mentally disordered offenders in prison, competence or fitness to stand trial, legal insanity as a defense at trial, diminished responsibility, and special forensic services available, including forensic hospitals and community forensic mental health services. Responses have been collated and are presented topic by topic and country by country within the body of this review. The availability of mental health screening and psychiatric in-reach or forensic liaison services within prisons differed considerably between countries, as did provisioning of community forensic mental health and rehabilitation services. Diversion of mentally disordered offenders to forensic, state, or hybrid hospitals was common. Legal constructs of criminal responsibility (insanity defense) and fitness to stand trial (\"disability\") are almost universally recognized, although variably used. Disparities between unmet needs and resourcing available were common themes. The legislative differences between contributing countries with respect to the mental health law and criminal law relating to mentally disordered offenders are relatively subtle. The major differences lie in operationalizing and resourcing forensic services."}, {"Title": "MAP as a model for practice-based learning and improvement in child psychiatry training.", "Abstract": "Not only is there a growing literature demonstrating the positive outcomes that result from implementing evidence based treatments (EBTs) but also studies that suggest a lack of delivery of these EBTs in \"usual care\" practices. One way to address this deficit is to improve the quality of psychotherapy teaching for clinicians-in-training. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requires all training programs to assess residents in a number of competencies including Practice-Based Learning and Improvements (PBLI). This article describes the piloting of Managing and Adapting Practice (MAP) for child psychiatry fellows, to teach them both EBT and PBLI skills. Eight child psychiatry trainees received 5 full days of MAP training and are delivering MAP in a year-long outpatient teaching clinic. In this setting, MAP is applied to the complex, multiply diagnosed psychiatric patients that present to this clinic. This article describes how MAP tools and resources assist in teaching trainees each of the eight required competency components of PBLI, including identifying deficits in expertise, setting learning goals, performing learning activities, conducting quality improvement methods in practice, incorporating formative feedback, using scientific studies to inform practice, using technology for learning, and participating in patient education. A case example illustrates the use of MAP in teaching PBLI. MAP provides a unique way to teach important quality improvement and practice-based learning skills to trainees while training them in important psychotherapy competence."}, {"Title": "Glioblastoma treatment using perphenazine to block the subventricular zone's tumor trophic functions.", "Abstract": "We present here a potential new treatment adjunct for glioblastoma. Building on murine studies, a series of papers appeared recently showing that therapeutic irradiation of the ipsilateral subventricular zone (SVZ) retards growth of more peripherally growing cortical glioblastomas in humans, suggesting a tumor trophic function for the SVZ. Further studies showed that SVZ cells migrate out towards a peripheral glioblastoma. Dopamine signaling through D3 subtype receptor indirectly drives this centrifugal migration in humans. Since psychiatry has several drugs with good D3 blocking attributes, such as fluphenazine, or perphenazine, we suggest that adding one of these D3 blocking drugs to current standard treatment of resection followed by temozolomide and irradiation might prolong survival by depriving glioblastoma of the trophic functions previously subserved by dopaminergic signaling on SVZ cells."}, {"Title": "When psychiatric diagnosis becomes an overworked tool.", "Abstract": "A psychiatric diagnosis today is asked to serve many functions-clinical, research, medicolegal, delimiting insurance coverage, service planning, defining eligibility for state benefits (eg, for unemployment or disability), as well as providing rallying points for pressure groups and charities. These contexts require different notions of diagnosis to tackle the particular problem such a designation is meant to solve. In a number of instances, a 'status' definition (ie, a diagnostic label or category) is employed to tackle what is more appropriately seen as requiring a 'functional' approach (ie, how well the person is able to meet the demands of a test of performance requiring certain capabilities, aptitudes or skills). In these instances, a diagnosis may play only a subsidiary role. Some examples are discussed: the criteria for involuntary treatment; the determination of criminal responsibility; and, assessing entitlements to state benefits. I suggest that the distinction between 'status' versus 'function' has not been given sufficient weight in discussions of diagnosis. It is in the functional domain that some of the problematic relationships between clinical psychiatry and the social institutions with which it rubs shoulders are played out. A status, signified by a diagnosis, has often been encumbered with demands for which it is poorly equipped. It is a reductive way of solving problems of management, allocation or disposal for which a functional approach should be given greater weight."}, {"Title": "The prevalence and recognition rate of delirium in hospitalized elderly patients in Turkey.", "Abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed, but generally under recognized in elderly hospitalized patients. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of delirium in elderly patients hospitalized at a university hospital, and to determine the recognition rate by hospital staff during hospitalization.\nThe study included 108 consecutive patients aged \u2265 65 years that were hospitalized in the medical and surgical inpatient departments at Ba\u015fkent University Hospital, Ankara, Turkey. All the patients were evaluated using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) upon admission and Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) on a daily basis during hospitalization. Written documents and consultation requests from psychiatry and/or neurology departments were reviewed for recognition of delirium by hospital staff.\nAmong the 108 patients in the study, delirium was noted in 18 (16.7%) during their hospital stay. Consultation from psychiatry or neurology departments was requested for 5 of the 18 patients, only 1 with a delirium diagnosis, indicating that 17 of the cases (94.4%) were not recognized by their primary physicians.\nThe delirium non-recognition rate in elderly hospitalized patients was very high.

The following data were analysed: method of suicide, account of prior psychiatric history and medication, as well as the acute psychiatric diagnosis and treatment - including pharmacotherapy.\nMost of the patients were diagnosed with a psychiatric illness. Major depressive disorder was the most frequent diagnosis in consultation. Treatment recommendations more often entailed further psychiatric treatment than medication. In the cases where medication was indeed given, benzodiazepines were the most frequently prescribed.\nMost of the suicide attempters needed further therapy in psychiatric hospitals. A specialised pharmacotherapy (antidepressants, mood stabilisers) was rarely recommended by the psychiatric consultation service.

The majority of antipsychotic medications are associated with obesity and heightened diabetes risk. People with severe mental illness less frequently achieve benchmarked diabetes care, often attributed to poor adherence, lower clinical attendance and documented medical biases in treatment. This case is presented to highlight the profound effect medication change can have on diabetes control.\nA 56-year-old man with a 42-year history of schizophrenia had required clozapine treatment for the preceding 14 years. Type 2 diabetes and obesity occurred within 4 years of clozapine instigation. Glycaemic control had been continuously poor, despite frequent contact with diabetes services and multiple medications, including insulin at a dose exceeding 200 IU daily. Request for consideration of antipsychotic review and close interaction with the psychiatry team was initiated at the diabetes outpatient clinic. A gradual medication switch from clozapine to aripiprazole was associated with a reduction in HbA(1c) from 80 to 50 mmol/mol (9.5 to 6.7%) over 4 months, associated with a weight loss of 10 kg. Over the ensuing 2 years, the improvement in HbA(1c) has endured, with total weight loss of 13 kg and halving of insulin requirements.\nThis case illustrates the benefits of engagement between endocrinologists and psychiatrists to achieve the shared goal of improved physical health in severe mental illness. Greater interdisciplinary collaboration will help bridge the life-expectancy gap in severe mental illness and may assist in preventing disabling diabetes complications in this vulnerable patient group."}, {"Title": "Revisiting formulation: part 1.

It re-establishes this as a problematic to be understood and reviews its intellectual history, its rationale, the tools of reasoning that it requires and the nature of the challenges that it can pose to individuals. Its premise is that an understanding of the theoretical basis of formulation is required prior to application of pedagogical tools in teaching and remediation. Four tasks of formulation implied in the definition provided in the RANZCP Formulation Guidelines for Candidates are identified, and their rationale and theoretical status reviewed.\nTask 1, classification, must address both diagnoses and problems. Task 2, using theory to infer meaning, ideally requires multiple models and theories in development of a set of hypotheses, using inductive inference (plausibility). Task 3, prioritising hypotheses, requires abduction, defined as inference to the best explanation. Task 4, integrating hypotheses, may aim for reconciling systems (syncretism), but is likely to use the more problematic eclecticism.

These patients accounted for 39.2% of all restraint episodes during the two-year study period. Adjusted binary logistic regression analyses showed that the odds for being frequently restrained were 91% lower among patients above 50 years compared to those aged 18-29 years; a threefold increase (OR=3.1) for those admitted 3 times or more compared to patients with only one stay; and, finally, a threefold increase (OR=3.1) if the length of stay was 16 days or more compared to those admitted for 0-4 days. Among frequently restrained patients, males (n=15) had significantly longer stays than women (n=19), and 8 of the females had a diagnosis of personality disorder, compared to none among males. Our study showed that being frequently restrained was associated with long inpatient stay, many admissions and young age. Teasing out patient characteristics associated with the risk of being frequently restraint may contribute to reduce use of restraint by developing alternative interventions for these patients."}, {"Title": "Psychometric properties and validation of the Reasons for Living Inventory in an outpatient clinical population in Malaysia.", "Abstract": "The Reasons For Living Inventory has been shown to have good psychometric properties in Western populations for the past three decades.

The RFL is designed to assess an individual's various reasons for not committing suicide. A total of 483 participants (283 with psychiatric illnesses and 200 with non-psychiatric medical illnesses) completed the RFL and other self-report instruments. Results of the EFA (exploratory factor analysis) and CFA (confirmatory factor analysis) supported the fit for the six-factor oblique model as the best-fitting model. The internal consistency of the RFL was \u03b1=.94 and it was found to be high with good concurrent, criterion and discriminative validities.

Although the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a commonly used screening method, further research is needed on its validity and norms for young children.\nThe aims of the study were to confirm the adjusted lower (normal/borderline) and upper (borderline/abnormal) cut-offs for the SDQ in a Finnish community sample of 4-9-year-old children, and to explore the SDQ's ability to identify the children with mental health problems.\nParents and teachers completed the SDQs (n = 2666). The Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) was administered to parents and teachers of 646 children.\nThe overall participation rate was 57%. The suggested cut-offs for the SDQ total difficulties scale rated by parents and teachers were 2-5 points lower than the corresponding published British norms. The sensitivity for the total score normal/borderline cut-off (9/10) was 76% in the parent and 66% in the teacher reports and for the borderline/abnormal cut-off (11/12) 90% and 70% respectively. The respective specificity values were 69%, 63%, 74% and 66%. The area under curve (AUC) values of the higher cut-offs were good for parent (0.87) and satisfactory for teacher rated (0.76) total scores. The presence of a DAWBA-rater assigned diagnosis in the abnormal group compared with the normal group was sixfold in the parent and threefold in the teacher reported SDQs.\nThe suggested cut-offs were clearly lower than the British norms. Yet the properties of the method's discriminative validity were acceptable. Population specific norms, taking into account both the culture and children's age, seem necessary for screening and for international comparisons of the method's validity properties."}, {"Title": "Which factors influence the appropriateness of testosterone-lowering medications for sex offenders? A survey among clinicians from German forensic-psychiatric institutions.", "Abstract": "Although testosterone-lowering medications (TLM) are a frequently used addition to psychotherapy in sex offender treatment, discord still seems to exist amongst clinicians as to in which cases administering TLM is justified. The depo-Provera scale (DPS), which was published by Maletzky and Field (Aggress Violent Behav 2003;8:391), assesses the appropriateness of TLM administration in sex offender treatment.\nThe DPS was sent to all forensic psychiatric institutions in Germany. The clinical directors of these institutions were asked to rate the importance of each item of the DPS on a six-point Likert scale.\nTwenty-nine clinicians participated. The most important reason selected for the prescription of TLM for sex offender treatment was a \"history of sexual offender treatment failure\". The least important item was \"deviant sexual interest, by plethysmograph or Abel Screen\" (neither plethysmograph nor Abel Screen is used in Germany).\nClinicians' attitudes towards the DPS correspond to the suggestions made in the current WSFBF-guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of sex offenders (Thibaut et al. 2010 ; World J Biol Psychiatry 11:604-655). Use of the DPS could therefore contribute to a more structured approach towards helping clinicians come to a decision about whether or not to treat a sex offender with TLM."}, {"Title": "Sadism in sexual offenders: evidence for dimensionality.", "Abstract": "Recurrent and intense sexual fantasies and urges that circle around the infliction of pain or humiliation on another human being may predispose individuals toward acts of sexual aggression against nonconsenting victims. Consequently, sexual sadism is a paraphilia with particular relevance for forensic psychology and psychiatry. Using behavioral indicators derived from crime scene actions as well as clinical data, we sought in the present study to identify the latent structure of the disorder. We analyzed data from a national sample of male sexual offenders from Austria (N = 1,020). In addition to latent profile analysis, 3 conceptually different taxometric methods were applied. The results of the analyses were more in accordance with a dimensional interpretation than with a categorical distinction. That is, sadistic conduct in sexual offenses is likely an extreme form of coercion, but not a qualitatively different entity. The implications with respect to the current debate on the diagnostic criteria for sadism are discussed."}, {"Title": "Analysis of the characteristics of interconsultations performed by emergency physicians to other hospital specialists and their evolution over time.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to describe the type of interconsultations carried out in the Emergency Department (ED) to hospital specialists and analyze their pattern over time.\nThe study was carried out during the period from 2006 to 2012. It was carried out at EDs attending to all types of interconsultations except pediatrics and obstetrics-gynecology. There were no changes in physical structure, number of personnel, or organization during the study period. The main measurements taken were as follows: monthly ED census, number of interconsultations and specialties consulted, main reason for presentation at the ED during the first (2006) and last year (2012), and, for specialties demonstrating substantial quantitative changes, main reasons for the interconsultation from the ED at the beginning (2006) and the end (2012) of the study. Linear regression analysis was carried out for the relationship between time and number of interconsultations.\nA total of 628 256 care interventions were carried out, with 128 008 interconsultations (20.4%). Orthopedic surgery and traumatology, psychiatry, and general and digestive surgery were the departments most frequently consulted (54.5% of the interconsultations). Consultations significantly reduced over time (R=0.29; P<0.001) but the percentage of interconsultations (related to ED census) remained unchanged (R=0.01; P=0.49). The behavior related to specialties was heterogeneous: consultations to general and digestive surgery, hematology and hemostasis, and urology specialists decreased, whereas to thoracic surgery, angiology and vascular surgery, neurology, nephrology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, orthopedic surgery and traumatology, and critical care medicine specialists increased. Some of the reasons for specialist consultation also significantly changed over time.\nThe study of interconsultations allows us to identify areas of lesser autonomy of emergency physicians. Changes in the pattern of these interconsultations over time may reflect both learning processes and changes in the healthcare circuits in the ED."}, {"Title": "The missing 'P' in pain management: how the current opioid epidemic highlights the need for psychiatric services in chronic pain care.", "Abstract": "The prevalence of opioid therapy for chronic noncancer pain has increased dramatically in recent years, with a parallel increase in opioid abuse, misuse and deaths from accidental overdose. We review epidemiological and clinical data that point to the important roles psychiatric disorders have in the use and abuse of opioids in patients with chronic pain.\nWe conducted literature searches on the PubMed with the key phrases \"chronic pain\" and \"opioid therapy\" and selected those articles on the epidemiology of comorbidity between chronic pain and psychiatric disorders, the trends in long-term opioid therapy and the clinical trials that involved using opioid therapy for chronic pain or for mental health disorders. We then thoroughly reviewed the bibliography of all relevant articles to identify additional papers to be included in the present review.\nChronic pain is highly comorbid with common psychiatric disorders. Patients with mental health and substance abuse disorders are more likely to receive long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain and more likely to have adverse outcomes from this therapy. Although opioids may exert brief antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in some patients with depression or anxiety, there is scant evidence for long-term benefit from opioid treatment of psychiatric disorders.\nOpioids may be used in current clinical practice as the de facto and only psychiatric treatment for patients with chronic pain, despite little evidence for sustained benefit. The opioid epidemic thus reflects a serious unmet need for better recognition and treatment of common mental health problems in patients with chronic pain.

Despite the well-recognized spectrum nature of affective disorders, modern anxiolytic drug discovery mainly targets specific pathways and molecular determinants within a single phenotypic domain. However, greater understanding of the integrative mechanisms and pathogenesis is essential in order to develop new effective therapies.\nIn this review, the authors emphasize the importance of a 'domain interplay-oriented' approach to experimental affective research. They also highlight the need to expand the scope of anxiolytic drug targets to better understand the pathogenesis of anxiety-spectrum disorders.\nThere is the potential to markedly improve the utility of animal models for affective disorders. First, the authors suggest that one such way would be by analyzing the systems of several domains and their interplay to better understand disease pathogenesis. Further, it could also be improved by expanding the range of model species and by extending the spectrum of anxiolytic drug targets; this would help to focus on emerging and unconventional systems to better develop new therapies."}, {"Title": "Evaluating the clinical effectiveness of a specialized perinatal psychiatry inpatient unit.", "Abstract": "Women experiencing severe perinatal mental illness during pregnancy or postpartum have unique needs when psychiatric hospitalization is indicated.

Symptoms of persistent anxiety were almost invariably associated with symptoms of depression. There were significant differences between classes in terms of history of depression and anxiety, use of psychoactive medication, and on the Mentation and Complications sections of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale.\nPatients with PD show different syndromic profiles of anxiety that do not align with the symptom profiles represented by DSM-IV anxiety disorders and major depression.

Poor sleep can attenuate emotional control, including the regulation of aggression, and thus, may increase the risk of impulsive, aggressive acts. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the potential contribution of sleep problems to subjective and objective aggressiveness and impulsivity in a forensic psychiatric population. Questionnaires on sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), chronic severe insomnia (Sleep Diagnosis List), aggressiveness (Aggression Questionnaire) and impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11) were completed by 96 forensic psychiatric inpatients, admitted to two forensic facilities in the Netherlands. To obtain more objective measurements of aggression and impulsivity, observational scores on a professional instrument to assess the risk of future aggression (Historical Clinical Future-30) and reported aggressive incidents were collected from files. Results showed that a worse sleep quality and higher insomnia scores were significantly associated with self-reported aggression and impulsivity, clinician-rated hostility and involvement in aggressive incidents within the facility. Whether a participant was professionally judged as impulsive could not be predicted by sleep quality or the insomnia score. To a large extent the results of this study support the hypothesis that poor sleep is related to impulsive, aggressive behavior in forensic psychiatric patients.

The origins of a controversy over the responsibility of the mentally ill in French forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "While some countries like Belgium chose a penal system clearly inspired by social-defense theories for mentally disturbed criminals, the French law hasn't been consistent and varies from the enlightened classical law and social-defense law. Indeed paragraph 1 of article 122-1 states that people whose discernment or control is abolished by a psychiatric disorder are non-responsible respecting the classical logic of law. On the other hand, Paragraph 2 of Article 122-1 allows the mentally ill to be judged responsible whereas no institution exists to take care about them. Then the system of psychiatric care in prisons present as a solution for professionals wishing to promote a system where people are punished and socially rehabilitated. Thus these forensic psychiatrists don't refer to paragraph 1 of article 122-1 and even people presenting serious mental disorders are considered responsible. Moreover, if a controversy has always existed between psychiatrists who argue a large conception of mental irresponsibility and professionals who defend the right to punish and to conclude that responsibility even for mentally disturbed criminals, the controversy becomes more important in French forensic psychiatry after the Second World War. If until the 1970s the practice of imposing responsibility for mentally ill individuals shows itself as a humanism, it occurs more within a security perspective today."}, {"Title": "Treatment as punishment: forensic psychiatry in The Netherlands (1870-2005).", "Abstract": "This article provides an overview of the development of forensic psychiatry in the Netherlands from the late nineteenth to the early twenty-first century. The first part addresses the ways forensic psychiatry established itself in the period 1870-1925 and focuses on its interrelatedness with forensic practice, psychiatry's professionalization, the role of the government, the influence of the so-called New Direction in legal thinking and (Italian and French) anthropology of crime, and the debates among physicians as well as between psychiatrists and legal experts on the proper approach of mentally disturbed offenders. From the mid-1920s on the so-called 'psychopaths laws' anchored forensic psychiatry in the Dutch legal system. The second part zooms in on the enactment of these laws, which formalized special measures for mentally disturbed delinquents. These implied a combination of sentencing and forced admission to and treatment in a mental institution or some other form of psychiatric surveillance. The article deals with the meaning, reach and consequences of this legislation, its debate by psychiatrists and legal experts, the number of delinquents affected, the offenses for which they were sentenced and the (therapeutic) regime in forensic institutions. The goal of the Dutch legislation on psychopaths was ambiguous: if it was designed to protect society against assumed dangerous criminals, at the same time they were supposed to receive psychiatric treatment to enable their return to regular social life again. These legal and medical objectives were at odds with each other and as a result discussions about collective versus individual interests as well as about the usefulness and the effects of this legislation kept flaring up. To this day the history of this legislation is characterized by the intrinsic tension between punishment and security on the one hand and treatment and re-socialization on the other.

In this article, we seek to chart the relationship between psychiatry and the principles and practices of criminal responsibility in the UK over the early modern, modern and late modern periods. With a focus on claims about authority and expert knowledge around criminal responsibility, we suggest that these claims have been in a state of perpetual negotiation and that, as a result, claims to authority over and knowledge about criminal non-responsibility on the part of psychiatrists and psychiatry are most accurately understood as emergent and contingent. The apparent formalism of legal discourse has tended to conceal the extent to which legal policy has been preoccupied with maintaining the primacy of lay judgments in criminal processes of evaluation and adjudication. While this policy has been somewhat successful in the context of the trial - particularly the murder trial - it has been undermined by administrative procedures surrounding the trial, including those that substitute treatment for punishment without, or in spite of, a formal determination of criminal responsibility."}, {"Title": "Progress in improving mental health services for racial-ethnic minority groups: a ten-year perspective.", "Abstract": "This study examined progress in making the mental health workforce more diverse and in better representing racial-ethnic minority groups in randomized intervention trials of common mental disorders since the publication of the U.S. Surgeon General's 2001 report Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity.\nData on the mental health workforce were drawn from a work group comprising research staff from the American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, and the National Association of Social Workers; representatives of professional psychiatric nursing; and staff from the National Institute of Mental Health. Additional data were pooled from clinical trials published between 2001 and 2010, which were examined for inclusion of racial-ethnic minority populations. Proquest, PubMed, and Google Scholar were searched for the terms \"clinical trials\" and \"randomized trials.\" The search was constrained to trials of adults with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depression, along with trials of children and adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nBetween 1999 and 2006, professionals from racial-ethnic minority groups increased from 17.6% to 21.4% in psychiatry, from 8.2% to 12.9% in social work, and from 6.6% to 7.8% in psychology. Reporting race-ethnicity in clinical trials has improved from 54% in 2001 to 89% in 75 studies of similar disorders published by 2010, although few ethnic-specific analyses are being conducted.\nLittle progress has been made in developing a more diverse workforce; racial-ethnic minority groups remain highly underrepresented. There is more representation of racial-ethnic minority populations in randomized intervention trials, but their numbers often remain too small to analyze. Recommendations for improving both areas are considered."}, {"Title": "Association of mediterranean diet with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "To conduct a systematic review of all studies to determine whether there is an association between the Mediterranean diet (MeDi) and cognitive impairment.\nWe conducted a comprehensive search of the major databases and hand-searched proceedings of major neurology, psychiatry, and dementia conferences through November 2012. Prospective cohort studies examining the MeDi with longitudinal follow-up of at least 1 year and reporting cognitive outcomes (mild cognitive impairment [MCI] or Alzheimer's disease [AD]) were included. The effect size was estimated as hazard-ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q-test and I2-statistic.\nOut of the 664 studies screened, five studies met eligibility criteria. Higher adherence to the MeDi was associated with reduced risk of MCI and AD. The subjects in the highest MeDi tertile had 33% less risk (adjusted HR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55-0.81; p < 0.0001) of cognitive impairment (MCI or AD) as compared to the lowest MeDi score tertile. Among cognitively normal individuals, higher adherence to the MeDi was associated with a reduced risk of MCI (HR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.96; p = 0.02) and AD (HR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46-0.89; p = 0.007). There was no significant heterogeneity in the analyses.\nWhile the overall number of studies is small, pooled results suggest that a higher adherence to the MeDi is associated with a reduced risk of developing MCI and AD, and a reduced risk of progressing from MCI to AD. Further prospective-cohort studies with longer follow-up and randomized controlled trials are warranted to consolidate the evidence.

Up to half of patients with a major depressive episode fail to achieve remission with a first line antidepressant treatment. Identification of the molecular mechanisms that dictate whether a patient will successfully respond to a particular antidepressant treatment while tolerating its side-effects is not only a major challenge in biological psychiatry research but is also one that shows great promise. This review summarises data from both clinical and preclinical studies that point to a role of specific genes in the response and resistance to antidepressant therapeutics. Moreover, we discuss how such findings have increased our understanding of the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs. Finally, we comment on how this information may potentially influence the future development of personalised medicine approaches for the treatment of depression."}, {"Title": "Children and adolescents in the Psychiatric Emergency Department: a 10-year survey in Copenhagen County.", "Abstract": "Knowledge on psychiatric emergencies in children and adolescents is limited.

The passing of two criminal codes, in 1842 and 1902 marks a development from neo-classical law to a law influenced by positivist criminology. In these consecutive ways of thinking law, the figure of the irresponsible criminal constituted a contentious issue. From being a figure marking the limits of the law, the irresponsible criminal became an object to be disciplined and a security threat. This redefinition of criminal responsibility created or was created by new groups of experts speaking from positions increasingly close to the criminals. The most important professional group was of course the psychiatrists, that emerged in Norway as a distinct professional group in the second half of the 19th century, and whose influence in the legislative process culminated in the 1920s."}, {"Title": "Psychiatrists, criminals, and the law: forensic psychiatry in Switzerland 1850-1950.", "Abstract": "Between 1880 and 1950, Swiss psychiatrists established themselves as experts in criminal courts. In this period, the judicial authorities required psychiatric testimonies in a rising number of cases. As a result, more offenders than ever before were declared mentally deficient and, eventually, sent to psychiatric asylums. Psychiatrists also enhanced their authority as experts at the political level. From the very beginning, they got involved in the preparatory works for a nationwide criminal code. In this article, I argue that these trends toward medicalization of crime were due to incremental processes, rather than spectacular institutional changes. In fact, Swiss psychiatrists gained recognition as experts due to their daily interactions with judges, public prosecutors, and legal counsels. At the same time, the spread of medical expertise had serious repercussions on psychiatric institutions. From 1942 onwards, asylums had to deal with a growing number of \"criminal psychopaths,\" which affected ward discipline and put psychiatry's therapeutic efficiency into question. The defensive way in which Swiss psychiatrists reacted to this predicament was crucial to the further development of forensic psychiatry. For the most part, it accounts for the subdiscipline's remarkable lack of specialization until the 1990s."}, {"Title": "Fathers' and mothers' ratings of behavioral and emotional problems in siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder.", "Abstract": "Debate is ongoing about whether typically developing siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at greater risk of behavioral or emotional problems than siblings of children without ASD.

The strengths and difficulties questionnaire (Goodman in J Child Psychol Psychiatry 38(5):581-586, 1997) was completed by 168 mothers and 130 fathers. Parents were more likely to rate siblings as having 'abnormal' behavior when compared to a normative population. We found moderate correlations between mother-father ratings.

The history of this relationship has been shaped by longstanding formal and informal systems of social regulation, by the contests of federal-provincial jurisdiction, by changing trends in the legal and psychiatric professions, and by amendments to the federal Criminal Code. A study of these longer-term features demonstrates that there has been no linear path of progress in Canada's response to mentally unwell offenders. Those caught in the web of crime and mental disorder have been cast and recast over the past 150 years by the changing dynamics of criminal law, psychiatry, and politics. A long historical perspective suggests how earlier and more contemporary struggles over mental disorder and criminality are connected, how these struggles are bound by historical circumstance, and how a few relatively progressive historical moments emerging from these struggles might be recovered, and theorized to advantage."}, {"Title": "Specialty experience in geriatric medicine is associated with a small increase in knowledge of delirium.", "Abstract": "delirium is underdiagnosed and undertreated.

From the mid-nineteenth century, Russia as a nation-state struggled to reform, collapsed, re-constituted itself in a bloody civil war, metastasized into a violent \"totalitarian\" regime, reformed and stagnated under \"mature socialism\" and then embraced capitalism and \"managed democracy\" at the end of the twentieth century. These upheavals had indelible effects on policing and the administration of justice, and on psychiatry's relationship with them. In Russia, physicians specializing in medicine of the mind had to cope with rapid and radical changes of legal and institutional forms, and sometimes, of the state itself. Despite this challenging environment, psychiatrists showed themselves to be active professionals seeking to guide the transformations that inevitably touched their work. In the second half of the nineteenth century debates about the role of psychiatry in criminal justice took place against a backdrop of increasingly alarming terrorist activity, and call for revolution. While German influence, with its preference for hereditarianism, was strong, Russian psychiatry was inclined toward social and environmental explanations of crime. When revolution came in 1917, the new communist regime quickly institutionalized forensic psychiatry. In the aftermath of revolution, the institutionalization of forensic psychiatry \"advanced\" with each turn of the state's transformation, with profound consequences for practitioners' independence and ethical probity. The abuses of Soviet psychiatry under Stalin and more intensively after his death in the 1960s-80s remain under-researched and key archives are still classified.

In this paper, we review the available literature in order to explore the public health significance of BD and the extent to which this may justify the development of early intervention strategies for this disorder.\nThe main computerized psychiatric literature databases were accessed. This included Medline and PsychInfo, using the following keywords: bipolar, early intervention, staging model, burden, caregiver, public health, and manic depression.\nBD is often recurrent and has an impact that goes well beyond symptomatic pathology. The burden it incurs is linked not only to its cardinal clinical features, but also to cognitive dysfunction, poor functional outcome, poor physical health, high rate of comorbidities, and suicide. At a societal level, BD induces enormous direct and indirect costs and has a major impact on caregivers. The available literature reveals a usually long delay between illness onset and the start of treatment, and the absence of specific guidelines for the treatment of the early phase of BD.\nConsidering the major impact of BD on patients and society, there is an urgent need for the development of early intervention strategies aimed at earlier detection and more specific treatment of the early phase of the disorder."}, {"Title": "Practitioner review: maternal mood in pregnancy and child development--implications for child psychology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The empirical base suggesting a link between prenatal maternal anxiety, stress or depression and cognitive, behavioral, and biological outcomes in the infant and child has increased dramatically in the past 10 years.\nIn this review, we consider the relevance of prenatal maternal mood for child mental health practitioners; the empirical base for a likely causal impact of the link between prenatal anxiety, depression, or stress and child outcomes; the degree to which the available evidence is sufficient for informing or altering clinical practice; and the possible role of prenatal interventions for promoting child health and development.

A secondary goal was to examine the effects of family history (FH) of alcohol use disorders (AUD) on acute alcohol response in both samples. Participants attended 2 randomized laboratory sessions in which they consumed 0.8\u00a0g/kg alcohol or a taste-masked placebo. At pre- and post-drink time points, participants completed subjective scales, psychomotor performance and eye-movement tasks, and provided salivary samples for cortisol determination.\nResults showed that the second cohort of heavy drinkers exhibited a nearly identical pattern of alcohol responses to the original cohort, including sensitivity to alcohol's stimulating and hedonically rewarding effects during the rising breath alcohol content (BrAC) limb, increases in sedation during the declining BrAC limb, a lack of cortisol response, and psychomotor and eye-tracking impairment that was most evident at peak BrAC. The magnitude and temporal pattern of these acute effects of alcohol in the second cohort were similar to the first cohort across all measures, with the exception of 3 eye-movement measures: pro- and antisaccade accuracy and antisaccade velocity. FH of AUD did not affect alcohol response in the first cohort, and this was replicated in the second cohort.\nIn sum, in 2 independent samples, we have demonstrated that HD display a consistent and reliable sensitivity to alcohol's subjective effects and impairment of eye-tracking and psychomotor performance, which is not affected by FH status.

Beginning at puberty, women develop mood disorders twice as often as men. Because corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors are implicated, we compared CRF receptor binding in pre- and postpubertal rats. In each brain area, CRF receptor binding was sexually dimorphic, but no two areas were alike in the way the sexes differed. In the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle, CRF1 binding was initially the same in juveniles, but became greater in adult females. In piriform cortex, CRF1 binding increased in females and decreased in males, again becoming sexually dimorphic. CRF1 binding in the anterior cingulate was greater in females than in males at both ages. In CA3, CRF1 binding was greater in males before puberty but decreased during puberty, abolishing the sex difference. CRF2 binding in the posterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis was greater in males irrespective of age. In contrast, in each of three subdivisions of the lateral septum, females had greater CRF2 binding than males as juveniles, or, as juveniles and as adults. CRF2 binding in the ventromedial hypothalamus was the same in juveniles, but binding levels increased in males, leading to an adult sex difference. Thus, eight CRF receptor-expressing areas displayed eight distinct sex differences. These results show that sex differences pervade the CRF receptor system in juvenile and adult rats, and the mechanisms that control them are likely to be sex-, region-, and subtype-specific."}, {"Title": "Training of child and adolescent psychiatry fellows in autism and intellectual disability.", "Abstract": "Patients with autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability can be clinically complex and often have limited access to psychiatric care.

The assessment is based on the therapists' data without an external validation. Main topics of the survey were characteristics of the supply of psychotherapeutic care, therapeutic time contingents per patient and their utilisation and demographic and socio-economic features of patients. Evaluating the survey, the results were analysed overall and by groups of therapists varying in demographic features, professional qualifications and regional criteria, using bivariate as well as multivariate methods.\nThe study provides evidence indicating an underprovision of outpatient psychotherapeutic care. Psychotherapists who use a waiting list reported average waiting times of more than 2.5 months. Additionally there are differences in psychotherapeutic care between various patient groups. In regions with lower population density we found less provision of psychotherapeutic care compared to regions with higher population density. Taking into account epidemiological data, the study indicates that the participation of men, persons of older age and patients with lower levels of education in psychotherapeutic care is below average.\nThe results suggest a considerable degree of underprovision and inadequate provision of outpatient psychotherapeutic care.

Specifically, PTSD can be conceptualized as a disorder of fear and stress dysregulation, and the neural circuitry underlying these pathways in both animals and humans are becoming increasingly well understood. Furthermore, PTSD is the only disorder in psychiatry in which the initiating factor, the trauma exposure, can be identified. Thus, the pathophysiology of the fear and stress response underlying PTSD can be examined and potentially interrupted. Twin studies have shown that the development of PTSD following a trauma is heritable, and that genetic risk factors may account for up to 30-40% of this heritability. A current goal is to understand the gene pathways that are associated with PTSD, and how those genes act on the fear/stress circuitry to mediate risk vs. resilience for PTSD. This review will examine gene pathways that have recently been analysed, primarily through candidate gene studies (including neuroimaging studies of candidate genes), in addition to genome-wide associations and the epigenetic regulation of PTSD. Future and on-going studies are utilizing larger and collaborative cohorts to identify novel gene candidates through genome-wide association and other powerful genomic approaches. Identification of PTSD biological pathways strengthens the hope of progress in the mechanistic understanding of a model psychiatric disorder and allows for the development of targeted treatments and interventions."}, {"Title": "Healthcare professionals' regard towards working with patients with substance use disorders: comparison of primary care, general psychiatry and specialist addiction services.", "Abstract": "Healthcare professionals are crucial in access to treatment for patients with substance use disorders. However, healthcare professionals often have negative attitudes towards this patient group. Healthcare professionals' regard for working with patients with substance use disorders was examined and three sectors in which professionals are working were compared.\nGeneral practitioners (GPs; N=180), healthcare professionals of general psychiatry (N=89) and specialists in addiction services (N=78) filled out a questionnaire in which regard for working with patients with substance use disorders was assessed. ANOVAs were used to compare the sectors and multiple linear regression analysis tested the association of regard with attribution beliefs, emotional reactions and other characteristics of healthcare professionals.\nRegard for working with patients with substance use disorders was different between the three sectors (GPs M=42.00; general psychiatry M=48.18; addiction specialists M=55.41; p=0.00, \u03c9(2)=0.40). Attribution of personal responsibility and feeling of anger and fear were associated with lower regard scores. More familiarity with substance use problems, higher frequency of working with this patients group and more confidence in substance abuse treatment were positively associated with regard. Social desirability bias was present and was positively related to healthcare professionals' regard.\nHealth care professionals of specialist addiction services showed higher regard for working with patients with substance use disorders compared to professionals of general psychiatry services and GPs. Improvement of education and shared care models in which healthcare professionals are supported by professionals specializing in addiction might address low regard."}, {"Title": "[Experience of liaison psychiatry in Morocco: transversal study over 24 months].", "Abstract": "Liaison psychiatry is a discipline caring for psychiatric disorders in patients of general hospitals. It involves clinical, educational, and research aspects. The liaison psychiatry supports patients hospitalized for full-time in medical and surgical departments, patients admitted in day-hospital and patients treated in the emergency department. In this transversal study, we assessed the liaison psychiatry impact that is still in development stage in Morocco. This study lasted 24 months, and was conducted at the University Hospital in Fez, Morocco.\nThe goal of this work was to evaluate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders managed by liaison psychiatry, identify those requiring medical and surgical departments of such psychiatric support, and classify the motivations involved in their needs.\nThis transversal study was initiated in January 2010 and has lasted 24 months. The study recruited 180 patients requiring psychiatric consultation from different medical and surgical departments at the University Hospital in Fes, Morocco. The psychiatric assessment was based on a psychiatric interview using the MINI. The data were collected by a certified psychiatrist using a questionnaire containing 24 items. After initial psychiatric assessment, the follow-up was proposed to the patient in the psychiatric department.\nDuring this study, 22 medical and surgical departments of our University Hospital had requested a psychiatric assessment for their patients. Most demands were respectively emitted by the Department of Dermatology (16%) and Nephrology (11%). The most common motivations for psychiatric consultations were respectively psychomotor agitation (17%) and an evaluation of suicide attempts (17%). Depressive and psychotic disorders were the most diagnosed disorders with 47% and 11% respectively. The psychiatric support was based on pharmacological treatment in 60% of cases. Finally, the outcome was favourable in 80% of followed cases.\nHospitalized patients in different medical and surgical departments of the University Hospital of Fez have demonstrated a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders. This constitutes a very strong motivation to setup a department of liaison psychiatry. This would allow a better psychiatric support and follow-up of patients."}, {"Title": "Current state of psychiatric involvement on palliative care consult services: results of a national survey.", "Abstract": "Palliative care consult services have emerged as an excellent resource for physicians seeking help with patients' symptoms. Symptoms include those of a psychiatric nature (e.g., depression, anxiety, delirium); however, little information is known about whether palliative care services include psychiatric input as part of multidisciplinary teams.\nTo explore 1) the current level of collaboration between psychiatrists and palliative care consult services across the U.S. and 2) the factors that support or restrict such involvement.\nA national survey was developed and distributed electronically to program directors identified in the National Palliative Care Registry maintained by the Center to Advance Palliative Care. Analyses examined trends in psychiatry involvement with hospital-based palliative care teams.\nThe survey had a 59% response rate, with final analyses including surveys completed by 260 palliative care program directors (67% inclusion rate from total respondents). Seventy-two percent of respondents reported some form of involvement with a psychiatrist on their palliative care service, with only 10% of those identifying a psychiatrist as a full- or part-time member of the team. Most respondents reported that they would like psychiatrists to be more involved with the palliative care services (71%). Secondary analyses of qualitative responses identified common impediments to increased psychiatry involvement, which included financial constraints, provider interest, and perceived disciplinary disconnect.\nThere are shared objectives between psychiatry and palliative care; however, currently, co-involvement on treatment teams is quite limited. Future research is needed to identify ways to facilitate the interface of palliative care and psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Influenza outbreaks management in a French psychiatric hospital from 2004 to 2012.", "Abstract": "Influenza epidemics can have consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality for the patients.

The study of the episodes with confirmed influenza cases was carried out.\nInfluenza monitoring and alert were essential with information and laboratory-confirmed cases. Influenza was common with a total of 20 episodes for the studied period. A maximum of 25% (5/20) of the units were affected in 2008-2009. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests allowed a quick identification with an average time of 1.5 days. Mainly, control measures limited the spread of the influenza virus in units with patient not at high risk of complications.

The creation of court-ordered treatment is based on the premise that many offenders have psychiatric disorders. If the court-ordered treatment is appraised as an effective way to prevent recidivism by the lawmaker, the preeminent role of psychiatry, in the prevention of recidivism has generated controversy in the psychiatric community. Few studies have been conducted on court-ordered treatment in France, and have concerned epidemiological measures. Court-ordered treatment leads to an extension of the expert's mission. In order to prevent recidivism, the interest of a treatment is a new part of the expert's mission.\nThe main purpose of this study was to assess the kind of diagnosis reported by the forensic psychiatrist who considered the court-ordered treatment as appropriate.\nWe led a descriptive and retrospective study among the experts' reports of 68\u00a0subjects followed by three psychiatrists. We categorized each diagnosis found in the experts' reports in reference to DSM-IV-TR axis\u00a0I and axis\u00a0II. As the expert has no obligation to refer to the DSM-IV-TR, we also considered the \"no DSM-IV-TR categorized disorder\" as a category. The primary outcome was the proportion of each diagnosis category in experts' reports, in which the forensic psychiatrist agreed with the indication of a court-ordered treatment.\nWe analysed 123\u00a0experts' reports in which the mission was to diagnose a mental disorder and to assess the need for a court-ordered treatment. The expert agreed with the need for a court-ordered treatment in 112\u00a0reports. In those reports the diagnosis was \"no disorder\" in 27% of them, \"no DSM-IV-TR categorized disorder\" in 26% of them, \"axis II disorder\" in 24% of them, \"axis I disorder\" in 19% of them, and \"association of an axis I and an axis II disorder\" in 4% of them.\nThe diagnoses were heterogeneous. Their associations with the need for a court-ordered treatment seem to be contradictory when considering the association between \"no mental disorder\" and \"need for a court-ordered treatment\" found in 27% of the reports. These paradoxical results led us to question the meaning of mental disorder and treatment."}, {"Title": "Increased serum prolactin levels in drug-naive first-episode male patients with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Prolactin is a hormone receiving considerable attention in psychiatry. Increased serum prolactin level is frequently associated with dopamine blocking antipsychotics. Furthermore, decreased prolactin level was considered a reflector of the effect of antipsychotics. However, there is restricted numbers of investigations that researched baseline prolactin levels in first-episode patients with schizophrenia.\nWe purpose to investigate serum baseline prolactin levels in drug-naive first-episode patients with schizophrenia (FES) and to explore the differences in serum prolactin levels between FES, drug-free schizophrenic patients (DFS) and healthy controls (HC).\nThe study was conducted in the Departments of Psychiatry, G\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131 Hasvak and K\u0131rklareli State Hospitals, Turkey. Thirty male FES, 41 male DFS and 32 male HC were included in study. All participants were clinically examined and individually interviewed. Before initiating any pharmacological treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected to measure serum prolactin levels between 08:00 and 10:00 h, which was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Prolactin levels were also collected from the consenting HC using the same assay.\nThe mean age was higher in the DFS group. The mean score of Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale was higher in the FES group and mean score of Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms was higher in the DFS group. The mean value of prolactin was higher in the FES group (34.1 \u00b1 19.9 ng/dl) compared with DFS (17.9 \u00b1 6.5 ng/dl) and HC (9.7 \u00b1 2.3 ng/dl) (F = 35.5, P < 0.001). Additionally, the mean value of serum prolactin is higher in the DFS group compared with HC (P < 0.001).\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate higher serum prolactin levels in male FES compared with male DFS and male HC.

As hypothesized, participants from the general Egyptian population were more likely to endorse supernatural causal explanation of their SP compared to participants from Denmark; participants from the American University in Cairo were less likely to endorse supernatural causes of their SP compared to participants from the general Egyptian population. Moreover, participants from the American University in Cairo were marginally significantly more likely to endorse supernatural causes of their SP compared to participants from Denmark. Additionally, we explored which culturally bound explanations and beliefs about SP existed in Egypt and Denmark. We found that nearly half (48%) of the participants from the general Egyptian population believed their SP to be caused by the Jinn, a spirit-like creature with roots in Islamic tradition, which constitutes a culturally bound interpretation of the phenomenology of SP in this region of the world.

This can be adequately reconstructed by focusing on the establishment of specialized journals, societies, university chairs, the invention and application of specific instruments, medical practices, and certainly also the publication of pivotal textbooks in the field. Particularly around 1900, the German-speaking countries played an integral role in this process. In this article, one aspect is extensively explored, notably the publication (in the twentieth century) of three comprehensive and influential multivolume and multiauthor handbooks entirely devoted to neurology. All available volumes of Max Lewandowsky's Handbuch der Neurologie (1910-1914) and the Handbuch der Neurologie (1935-1937) of Oswald Bumke and Otfrid Foerster were analyzed. The handbooks were then compared with Pierre Vinken's and George Bruyn's Handbook of Clinical Neurology (1968-2002). Over the span of nearly a century these publications became ever more comprehensive and developed into a global, encompassing project as is reflected in the increasing number of foreign authors. Whereas the first two handbooks were published mainly in German, \"Vinken & Bruyn\" was eventually published entirely in English, indicating the general changes in the scientific language of neurology after World War II. Distinctions include the uniformity of the series, manner of editorial involvement, thematic comprehensiveness, inclusion of volume editors in \"Vinken & Bruyn,\" and the provision of index volumes. The increasing use of authorities in various neurological subspecialties is an important factor by which these handbooks contrast with many compact neurological textbooks that were available at the time. For historiographical purposes, the three neurological handbooks considered here were important sources for the general study of the history of medicine and science and the history of neurology in particular. Moreover, they served as important catalyzers of the emergence of neurology as a new clinical specialty during the first decades of the twentieth century."}, {"Title": "The Arabic Mood and Feelings Questionnaire: psychometrics and validity in a clinical sample.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to provide clinicians in the Arab World with a child and adolescent depression screening tool. Child and parent versions of the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (CMFQ and PMFQ respectively) were translated to Arabic and administered along with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to 30 children and adolescents and with mood disorders and 76 children and adolescents with other psychiatric disorders seeking treatment at a child and adolescent psychiatry clinic. DSM-IV diagnoses were generated through clinical interviews by a psychiatrist blinded to self-reports. Internal consistency for both versions was excellent with moderate inter-informant agreement and good convergent validity with the SDQ emotional symptoms subscales on the child and parent forms. The CMFQ and PMFQ significantly differentiated between currently depressed participants and those with other psychiatric disorders. CMFQ scores were a stronger predictor of categorization into depressed and non-depressed groups than the PMFQ. Two modes of cutoffs were calculated with one favoring sensitivity (a score of 26 for the CMFQ and 22 for the PMFQ) and another favoring specificity (a score of 31 for the CMFQ and 28 for the PMFQ)."}, {"Title": "Caffeine overdose resulting in severe rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure.", "Abstract": "Despite the fact that caffeine is the most commonly used stimulant in modern society, cases of caffeine overdose are relatively rare, with fatalities reported from doses of 10 g and higher (Nord J Psychiatry. 2006;60:97-106).

They differ in their clinical presentation and in their time course of major symptoms, which predominantly occurs for MR and ASD during childhood and for SCZ during young adult age. Recent findings with focus on the developmental neurobiology of these disorders emphasize shared mechanisms of common origin. These findings propose a continuum of genetic risk factors impacting on synaptic plasticity with MR causing impairments in global cognitive abilities, ASD in social cognition and SCZ in both global and social cognition.\nWe assess here the historical developments that led to the current disease concepts of the three disorders. We then analyse, based on the functions of genes mutated in two or three of the disorders, selected mechanisms shared in neurodevelopmental pathways and synaptic plasticity.\nThe analysis of the psychopathological constructs supports the existence of three distinct clinical entities but also elaborates important associations. Similarly, there are common mechanisms especially in global and social cognition.\nWe discuss implications from this integrated view on MR, ASD and SCZ for child & adolescent and adult psychiatry in pathophysiology and research perspectives."}, {"Title": "Masters of their Conditions III: Clinical applications of theater anthropology in cultural psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Body learning gives actors basic structures and references that enable them to codify their actions in a script or score.

Furthermore, translational research on neuromodulation will allow us to glean something about the underlying cause of patient's illnesses before figuring out a treatment that addresses the source of the problem. Major depression offers perhaps the best example of the rapid progress being made in understanding the biology of mental illness. Studies on the underlying neurobiology of major depression have typically focused on the description of biological differences between patients and healthy subjects such as alterations of monoaminergic or endocrine systems. Psychotropic drugs work by altering neurochemistry to a large extent in widespread regions of the brain, many of which may be unrelated to depression. We believe that more focused, targeted treatment approaches that modulate specific networks in the brain will prove a more effective approach to help treatment-resistant patients. In other words, whereas existing depression treatments approach this disease as a general brain dysfunction, a more complete and appropriate treatment will arise from thinking of depression as a dysfunction of specific brain networks that mediate mood and reward signals (Berton and Nestler, Nat Rev Neurosci 7 (2):137-151, 2006; Krishnan and Nestler, Nature 455(7215):894-902, 2008).

We recruited 420 patients with a psychiatric illness and explored the care pathways they took to reach to psychiatric services and the delays from the onset of illness to reaching psychiatric care.\nThe majority of patients (33.8%) had direct access to mental health care, whereas the others arrived to a specialist in psychiatry through general hospitals (20.3%), general practitioners (33.0%) or private practitioners (9.8%). The main diagnosis for referral was neurotic disorder (36.6%), followed by affective disorder (35.4%) and psychotic disorder (11.5%). The delay from onset of illness to psychiatric care was greater for patients with psychotic disorders than for those with affective and neurotic disorders. The most frequently prescribed treatments were pharmacotherapy (56%), psychological support (8%), and psychotherapy (7.0%); 15% of the patients received no treatment.\nOur multicenter study shows that although general practitioners and hospital doctors are still the main referral point for mental health care, a greater proportion of patients are first seen in private settings or directly reach mental health centers, compared to previous surveys conducted in Italy.

From Gyula (Julius) Don\u00e1th via Kurt Schneider to ICD-10].", "Abstract": "The conceptual history of \"anancasm\" in psychiatry remains almost unexplored and this article will help to remove this deficit. It was the Budapest-based neuropsychiatrist Gyula Don\u00e1th (1849-1944) who first proposed this Greek-rooted term in 1897 as an international term for compulsive symptoms and as an independent mental illness similar to present-day obsessive compulsive disorders (ICD-10). By suggesting this term Don\u00e1th wanted to extend the concept of compulsion as proposed by his teacher Carl Westphal to other compulsive phenomena, psychomotor impulses and restrictions including echolalia, coprolalia, echokinesis, echopraxia, contemporary maladie des tics (present day Tourette's syndrome) and even intermittent dipsomania (craving for alcohol), paraphilias, sexual fetishes and homosexuality. In 1923 Kurt Schneider used this term for a subgroup of psychopathic personalities, the so-called insecure anancastic psychopaths. His concept was much different to that suggested by Don\u00e1th, with the only thing in common being the compulsory component. Schneider's anancasts suffered from feelings of insecurity and insufficiency and were forced to try to overcompensate by being excessively careful, meticulous and hyper-correct. Based on Schneider's concept anancasm has survived as a name for a subdivision of compulsive personality disorders in ICD-10; however, these rather complex personality defects were not what Don\u00e1th had in mind when he first suggested the term anancasm.

Two cases are presented from an evaluation study in a psychiatric hospital. In both cases, the nurses follow the intervention protocol, but the outcome is different. In the first case, the patient ends up in the seclusion room. In the second case, this does not happen. Analyzing the cases from a care ethics perspective, we conclude that applying the intervention in the right way implies more than following the steps laid down in the protocol. It requires a new way of thinking and acting, resulting in new relationships between nurses and patients. Care ethics theory can help clarify what good care is actually about and keep in mind what is needed to apply the intervention. Thus, care ethics theory can be highly practical and helpful in changing and improving healthcare practice."}, {"Title": "Using autopsy brain tissue to study alcohol-related brain damage in the genomic age.", "Abstract": "The New South Wales Tissue Resource Centre at the University of Sydney, Australia, is one of the few human brain banks dedicated to the study of the effects of chronic alcoholism. The bank was affiliated in 1994 as a member of the National Network of Brain Banks and also focuses on schizophrenia and healthy control tissue. Alcohol abuse is a major problem worldwide, manifesting in such conditions as fetal alcohol syndrome, adolescent binge drinking, alcohol dependency, and alcoholic neurodegeneration. The latter is also referred to as alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD). The study of postmortem brain tissue is ideally suited to determining the effects of long-term alcohol abuse, but it also makes an important contribution to understanding pathogenesis across the spectrum of alcohol misuse disorders and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases. Tissue from the bank has contributed to 330 peer-reviewed journal articles including 120 related to alcohol research. Using the results of these articles, this review chronicles advances in alcohol-related brain research since 2003, the so-called genomic age.

In this study, we aimed at investigating whether the implementation of the reimbursement policy for SGA contributed to increasing the number of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia relatively to the number of patients with a diagnosis of other psychotic disorders in outpatient clinics.\nWe analyzed data from Yearbooks of Mental Health that were published by the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Warsaw, Poland in the years 1989\u20132009 registering the number of patients treated for various mental disorders in public facilities in Poland. Temporal trend analysis of the annual number of patients with a diagnosis of psychotic disorders, who were treated at outpatient clinics, was performed.\nWe found a statistically significant increase in the total number of recorded schizophrenia patients treated at outpatient clinics, as well as in the number of patients treated for the first time at outpatient clinics for schizophrenia. These changes overlap with the implementation of the reimbursement policy for SGA.\nOur results suggest that the restricted reimbursement policy for SGA altered the diagnosing process in Poland. It seems that these alterations may have serious social consequences. Given that a diagnosis of schizophrenia is more stigmatizing than a diagnosis of other psychotic disorders, it might be assumed that schizophrenia over-diagnosing, possibly due to reimbursement reasons, add to the enormous burden associated with stigmatization."}, {"Title": "Enhancing Quality in Psychiatry with Psychiatrists (EQUIPP)--results from a pilot study.", "Abstract": "To pilot a pharmacist-led, patient centered medication management program.\nProspective, single arm trial.\nAcademic geriatric psychiatry outpatient clinic.\nOutpatients at least 65 years old, proxy available if demented, and on two or more psychiatric medications.\nA clinical pharmacist completed a baseline medication review and made evidence-based recommendations that were implemented by the pharmacist after discussion with the physician.

A questionnaire was devised to assess knowledge of VTE symptoms, risk factors, prevention, and treatment in clinical staff working in Mental Health Service for Older Peoples' inpatient units. Forty-nine nurses, 12 consultant psychiatrists, and 11 clinical pharmacists responded. A significant proportion of staff had previous involvement in VTE treatment. Staff had significantly more limited knowledge of pulmonary embolism compared to deep vein thrombosis with areas for improvement in presentation, risk factors, and prevention.

This paper argues that the micro-level perspective can be used to identify the smallest building blocks underlying the onset and course of mental ill-health. Psychopathology may be the result of the continuous dynamic interplay between micro-level moment-to-moment experiences and behavioural patterns over time. Reinforcing loops between momentary states may alter the course of mental health towards either a more or less healthy state. An example with observed data, from a population of individuals with depressive symptoms, supports the validity of a dynamic network model of psychopathology and shows that together and over time, this continuous interplay between momentary states may result in the cluster of symptoms we call major depressive disorder. This approach may help conceptualize the nature of mental disorders, and generate individualized insights useful for diagnosis and treatment in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "A review of systems for psychology and psychiatry: adaptive systems, personality psychopathology five (PSY-5), and the DSM-5.", "Abstract": "We outline a crisis in clinical description, in which atheoretical categorical descriptors, as in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), has turned focus away from the obvious: evolved major adaptive systems. Adaptive systems, at the core of a medical review of systems (ROS), allow models of pathology to be layered over an understanding of systems as they normally function. We argue that clinical psychology and psychiatry would develop more programmatically by incorporating 5 systems evolved for adaptation to the external environment: reality modeling for action, short-term danger detection, long-term cost-benefit projection, resource acquisition, and agenda protection. These systems, although not exhaustive, coincide with great historical issues in psychology, psychopathology, and individual differences. Readers of this journal should be interested in this approach because personality is seen as a relatively stable property of these systems. Thus, an essential starting point in ROS-based clinical description involves personality assessment. But this approach also places demands on scientist-practitioners to integrate across sciences. An ROS promotes theories that are (a) compositional, answering the question: What elements comprise the system?; (b) dynamic, answering: How do the elements and other systems interact?; and (c) developmental: How do systems change over time? The proposed ROS corresponds well with the National Institute of Mental Health's recent research domain criteria (RDoC) approach. We urge that in the RDoC approach, measurement variables should be treated as falsifiable and theory-laden markers, not unfalsifiable criteria. We argue that our proposed ROS promotes integration across sciences, rather than fostering the isolation of sciences allowed by atheoretical observation terms, as in the DSM."}, {"Title": "Role of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and amygdala AMPA receptors in the development and expression of context conditioning and sensitization of startle by prior shock.", "Abstract": "A core symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder is hyper-arousal-manifest in part by increases in the amplitude of the acoustic startle reflex. Gewirtz et al. (Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry 22:625-648, 1998) found that, in rats, persistent shock-induced startle increases were prevented by pre-test electrolytic lesions of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). We used reversible inactivation to determine if similar effects reflect actions on (a) BNST neurons themselves versus fibers-of-passage, (b) the development versus expression of such increases, and (c) associative fear versus non-associative sensitization. Twenty-four hours after the last of three shock sessions, startle was markedly enhanced when rats were tested in a non-shock context. These increases decayed over the course of several days. Decay was unaffected by context exposure, and elevated startle was restored when rats were tested for the first time in the original shock context. Thus, both associative and non-associative components could be measured under different conditions. Pre-test intra-BNST infusions of the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX (3\u00a0\u03bcg/side) blocked the non-associative (as did infusions into the basolateral amygdala) but not the associative component, whereas pre-shock infusions disrupted both. NBQX did not affect baseline startle or shock reactivity. These results indicate that AMPA receptors in or very near to the BNST are critical for the expression and development of non-associative shock-induced startle sensitization, and also for context fear conditioning, but not context fear expression. More generally, they suggest that treatments targeting the BNST may be clinically useful for treating trauma-related hyper-arousal and perhaps for retarding its development."}, {"Title": "Culture as a predictor of resistance to change: a study of competing values in a psychiatric nursing context.", "Abstract": "It is well known that a conservative organizational culture can hinder the implementation of new organizational models.

This paper sets out to detect the feasibility of reform in a psychiatric clinic in a Swedish hospital prior to implementation of a new working method - a structured tool based on the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health. A survey consisting of two instruments - an organizational values questionnaire (OVQ) and a resistance to change scale (RTC) - was distributed to registered and assistant nurses at the clinic. The association between the organizational subcultures and resistance to change was investigated with regression analysis. The results revealed that the dominating cultures in the outpatient centers and hospital wards were characterized by human relation properties such as flexibility, cohesion, belongingness, and trust. The mean resistance to change was low, but the subscale of cognitive rigidity was dominant, reflecting a tendency to avoid alternative ideas and perspectives.

In this review, we summarize its physiopathogenetic mechanism, its clinical manifestations in men and women, and the way to manage it.\nProlactin is a hormone secreted by lactotroph cells in the anterior pituitary. Its synthesis and release are under the control of peptides, steroids and neurotransmitters. The main inhibitory regulation is made by dopamine, which binds dopamine receptors D2 on the membrane of lactotroph cells. Antipsychotic-drugs block these receptors and thus remove the inhibitory effect of dopamine on prolactin secretion. All antipsychotic-drugs block D2 receptors and all can induce hyperprolactinemia. Nonetheless, it seems that the faster the antipsychotic-drug dissociates from D2 receptors, the lesser the increase of prolactin in the plasma. Another way to explain hyperprolactinemia is the ability of antipsychotic-drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier. The role of their metabolites should also be considered. For these reasons, one can distinguish prolactin-raising (conventional neuroleptics, amisulpride, risperidone) and prolactin-sparing (clozapine, aripiprazole, olanzapine) antipsychotics. An English study showed that 18% of men and 47% of women treated with antipsychotics for severe mental illness had a prolactin level above the normal range. Hyperprolactinemia is in fact more frequent in women than in men. Sometimes it is asymptomatic, but the higher the prolactin level is, the more patients have clinical manifestations. Some symptoms are due to the hypogonadism caused by prolactin, which disturbs hypothalamic-pituitary axis function, and others are due to direct effects on target tissues. Consequently, patients can suffer from sexual dysfunction, infertility, amenorrhea, gynecomastia or galactorrhoea. Data suggest that these symptoms are common, but patients don't mention them spontaneously and clinicians underestimate their prevalence. In the long-term, hypogonadism involves a premature bone loss in men and women. Klibanski and colleagues showed that this loss is significant only in women with hyperprolactinemia associated with amenorrhea. That suggests that prolactin is not directly responsible for this clinical feature. Nevertheless, prolactin seems to be involved in the development of breast cancer, but its role is unclear for prostate cancer.\nOur review promotes a check-up before beginning a treatment with antipsychotic agents. First, a baseline prolactin level should be measured. It should also include the research on previous treatment with antipsychotic-drugs and the assessment of adverse effects suggestive of hyperprolactinemia. Questioning should finally look for any contra-indication to antipsychotics. Monitoring during antipsychotic treatment has been studied by a group of international experts in psychiatry, medicine, toxicology and pharmacy who made a critical review of clinical guidance on hyperprolactinemia. Experts notify that it is important to check whether patients have any sexual dysfunction, such as loss of libido or menstrual irregularity, and galactorrhoea. Prolactin level should also be controlled after three months of stable dose treatment, or if any clinical feature of hyperprolactinemia appears. If a patient prescribed antipsychotic-drugs has a confirmed prolactin level above the normal range, it is necessary to exclude other causes of hyperprolactinemia. If antipsychotics are really involved, the management should be adapted with the prolactin level and the patient him/herself. To summarize, clinicians can decrease the dose of the antipsychotic or switch to a prolactin-sparing drug. Oral contraceptives can be added whether to prevent pregnancy or to prevent bone loss and osteoporosis. Finally, experts recommend reserving dopamine agonists to treat antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia in very exceptional circumstances as it can worsen the mental illness."}, {"Title": "Theory of mind and the social brain: implications for understanding the genetic basis of schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies in schizophrenia have recently made significant progress in our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of this disorder. Many genetic loci have been identified and now require functional investigation. One approach involves studying their correlation with neuroimaging and neurocognitive endophenotypes. Theory of Mind (ToM) deficits are well established in schizophrenia and they appear to fulfill criteria for being considered an endophenotype. We aim to review the behavioral and neuroimaging-based studies of ToM in schizophrenia, assess its suitability as an endophenotype, discuss current findings, and propose future research directions. Suitable research articles were sourced from a comprehensive literature search and from references identified through other studies. ToM deficits are repeatable, stable, and heritable: First-episode patients, those in remission and unaffected relatives all show deficits. Activation and structural differences in brain regions believed important for ToM are also consistently reported in schizophrenia patients at all stages of illness, although no research to date has examined unaffected relatives. Studies using ToM as an endophenotype are providing interesting genetic associations with both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and specific copy number variations (CNVs) such as the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. We conclude that ToM is an important cognitive endophenotype for consideration in future studies addressing the complex genetic architecture of schizophrenia, and may help identify more homogeneous clinical sub-types for further study."}, {"Title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorder in a developing country.", "Abstract": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders (ATPDs) are relatively under-researched.

During the evaluation of the psychological state of patients with conversion disorder, it could be useful to keep in mind the probability of them having alexithymia to determine the type of suitable therapy."}, {"Title": "Automated MRI parcellation of the frontal lobe.", "Abstract": "Examination of associations between specific disorders and physical properties of functionally relevant frontal lobe sub-regions is a fundamental goal in neuropsychiatry. Here, we present and evaluate automated methods of frontal lobe parcellation with the programs FreeSurfer(FS) and TOADS-CRUISE(T-C), based on the manual method described in Ranta et al. [2009]: Psychiatry Res 172:147-154 in which sulcal-gyral landmarks were used to manually delimit functionally relevant regions within the frontal lobe: i.e., primary motor cortex, anterior cingulate, deep white matter, premotor cortex regions (supplementary motor complex, frontal eye field, and lateral premotor cortex) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions (medial PFC, dorsolateral PFC, inferior PFC, lateral orbitofrontal cortex [OFC] and medial OFC). Dice's coefficient, a measure of overlap, and percent volume difference were used to measure the reliability between manual and automated delineations for each frontal lobe region. For FS, mean Dice's coefficient for all regions was 0.75 and percent volume difference was 21.2%. For T-C the mean Dice's coefficient was 0.77 and the mean percent volume difference for all regions was 20.2%. These results, along with a high degree of agreement between the two automated methods (mean Dice's coefficient = 0.81, percent volume difference = 12.4%) and a proof-of-principle group difference analysis that highlights the consistency and sensitivity of the automated methods, indicate that the automated methods are valid techniques for parcellation of the frontal lobe into functionally relevant sub-regions. Thus, the methodology has the potential to increase efficiency, statistical power and reproducibility for population analyses of neuropsychiatric disorders with hypothesized frontal lobe contributions."}, {"Title": "Suicide in the old elderly: results from one Italian county.", "Abstract": "To investigate factors differentiating old-old elderly (those aged 75 years and older) who died by suicide from middle-aged (those aged 50-64 years) and young-old (aged 65-74 years) adults who took their own lives, and from living psychiatric outpatients 75 years and older who had no suicidal behaviors in the last 12 months before assessment.\nCases for psychological autopsy interviews were 117 old-old elderly who died by suicide between 1994 and 2009.

Information for suicide decedents was gathered through proxy-based interviews, and data regarding living comparison subjects were extracted from medical records.\nA high number of old-old elderly were widowed and lived alone before death; widowhood was more prevalent in the old-old elderly than in the younger suicide groups and the psychiatric outpatients. In addition, old-old elderly were more frequently characterized by the presence of life stressors in the few months before death compared with the psychiatric outpatients.\nClinicians involved in the prevention of suicide in older adults should pay particular attention to loneliness and lack of social support, two conditions that may push the individual to feel hopeless, especially in those individuals who are facing stressful life events."}, {"Title": "Cortical changes associated with depression and antidepressant use in Alzheimer and Lewy body dementia: an MRI surface-based morphometric study.", "Abstract": "Depression is common in dementia, especially in the early stages, with important clinical implications, but the etiology is unknown and most likely heterogeneous. Antidepressant use in the elderly without dementia has previously been shown to be associated with high risks of adverse events and with structural brain alterations.\nTo investigate cortical changes associated with depression and antidepressant use in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD).\n74 subjects with mild AD and LBD from geriatric and psychiatry outpatient clinics in Western Norway were included. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to assess depression. Automatic preprocessing using Freesurfer included steps for white and grey matter surface reconstruction. The resulting cortical thickness was analyzed using linear modeling.\nClusters of depression-associated thinning were found in prefrontal and temporal areas. Treatment-associated thinning was observed in the parahippocampal region and was significant even after correction for age, sex, AD/LBD diagnosis, and MADRS scores.\nDepression in mild AD and LBD is associated with cortical thinning in prefrontal and temporal areas. The findings suggest that depressive symptoms in mild dementia could develop due to neurodegeneration in the same neural circuits that are critical for depression across different brain disorders. Antidepressant use in patients with mild AD and LBD is associated with parahippocampal thinning. Taken together with low efficacy of antidepressants in cognitively impaired patients and high risks of adverse events, our results suggest a need to re-evaluate the treatment approaches for depression and the role of antidepressants in patients with dementia."}, {"Title": "More equal societies have less mental illness: what should therapists do on Monday morning?", "Abstract": "Therapists seeing poor clients may ask if countries with greater income equality have less mental illness.

Thirty-three IMHP were recruited from outpatient and day clinics at the psychiatry department of a university hospital within a 5-month time period for this qualitative, descriptive study. Data were gathered using a structured interview form with open-ended questions to explore the changes in everyday life experienced by IMHP during the course of their illness. Data were analysed using the Colaizzi method of analysis. Our findings show that almost all IMHP were concerned about being stigmatized by others, society, their family, and health care professionals. Another concern that IMHP reported was self-stigmatization. Stigmatization serves as a barrier to treatment adherence and socialization in IMHP. Furthermore, stigmatization has a significant impact on the lives of IMHP, and methods of coping with stigmatization are commonly ineffective. However, stigmatization can be reduced by dealing with the illness, IMHP, their relatives, and professionals in an unprejudiced manner."}, {"Title": "Pattern of suicides in 2009: data from the National Suicide Registry Malaysia.", "Abstract": "The National Suicide Registry Malaysia (NSRM) is a nationwide system that captures data on completed suicides in Malaysia from all forensic departments under the purview of the Ministry of Health Malaysia.\nThis paper examines all suicidal deaths reported to the NSRM from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009.

These potentials are far from being realized because of a number of technical, conceptual, financial, and bioinformatics issues. Mass spectrometry provides analytical platforms that address the technical barriers to success in metabolomics research; however, the limited commercial availability of analytical and stable isotope standards has created a bottleneck for the absolute quantitation of a number of metabolites. Conceptual and financial factors contribute to the generation of statistically under-powered clinical studies, whereas bioinformatics issues result in the publication of a large number of unidentified metabolites. The path forward in this field involves targeted metabolomics analyses of large control and patient populations to define both the normal range of a defined metabolite and the potential heterogeneity (eg, bimodal) in complex patient populations. This approach requires that metabolomics research groups, in addition to developing a number of analytical platforms, build sufficient chemistry resources to supply the analytical standards required for absolute metabolite quantitation.

The goal was to assess clients' cultural connection to their racial identity and to understand what impact their American Indian identity had on their mental health care experiences. A modified Consensual Qualitative Research (CQR) method was used to develop the interview protocol and code responses. Interview data revealed that clients primarily based their racial identity on family stories of an American Indian ancestor and the majority did not feel their identification as American Indian was relevant to their mental health care.

Unlike cognitive therapies, it does not involve cognitive functioning and may increase psychotherapies' efficiency.\nIn the absence of data in the scientific literature (Medline and Web of Science), we propose a synthesis of theoretical data from social psychology with a reflection on its applications in the daily practice of psychiatry.\nFirstly we present auto-manipulation: the \"chilling effect\" is the fact that people tend to keep to a decision and to duplicate it, even if it does not work. The commitment of the patient, i.e., the degree to which he/she identifies with his/her act, will be even stronger if the patient's sense of freedom is high. The rationalization process is the ability for individuals to revisit their beliefs after being forced to issue a behavior (that he/she did not adhere to) to justify it a posteriori. In the second part, we present techniques for hetero-manipulation. Priming is to ask about a low effort to \"initiate\" the behavior. The lure technique is to hide convenience or invent fictitious benefits of a product, but is not ethical. The labeling technique is to assign an individual to a positive value regardless of his or her behavior, which increases the probability of emission of positive behaviors. The touch technique, whatever the cultural context, encourages a patient to have more confidence in his/her therapist and to make them friendly towards the person involved by creating a positive mood, reduces stress in patients before surgery, and improve the academic performance of students.\nWe propose reflections on the application of these concepts in daily practice in the psychiatric interview.

Its legal regulations do not only differ between European countries, but also on a federal level. Only few studies so far dealt with rates of involuntary admission (RIA), mainly focusing on adults, rather than children and adolescents. None of the studies analyzed this topic in a large cohort. The aim of this regional cross-sectional study was to compare voluntary and involuntary admissions in child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) regarding personal and admission characteristics. Furthermore, risk factors and predictors of involuntary admission should be identified. A retrospective analysis of hospital admission registers from three major German CAP hospitals over a period of 6 years (2004-2009) was conducted (N = 10,547 inpatients). Group comparisons between involuntarily and voluntarily treated minors and a logistic regression to determine predictors of legal status were performed. Information on harm to self or others prior to the admission, medication and clinical outcome was not available due to data structure. 70.8 % of patients were voluntarily and 29.2 % involuntarily admitted. Both subsamples comprised more males. The RIA decreased consistently over the years, ranging from 25.7 to 32.4 %. The strongest predictor of being admitted involuntarily was suffering from mental retardation (OR = 15.74). Adolescence, substance abuse, psychotic disorders and admission on duty time were also strongly associated (OR > 3). In this first large cohort study on involuntary treatment of children and adolescents in Germany, about every fourth patient was treated involuntarily. Certain personal and disease-related factors increased the risk. Commitment laws and other legal instruments for regulating involuntary placements are inconsistent and a standardized description or systematic analysis is needed.

That form contained questions about the incidence and acceptance of joint crisis plans and psychiatric advance directives and previous experiences with them. 108 medical directors of psychiatric hospitals and departments responded (response rate: 22.8%). Their answers demonstrate that in their hospitals these documents are rarely used. Among the respondents, joint crisis plans are more accepted than psychiatric advance directives. There is a certain uncertainty when dealing with these instruments. Our main conclusion is that German psychiatry needs an intensified discussion on the use of instruments for patients to constitute procedures for future critical psychiatric events. For this purpose it will be helpful to collect more empirical data. Furthermore, the proposal of joint crisis plans in psychiatric hospitals and departments should be discussed as well as the possibility of consulting an expert during the preparation of a psychiatric advance directive."}, {"Title": "The professional competence profile of Finnish nurses practising in a forensic setting.", "Abstract": "Forensic nurses in Finland work in the two state-maintained forensic hospitals. The main function of these hospitals is to perform forensic psychiatric evaluation and provide treatment for two groups of patients: violent offenders found not guilty by reason of insanity, and those too dangerous or difficult to be treated in regional hospitals. Although the forensic nurses work with the most challenging psychiatric patients, they do not have any preparatory special education for the work. This paper describes the development of nurses who participated in a 1-year further education programme that was tailored to them. The nurses experienced that the 1-year education had a significant impact on their overall competence level. They found that their skills for observing, helping, teaching and caring for their patients had increased during the education. Conversely, it was found that the nurses collaborated little with their patients' family members. They were also not familiar with utilizing research findings in improving their care of patients. Forensic nursing is a global and relatively young profession that combines nursing care and juridical processes. There are, however, significant differences in the qualifications of forensic nurses internationally. The aim of the study was to describe the professional competence profile of practising forensic nurses in Finland and to explore the effects of a 1-year further education programme on that competence profile. The data were collected in 2011-2012 using the Nurse Competence Scale comprising seven competence categories, and analysed using the software package SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc., Armonk, NY, USA). The participants were 19 forensic nurses and their 15 head nurses. The assessed overall scores from both informant groups indicated a high level of competence across the seven categories. The nurses felt that the overall competence level had increased during the education programme. The increase seen by the head nurses was smaller.

Prevention of neuropsychiatric illnesses as compared to other illnesses is particularly important as they run a chronic course and cause substantial disability. Preventive measures have been found to be effective in reducing incidence and disability in a wide range of mental illnesses such as depression, psychosis, anxiety and conduct disorders. The need of the hour is to translate advances in our understanding of mental illness into effective intervention programmes for the prevention of mental illness and the promotion of positive mental health."}, {"Title": "A 12-week comparison regarding symptom improvement in an urban university-based outpatient child psychiatry clinic.", "Abstract": "To compare the efficacy of pharmacotherapy versus combination pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for externalizing, conduct, and aggressive behaviors in children aged 6 through 18 years in an urban academic outpatient facility.

Literature-based discovery may help to investigate the patterns of multimorbidity and to integrate medical knowledge for improving healthcare delivery for individuals with co-occurring chronic conditions.\nTo explore the usefulness of literature-based discovery in primary care research through the key-case of finding associations between psychiatric and somatic diseases relevant to general practice in a large biomedical literature database (Medline).\nBy using literature based discovery for matching disease profiles as vectors in a high-dimensional associative concept space, co-occurrences of a broad spectrum of chronic medical conditions were matched for their potential in biomedicine. An experimental setting was chosen in parallel with expert evaluations and expert meetings to assess performance and to generate targets for integrating literature-based discovery in multidisciplinary medical research of psychiatric and somatic disease associations.\nThrough stepwise reductions a reference set of 21,945 disease combinations was generated, from which a set of 166 combinations between psychiatric and somatic diseases was selected and assessed by text mining and expert evaluation.\nLiterature-based discovery tools generate specific patterns of associations between psychiatric and somatic diseases: one subset was appraised as promising for further research; the other subset surprised the experts, leading to intricate discussions and further eliciting of frameworks of biomedical knowledge. These frameworks enable us to specify targets for further developing and integrating literature-based discovery in multidisciplinary research of general practice, psychology and psychiatry, and epidemiology."}, {"Title": "The autism brain imaging data exchange: towards a large-scale evaluation of the intrinsic brain architecture in autism.", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a formidable challenge for psychiatry and neuroscience because of their high prevalence, lifelong nature, complexity and substantial heterogeneity. Facing these obstacles requires large-scale multidisciplinary efforts. Although the field of genetics has pioneered data sharing for these reasons, neuroimaging had not kept pace. In response, we introduce the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)-a grassroots consortium aggregating and openly sharing 1112 existing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data sets with corresponding structural MRI and phenotypic information from 539 individuals with ASDs and 573 age-matched typical controls (TCs; 7-64 years) (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/). Here, we present this resource and demonstrate its suitability for advancing knowledge of ASD neurobiology based on analyses of 360 male subjects with ASDs and 403 male age-matched TCs. We focused on whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity and also survey a range of voxel-wise measures of intrinsic functional brain architecture. Whole-brain analyses reconciled seemingly disparate themes of both hypo- and hyperconnectivity in the ASD literature; both were detected, although hypoconnectivity dominated, particularly for corticocortical and interhemispheric functional connectivity. Exploratory analyses using an array of regional metrics of intrinsic brain function converged on common loci of dysfunction in ASDs (mid- and posterior insula and posterior cingulate cortex), and highlighted less commonly explored regions such as the thalamus. The survey of the ABIDE R-fMRI data sets provides unprecedented demonstrations of both replication and novel discovery. By pooling multiple international data sets, ABIDE is expected to accelerate the pace of discovery setting the stage for the next generation of ASD studies."}, {"Title": "The placebo effect in psychiatry: problem or solution?", "Abstract": "This opinion piece aims to situate the placebo effect within the field of psychiatric treatment. To accomplish this, the placebo is explored at the centre of an often heated debate between three discrete perspectives: the clinical trial researcher, the placebo researcher and the clinician. Each occupational perspective has its own vested interests and practical concerns that drive how the placebo concepts are negotiated and applied. It is argued that because the trial and placebo researchers typically represent opposing viewpoints, clinicians are generally uncomfortable or even baffled by placebo concepts, and this three-way tension has crucial implications for the field's progress."}, {"Title": "At the boundary of the self: the insular cortex in patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia, their healthy siblings, and normal volunteers.", "Abstract": "The insular cortex (insula), whose normal function involves delineating the boundary between self and non-self stimuli, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, including hallucinations and delusions. Childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS), that includes the onset of psychosis before age 13, is a severe and continuous form of the illness which shows profound and global progressive cortical brain abnormalities during adolescence which merge in the adult pattern with age. Using prospectively acquired anatomic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, a matched sample of COS patients, their nonpsychotic full siblings and healthy volunteers, we measured insular volume using the FreeSurfer automated software. COS patients (n=98; 234 scans) had significantly lower right (p=0.003), left (p<0.001), and total (p<0.001) insular volumes than healthy volunteers (n=100; 248 scans). Right insular volume negatively correlated with positive symptoms as measured by the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) (p=0.02), while both left (p=0.01) and right (p=0.006) insula volumes were positively correlated with overall functioning, as measured by the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) scores. COS siblings (n=71; 153 scans), on the other hand, did not differ significantly from normal volunteers suggesting that the insular deficits are more related to the illness state than a familial endophenotype. These results also highlight the salience of the insula in positive symptoms of schizophrenia perhaps resulting from the inability to discriminate between self from the non-self in COS. Further work to connect insular deficits to other neurocircuitries is warranted."}, {"Title": "Patient satisfaction with psychotropic drugs: Validation of the PAtient SAtisfaction with Psychotropic (PASAP) scale in patients with bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "The PAtient SAtisfaction with Psychotropic (PASAP) scale is a self-completed questionnaire measuring satisfaction with psychotropic medication. The aim of the study was to describe its development in French and its psychometric properties.\nScale construction was based on an extensive search of the literature. The item reduction process required semi-structured interviews of psychiatric outpatients (n=30). The final version of the PASAP is a 9-item, 5-point Likert-type scale, covering the scope of effectiveness and adherence. To assess the psychometric properties of the scale, French patients with an acute manic episode (n=314) from a large European observational cohort completed the PASAP scale 3 months after psychotropic treatment initiation/change. Internal validity and reliability were assessed using principal component analysis (PCA). Concurrent validity was assessed using comparisons to physician-rated satisfaction with life, illness severity, mood relapse, compliance and side effects.\nParticipation rate was 68.4%. PCA was in favour of uni-dimensionality. Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient was 0.85 (95%CI 0.83-0.88).

Different methods of analyzing the electroencephalogram (EEG) changes during ECT have been studied for predicting clinical outcome. Analysis of the fractal dimension (FD) is one such method. Mid-seizure and post-seizure FD has been shown to correlate with antidepressant effect. In this study, we examined whether the highest fractal dimension achieved during each ECT session changed over the course of 6 ECTs. The sample for this study came from a randomized controlled trial, comparing the efficacy of bifrontal and bitemporal electrode placements in schizophrenia. EEG was recorded using bilateral frontal pole leads during all ECT sessions. In 40 of the 114 randomized patients, we could obtain artifact-free EEGs for the first 6 ECT sessions. FD was calculated using standardized algorithms. For each session, the average of 5 highest FDs was calculated. The change in this value over a course of 6 ECTs was analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. The average highest FD remained virtually unchanged across the 6 ECT sessions. Means (standard deviations) average maximum FDs over the 6 sessions were 1.57 (0.075), 1.57 (0.064), 1.56 (0.064), 1.57 (0.062), 1.55 (0.07), and 1.56 (0.067); occasion effect, F = 0.5, P = .75. Group effect (F = 0.01, P = .92) and group \u00d7 occasion interaction effect (F = 1.88, P = .1) were not significant, suggesting no influence of electrode placement on maximum FD. Seizure duration, however, showed significant decline over the course of ECT. Maximum FD of ECT-induced EEG seizure remains fairly constant over frontal poles across the first 6 ECT sessions, which is true irrespective of ECT electrode placements."}, {"Title": "The impact of the Danish Medico-Legal Council on the choice between treatment and punishment for non-psychotic offenders.", "Abstract": "The Danish Medico-Legal Council provides the court with statements based on available psychiatric assessment reports to assist the law in the use of the Penal Code sections on mentally disordered offenders.\nTo analyse the impact of the Council on the courts' choice between punishment and treatment in cases of offenders falling under \u00a769 of the Penal Code, i.e. mentally disordered, although not psychotic offenders.\nIn 298 cases of defendants who according to the Medico-Legal Council might fall under \u00a769 the recommendations of the assessment reports, the recommendations of the Council and the final verdicts are compared; and assessment reports from forensic psychiatric centres are compared with those from other psychiatrists.\nThe recommendations of the Medico-Legal Council were often, but not blindly followed by the courts. The probability for the Council to recommend some measure of treatment was about 50% for adult males, and higher for adolescents and for females. In court, however, the two genders as well as adolescents and adults alike all had the same probability, approximately 50%, of being sentenced with treatment instead of punishment. When measured by the final verdict, the Medico-Legal Council is of higher quality than the assessment reports, especially those from outside forensic psychiatry.\nThe Council serves as a quality assurance of Danish forensic psychiatric assessments, and the Council's statements are by the court considered to represent the state of the art of these assessments."}, {"Title": "Understanding psychopathology in migrants: a mixed categorical-dimensional approach.", "Abstract": "Literature on mental disorders in migrants is constantly increasing.

The psychopathological assessment was conducted with the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry (AMDP) and clinical diagnoses were formulated according to ICD-10. We proceeded through a two-step analysis: (1) comparing the prevalence rates of psychopathological symptoms across diagnoses; then (2) conducting a factor analysis to assess how those symptoms configure psychopathological dimensions and how these dimensions underlie clinical diagnoses.\nAs expected, we found significant associations between diagnoses and the prevalence of their core psychopathological symptoms. Factor analysis revealed a strong polymorphism of the psychopathological presentation of mental disorders and unexpectedly showed that in each diagnostic cluster, the first extracted factor was not composed of core symptoms.\nA mixed categorical-dimensional approach seems to improve the description of the psychopathology among migrants, as it adds relevant information regarding psychopathological dimensions useful to the understanding of the peculiar clinical expressivity of our patients."}, {"Title": "[The collective modes of ordering of the voice-hearing experience].", "Abstract": "The article examines how voice-hearing as an (in)direct experience can become a subject of ethnographic observation.\nAn ethnographic participant observation was conducted over a five-month period of time in two \"Trialogue\" self-help groups organized by the \"Netzwerk Stimmenh\u00f6ren\", an NGO based in Berlin, Germany.

'Stop smoking' services should be tailored to the needs of individual patient groups. It is important therefore to investigate factors relevant to different groups in order to inform future quit smoking interventions. We compared 50 patients and 50 staff in a secure mental health hospital on measures of smoking and smoking motives, nicotine dependence, craving, previous cessation attempts, motivation to quit and quit smoking-related self-efficacy. Patients were significantly more dependent on nicotine with higher levels of craving; were more likely to smoke to cope with stress, for something to do when bored, for enjoyment and pleasure; and reported significantly less readiness to quit smoking. Staff were more likely to cite health concerns as reasons for quitting. Future pre-intervention work with inpatients should focus on increasing their readiness to quit smoking. Once motivation is increased, interventions should include advice on reducing cravings, finding alternative methods for coping with stress and boredom and achieving enjoyment and pleasure from alternative sources."}, {"Title": "Deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorders: long-term analysis of quality of life.", "Abstract": "To evaluate the long-term effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on quality of life (QOL) in therapy-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients.\n16 patients who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed) (DSM-IV) criteria for OCD and were considered therapy-refractory were treated with DBS.

The objective of this study was to compare the relation of insight in patients with psychotic illness to that of psychopathology and frontal lobe function.\nForty patients with psychotic disorder were selected from those attending the Department of Psychiatry in a tertiary care teaching hospital. The evaluation of insight was carried out using the Schedule for Assessment of Insight (SAI), that of frontal lobe function by the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and psychopathology by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). The correlation coefficients were determined.\nA negative correlation between SAI and BPRS scores means that the BPRS score is opposite to SAI scores. When the SAI total score was compared with the FAB total score, the correlation coefficient demonstrated a positive correlation. Better insight predicted lesser psychopathology and also that poor insight would exist with greater psychopathology. Better insight predicted a higher functional status of frontal lobes and prefrontal cortex in particular.\nInsight deficits in schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses are multidimensional. Integration of different aetiological factors like biological, psychopathological, environmental ones and others are necessary for a better understanding of insight in psychosis."}, {"Title": "Use of narratives to assess language disorders in an inpatient pediatric psychiatric population.", "Abstract": "A large proportion of child psychiatry patients have undiagnosed language disorders.

Results showed that (1) more than twice as many children were identified with language impairment when both narrative and core language assessment were used, and (2) core language comprehension and complex verbal working memory were the strongest predictors of narrative production, while core language comprehension, a less complex working-memory task, and social skills best predicted narrative comprehension.

The lifetime prevalence of major depression approaches 20%, yet current treatments are often inadequate both because of associated side effects and because they are ineffective for many people. In basic research, animal models are often used to study depression. Typically, experimental animals are exposed to acute or chronic stress to generate a variety of depression-like symptoms. Despite its clinical importance, very little is known about the cellular and neural circuits that mediate these symptoms. Recent advances in circuit-targeted approaches have provided new opportunities to study the neuropathology of mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. We review recent progress and highlight some studies that have begun tracing a functional neuronal circuit diagram that may prove essential in establishing novel treatment strategies in mood disorders. First, we shed light on the complexity of mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) responses to stress by discussing two recent studies reporting that optogenetic activation of midbrain DA neurons can induce or reverse depression-related behaviors. Second, we describe the role of the lateral habenula circuitry in the pathophysiology of depression.

Incidents of sexual behaviour were common, with 13% of patients responsible for at least one incident. Although exposure was the most frequent of these behaviours, non-consensual sexual touching, was instigated by 1 in 20 patients. There were no differences in the numbers of sexual events between single sex and mixed gender wards. Few associations were found with the demographic features of perpetrators, although all those engaging in public masturbation were male, and male patients were more likely to sexually touch another without their consent. Single sex wards do not seem to necessarily offer significant protection to potentially vulnerable victims.

In this paper, I ask: 'How informed are the 'informers' in clinical practice?' Physicians have a duty to be 'well-informed': patient well-being depends not just in conveying adequate information to patients, it also depends on physicians keeping up-to-date about: (1) popular misunderstandings of illnesses and treatments; and (2) the importance of patient psychology in affecting prognosis. Taking the case of depression as an entry point, this paper argues that medical researchers and physicians need to pay serious attention to the explanations given to patients regarding their diagnosis. Studies on lay understanding of depression show that there is a common belief that depression is wholly caused by a 'chemical imbalance' (such as 'low serotonin') that can be restored by chemically restorative antidepresssants, a claim that has entered 'folk wisdom'. However, these beliefs oversimplify and misrepresent the current scientific understanding of the causes of depression: first, there is consensus in the scientific community that the causes of depression include social as well as psychological triggers (and not just biochemical ones); second, there is significant dissensus in the scientific community over exactly what lower level, biological or biochemical processes are involved in causing depression; third, there is no established consensus about how antidepressants work at a biochemical level; fourth, there is evidence that patients are negatively affected if they believe their depression is wholly explained by (the vague descriptor) of 'biochemical imbalance'. I argue that the medical community has a duty, to provide patients with adequate information and to be aware of the negative health impact of prevalent oversimplifications-whatever their origins."}, {"Title": "Psychometric properties and validation of the Satisfaction with Life Scale in psychiatric and medical outpatients in Malaysia.", "Abstract": "The present study evaluated the psychometric properties and factor structure of the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) in a sample of clinical outpatients in Malaysia.

Data regarding use of oral (OR) and transdermal (TDR) rivastigmine, compliance (degree of adherence), and caregiver satisfaction with treatment were evaluated.\nIn total, 2252 patients with a mean age of 77.2 years were included; 60.2% were women. AD was moderate to moderately severe in 58.4%. Rivastigmine treatment was started orally in 54.4% of the patients and transdermally in 45.6%; 35.6% of those who started treatment by the OR route switched to TDR. A single dose adjustment was sufficient for 77.5% of patients on TDR treatment vs 11.8% of patients receiving OR treatment. More patients on TDR treatment (80.8% vs. 57.1% on OR treatment) reached the maximum therapeutic dose of rivastigmine and did so in a shorter period of time (51.6 vs 205.8 days). Compliance rates (60.5% vs 47.2%) and caregivers' satisfaction with treatment (89.4% vs 81.9%) were also higher for TDR.\nIn normal clinical practice, using the TDR route of administration improves dose titration and drug compliance, allowing more patients to reach the maximum recommended dose of rivastigmine in a shorter time period."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry with open doors. Part 2: Therapeutic challenges].", "Abstract": "In the previous part of the issue we argued that opening the doors of acute psychiatric inpatient wards is actually one of the anchor points on the way to an innovative psychiatry. It focuses on the patient's personality in a sense that this is taken as seriously as the psychiatric disorder itself. Patients and relatives should be enabled to participate in treatment decisions as they should experience that treatment teams are concerned about reliance, liability and security in therapeutic relationships in an empathetic way. The second part of the issue contributes to the therapeutic measures, the different skills and modifications of treatment frameworks in acute psychiatry (e.g. prevention of crowding in acute psychiatric inpatient units, education of staff, assessment of the risks of violence, de-escalation strategies and coping with suicidality). They might be helpful in implementing the outlined confidence about the essence of therapeutic relationships, autonomy and codetermination of patients in treatment. These suggestions might enhance a professional approach particularly with respect to prevention and also concerning acute interventions in situations of endangerment to self and others and of aggression and violence in the units. In this way they help to achieve the goal of open doors in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Application of functional near-infrared spectroscopy in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Two decades ago, the introduction of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) into the field of neuroscience created new opportunities for investigating neural processes within the human cerebral cortex. Since then, fNIRS has been increasingly used to conduct functional activation studies in different neuropsychiatric disorders, most prominently schizophrenic illnesses, affective disorders and developmental syndromes, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder as well as normal and pathological aging. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of state of the art fNIRS research in psychiatry covering a wide range of applications, including studies on the phenomenological characterization of psychiatric disorders, descriptions of life-time developmental aspects, treatment effects, and genetic influences on neuroimaging data. Finally, methodological shortcomings as well as current research perspectives and promising future applications of fNIRS in psychiatry are discussed. We conclude that fNIRS is a valid addition to the range of neuroscientific methods available to assess neural mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders. Future research should particularly focus on expanding the presently used activation paradigms and cortical regions of interest, while additionally fostering technical and methodological advances particularly concerning the identification and removal of extracranial influences on fNIRS data as well as systematic artifact correction. Eventually, fNIRS might be a useful tool in practical psychiatric settings involving both diagnostics and the complementary treatment of psychological disorders using, for example, neurofeedback applications."}, {"Title": "Discourses of collaborative failure: identity, role and discourse in an interdisciplinary world.", "Abstract": "Discourses of interdisciplinary health-care are becoming more centralised in the context of global healthcare practices, which are increasingly based on multisystem interventions. As with all dominant discourses that are narrated into being, many others have been silenced and decentralised in the process. While questions of the nature and constituents of interdisciplinary practices continue to be debated and rehearsed, this paper focuses on the discourse of interdisciplinary collaboration using psychiatry as an example, with the aim of highlighting competing and alternative discourses. The fundamental premise of this paper is that collaborative relationships form the basis of interdisciplinary practices in psychiatry. Through a critical engagement and a deconstructive reading of the pretext, context and subtexts of interdisciplinarity, we interrogate the concept of interdisciplinary practice within psychiatry. We contend that an important part of understanding and further conceptualising the discourse is through fracturing it. This process is illustrated in the successive stages of our conceptual map of discourse development: establishing, maintaining and developing discourses. An understanding of interdisciplinary practice is not only critical for psychiatry, but also offers important insights into the performance of collaborative failures and indeed successes across nursing and allied health professions."}, {"Title": "Home-based mental health services for older adults: a review of ten model programs.", "Abstract": "The objective is to provide information on successful programs providing home-based services to mentally ill elderly in order to assist other communities wishing to establish such programs.\nThe ten programs described in this article were selected by peer review from applications for an award given by the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry and were participants in an invitational conference.\nEight of the programs were components of a community agency and two were components of a medical school department of psychiatry. Six of the programs focused primarily on individuals with anxiety and depression and utilized a range of individual psychotherapies. The other four accepted patients with any psychiatric diagnosis including dementia and included medication management as part of their services. The numbers served by the ten programs ranged from about 50 to 300 new cases per year, and the staffing ranged from 2 to 13 often with a combination of full and part time. The annual budget for the ten programs ranged from $30,000 to $1,250,000. Budget sources usually included some combination of public funds, philanthropy, and fee-for-service income.\nDespite the logistic and fiscal challenges of providing home-based services to mentally ill older adults there are many long-standing successful programs that can serve as models for communities wishing to establish similar programs.

The current welfare reforms are endangering the welfare and livelihood of the most disadvantaged of our patients. These reforms in the authors' opinion are related more to the historical cycle of societal attitude to homeless people than to seeing them as the undeserving poor. This is particularly true since the current economic crisis was not caused by the poor, so it is very unfair that our poorest patients should suffer most as a result of the welfare reforms."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry with open doors. Part 1: Rational for an open door for acute psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Despite the reform efforts of the last decades modern acute psychiatry still stands between conflicting priorities in everyday practice. The protection of patient autonomy might conflict with a regulatory mandate of psychiatry in societal contexts and the necessity of coercive measures and involuntary treatment might become problematic with respect to presumed but contentious interests of the patient. The conflicts particularly concern questions of involuntary commitment, door closing, coercive and isolation measures. Research on the topic of therapeutic effectiveness of these practices is rare. Accordingly, the practice depends on the federal state, hospital and ward and is very heterogeneous. Epidemiological prognosis predicts an increase of psychiatric disorders; however, simultaneously in terms of medical ethics the warranty of patient autonomy, shared decision-making and informed consent in psychiatry become increasingly more important. This challenges structural and practical changes in psychiatry, particularly in situations of self and third party endangerment which are outlined and a rationale for an opening of the doors in acute psychiatric wards is provided."}, {"Title": "Work-related psychopathology: rates in different work activities and relationship between subjective perception of work distress and psychiatric disturbances.", "Abstract": "The link between work distress and negative mental health outcome is an emergent topic in the scientific literature.

Persons suffering from mental ill-health are a vulnerable group, and loneliness influences the perception of physical, social, and emotional well-being. However, there are few studies exploring lived experiences of loneliness among people with mental ill-health. This qualitative study aimed to illuminate experiences of loneliness among people with mental ill-health. Five individual, informal conversational interviews were performed and subjected to qualitative content analysis. The main findings showed that experiences of loneliness could be metaphorically described as looking at the world through a frosted window. The experiences of loneliness were multifaceted and altering as well as emotionally and socially excluding. The findings are discussed in relation to Tillich dimensions of loneliness: loneliness as a painful dimension of being alone, and solitude as the enriching dimension of being alone. People suffering from mental ill-health carry a twofolded stigma. They feel socially undesirable because of their mental ill-health, and the social perceptions of lonely people are generally unfavourable. We believe that mental health nurses can support the developing and creative dimension of loneliness through a confirming approach, where people with mental ill-health feel seen, heard, and respected as human beings."}, {"Title": "The value of 'positive' clinical signs for weakness, sensory and gait disorders in conversion disorder: a systematic and narrative review.", "Abstract": "Experts in the field of conversion disorder have suggested for the upcoming DSM-V edition to put less weight on the associated psychological factors and to emphasise the role of clinical findings. Indeed, a critical step in reaching a diagnosis of conversion disorder is careful bedside neurological examination, aimed at excluding organic signs and identifying 'positive' signs suggestive of a functional disorder. These positive signs are well known to all trained neurologists but their validity is still not established. The aim of this study is to provide current evidence regarding their sensitivity and specificity. We conducted a systematic search on motor, sensory and gait functional signs in Embase, Medline, PsycINfo from 1965 to June 2012. Studies in English, German or French reporting objective data on more than 10 participants in a controlled design were included in a systematic review. Other relevant signs are discussed in a narrative review. Eleven controlled studies (out of 147 eligible articles) describing 14 signs (7 motor, 5 sensory, 2 gait) reported low sensitivity of 8-100% but high specificity of 92-100%. Studies were evidence class III, only two had a blinded design and none reported on inter-rater reliability of the signs.

He saw a clear division between these two approaches and considered a number of psychotic symptoms to be fundamentally un-understandable. We here argue for an updating of Jasper's view that includes the possibility, due to advances in neuroscience and neuropsychology, for explanation-aided understanding. We describe two scientific explanatory models for kinds of psychotic symptoms deemed un-understandable by Jaspers that illustrate this process. The first describes how dysfunction of the brain dopamine salience system may produce ideas of reference. The second demonstrates that symptoms of made-actions may be caused by abnormalities in the feed-forward motor control system. Both of these models begin at a biological level describing pathological brain processes in neuroscience language but then utilize neuropsychology to 'translate' from brain dysfunction into the mental. Both models break down the pathological pathways into individual subjective elements (particularly misattributing meaning to environmental stimuli and having body parts moved by others) that are understandable because they are common to nearly all of us. The neuropsychology provides hypotheses about the functional and physiological structures underlying familiar subjective experiences. Analyses of disorders of those structures thus provide a scaffold for expanding our empathic understanding of the subjective experiences of those suffering from psychiatric illness."}, {"Title": "A community engaged curriculum for public service psychiatry fellowship training.", "Abstract": "Transforming the mental health system into a recovery oriented, integrated system of care requires a psychiatric work force that understands the relationship between recovery processes and community living.

Given the rising numbers of civil detentions in The Netherlands and other European countries, it is important to understand the mechanism behind this association. Our aim is to study the links between opinions about prior psychiatric treatment, insight, service engagement and the risk of (new) civil detentions.\nWe took a random sample of 252 from the 2,682 patients consecutively coming into contact with two psychiatric emergency teams in Amsterdam between September 2004 and September 2006. We recorded socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and information about prior involuntary admissions. We interviewed the patients using the Verona Service Satisfaction Scale (Verona-EU), the Birchwood Insight Scale and the Service Engagement Scale. During a two-year follow-up period we noted their use of mental health care facilities.\nPatients with a satisfactory score on the Verona-EU had significantly lower odds for civil detentions during follow-up compared to patients with a dissatisfactory score on this scale (OR = 0.3). Level of insight did not influence the risk of detention during follow-up. Furthermore, of the 131 patients admitted involuntarily the year before, one-third looked back on their involuntary admission with unambiguous satisfaction.\nMore satisfaction with prior treatment seems to reduce the risk of civil detention remarkably. Low levels of satisfaction seem to be mainly dependent on a history of previous involuntary admission. These findings seem to open up a new perspective for diminishing the risk of (new) civil detention by trying to enhance satisfaction with treatment, especially for patients under detention."}, {"Title": "Sexually dimorphic white matter geometry abnormalities in adolescent onset schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The normal human brain is characterized by a pattern of gross anatomical asymmetry. This pattern, known as the \"torque\", is associated with a sexual dimorphism: The male brain tends to be more asymmetric than that of the female. This fact, along with well-known sex differences in brain development (faster in females) and onset of psychosis (earlier with worse outcome in males), has led to the theory that schizophrenia is a disorder in which sex-dependent abnormalities in the development of brain torque, the correlate of the capacity for language, cause alterations in interhemispheric connectivity, which are causally related to psychosis (Crow TJ, Paez P, Chance SE. 2007. Callosal misconnectivity and the sex difference in psychosis. Int Rev Psychiatry. 19(4):449-457.). To provide evidence toward this theory, we analyze the geometry of interhemispheric white matter connections in adolescent-onset schizophrenia, with a particular focus on sex, using a recently introduced framework for white matter geometry computation in diffusion tensor imaging data (Savadjiev P, Kindlmann GL, Bouix S, Shenton ME, Westin CF. 2010. Local white geometry from diffusion tensor gradients. Neuroimage. 49(4):3175-3186.).

Neglected achievements by German psychiatrists around 1880 in the treatment of depressions and psychoses].", "Abstract": "Parallel to the recent reneurobiologization of psychiatry as a subject, therapies based on electricity and elektrcomagnetism are returning to mental health care. Around 1880, the application of brain stimulating treatment on patients was particularly popular among German psychiatrists. This fact has largely been ignored in historical psychiatric research as present day practices, in particular deep brain stimulation (DBS), have frequently been seen solely within the tradition of brain surgery. Against this background the present study aims to revive the first trials of non-surgical electrical brain stimulation on depressive and psychotic patients, highlighting a 2-part study published by Wilhelm Tigges. It was Tigges along with Rudolph Gottfried Arndt and Wilhelm Erb who tried to establish clear rules on the most beneficial application methods and doses. Interestingly, Tigges's therapy was successful in cases of severe depression with chronification potential, i.e. precisely the clinical picture for which brain stimulation therapies are reserved today as a last option and ascribed an easing and even curing potential. Trigges also found that electricity produced almost no positive effect whatsoever with madly insane patients and hence anticipated the current non-application of DBS on these patients. After 1890 electrotherapeutic approaches in psychiatry were marginalized, first and foremost as no clear and reliable rules could be verified for their application, nor could their mode of action be fully explained. The success of electrotherapy in psychiatry was also restricted due to limitations of the time, namely (1) electrophysiology only emerging as a discipline, (2) the electrophysical medical apparatus industry only beginning to be established and (3) the lack of generally accepted guidelines and electrotherapy restriction to individual, barely generalizable experience (eclecticism). Present day applications of electricity, mainly DBS, have overcome these problems."}, {"Title": "Drosophila modifier screens to identify novel neuropsychiatric drugs including aminergic agents for the possible treatment of Parkinson's disease and depression.", "Abstract": "Small molecules that increase the presynaptic function of aminergic cells may provide neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression. Model genetic organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster may enhance the detection of new drugs via modifier or 'enhancer/suppressor' screens, but this technique has not been applied to processes relevant to psychiatry. To identify new aminergic drugs in vivo, we used a mutation in the Drosophila vesicular monoamine transporter (dVMAT) as a sensitized genetic background and performed a suppressor screen. We fed dVMAT mutant larvae \u223c 1000 known drugs and quantitated rescue (suppression) of an amine-dependent locomotor deficit in the larva. To determine which drugs might specifically potentiate neurotransmitter release, we performed an additional secondary screen for drugs that require presynaptic amine storage to rescue larval locomotion. Using additional larval locomotion and adult fertility assays, we validated that at least one compound previously used clinically as an antineoplastic agent potentiates the presynaptic function of aminergic circuits. We suggest that structurally similar agents might be used to development treatments for PD, depression and ADHD, and that modifier screens in Drosophila provide a new strategy to screen for neuropsychiatric drugs. More generally, our findings demonstrate the power of physiologically based screens for identifying bioactive agents for select neurotransmitter systems."}, {"Title": "Unity of opposites? Chronic fatigue syndrome and the challenge of divergent perspectives in guideline development.", "Abstract": "Guideline development by its nature is a process and method of integration and synthesis of information, be it originating from research, evidence-based medicine, clinical findings, patient experience and/or individual narratives of an illness or disease. In the majority of cases, it can be assumed that this information and these ideas are travelling in the same direction; however, it is possible that the objective and subjective cannot be synthesised, and appear mutually contradictory. In this commentary, an example of where this might be the case has been analysed: a report published by the Scottish Public Health Network, a Health Care Needs Assessment of Services for people living with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)/chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). It appears from reflection and analysis of this document that this process may indeed have gone awry. We propose that, if followed, this document would lead to the adoption of dangerous diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, as well as preventing patients from making informed decisions about treatment options, and discouraging clinicians from following evidence-based medicine and recommending proven treatments for ME/CFS, because of potential implications for future commissioning. This commentary seeks to highlight some of the problems, contradictions and unintended consequences of a divergence between patient perspectives and evidence-based medicine despite probably sharing the same aim, that of improving patient care and striving for better understanding and better treatments for disease."}, {"Title": "Neuro psychiatry 1943: the role of documentary film in the dissemination of medical knowledge and promotion of the U.K. psychiatric profession.", "Abstract": "In 1943, Basil Wright produced a documentary film about the treatment of servicemen and civilians with psychological disorders at Mill Hill Emergency Medical Service Hospital. Funded by the Ministry of Information, Neuro Psychiatry was shot to convince influential clinicians and policy makers in North America that the British had developed expertise in the management of psychiatric casualties. By emphasizing novel and apparently effective interventions and excluding severe or intractable cases from the film, Wright encouraged an optimistic sense of achievement. Filmed at a time when victory was considered an eventual outcome, the picture presented a health service to which all had access without charge. Children and unemployed women, two groups excluded under the 1911 National Insurance Act, had been required to pay for healthcare in the prewar period and were shown receiving free treatment from the Emergency Medical Service. However, the therapeutic optimism presented in the film proved premature. Most U.K. battle casualties arose in the latter half of the conflict and follow-up studies failed to confirm the positive outcome statistics reported in the film. Aubrey Lewis, clinical director of the hospital, criticized research projects conducted at Mill Hill for a lack of rigor.

The psychiatric interpretation of this mental and neurological disorder varied depending on the institutional and social context in which it was examined, treated, and discussed by physicians. Psychiatric diagnoses and understandings of this disease had in part a social-cultural basis and can be best explained against the backdrop of the establishment of psychiatry as a medical specialty and the specific efforts of Dutch psychiatrists to expand their professional domain.

Twenty-nine hours after ingestion, the psychiatry team obtained LFTs (AST 45, ALT 61). He had persistent nausea and diffuse abdominal pain. On repeat analysis, the APAP level at 36 hours was found to be <10 \u03bcg/mL, AST 150, and ALT 204. After 2 more days of increasing LFTs and persistent abdominal pain and nausea, the toxicology department was consulted, the patient was transferred to the medicine department, and intravenous N-acetylcysteine was started 66 hours after ingestion. He was treated for 16 hours and had a significant decline in LFTs and symptom resolution. His prothrombin time, bilirubin, lactate, creatinine, and mental status were normal throughout the admission. Other cases of LFT increase were excluded. Our case report illustrates that a moderate increase in liver transaminase may occur despite an initial undetectable APAP level and normal transaminases after a delayed presentation. In our case, no serious clinical effects were reported."}, {"Title": "Efficacy and enlightenment: LSD psychotherapy and the Drug Amendments of 1962.", "Abstract": "The decline in therapeutic research with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in the United States over the course of the 1960s has commonly been attributed to the growing controversy surrounding its recreational use. However, research difficulties played an equal role in LSD psychotherapy's demise, as they frustrated researchers' efforts to clearly establish the efficacy of treatment. Once the Kefauver Harris Drug Amendments of 1962 introduced the requirement that proof of efficacy be established through controlled clinical trials before a drug could be approved to market, the value of clinical research became increasingly dependent on the scientific rigor of the trial's design. LSD psychotherapy's complex method of utilizing drug effects to catalyze a psychological treatment clashed with the controlled trial methodology on both theoretical and practical levels, making proof of efficacy difficult to obtain. Through a close examination of clinical trials performed after 1962, this article explores how the new emphasis on controlled clinical trials frustrated the progress of LSD psychotherapy research by focusing researchers' attention on trial design to the detriment of their therapeutic method. This analysis provides a new perspective on the death of LSD psychotherapy and explores the implications of the Drug Amendments of 1962."}, {"Title": "In search of \"anything that would help\": parent perspectives on emerging neurotechnologies.", "Abstract": "This qualitative study explores parents' perceptions about the future clinical translation of neurotechnologies--neuroimaging and genetic testing separately and together--for instrumentalization in the diagnosis and treatment of childhood ADHD.\nWe conducted in-person, semi-structured interviews with parents of minor children diagnosed with ADHD (N = 26) and analyzed 11.75 hr of data using constant comparative analysis.\nReceptivity to technology and anticipation of potential benefits overshadowed discussion of risks or concerns. Four key areas of potential impact on parent experience are (a) insight and acceptance, (b) treatment and adherence, (c) stigma and blame, and (d) the endeavor to access resources.\nThe findings highlight high receptivity to emerging neurotechnologies for ADHD, key areas for which parents anticipate support from these technologies, and ethics challenges to clinical translation in light of parents' salient hope and minimal consideration of risk in their pursuit of \"anything that would help.\""}, {"Title": "Mutual powerlessness in client participation practices in mental health care.", "Abstract": "Client participation has become a dominant policy goal in many countries including the Netherlands and is a topic much discussed in the literature. The success of client participation is usually measured in terms of the extent to which clients have a say in the participation process. Many articles have concluded that client participation is limited; professionals often still control the participation process and outcomes.\nThe objective of this study is to gain insight into (i) the practice of client participation within a quality improvement collaborative in mental health care and (ii) the consequences of a Foucauldian conceptualization of power in analysing practices of client participation.\nWe used an ethnographic design consisting of observations of national events and improvement team meetings and interviews with the collaborative's team members and programme managers.\nContrary to many studies on client participation, we found both clients and service providers frequently felt powerless in its practice. Professionals and clients alike struggled with the contributions clients could make to the improvement processes and what functions they should fulfil. Moreover, professionals did not want to exert power upon clients, but ironically just for that reason sometimes struggled with shaping practices of client participation. This mutual powerlessness (partly) disappeared when clients helped to determine and execute specific improvement actions instead of participating in improvement teams.\nRecognizing that power is inescapable might allow for a more substantive discussion concerning the consequences that power arrangements produce, rather than looking at who is exerting how much power."}]
