[{"Title": "Bifactor structure of clinical disability in relapsing multiple sclerosis.", "Abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) can affect virtually every neurological function which complicates the conceptualization and assessment of disability. Similar challenges are encountered in other medical fields including child cognitive development and psychiatry, for instance. In these disciplines progress in diagnosis and outcome measurement has been recently achieved by capitalizing on the concept of bifactor model.\nTo present in accessible terms an application of bifactor confirmatory factor analysis to study the clinical disability outcomes in MS.\nData included 480 assessments on 301 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who participated in the North American interferon beta-1a clinical trial (Avonex). Measures consisted of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the three components of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), and five other clinical measures of neurological functions. We determined which of three confirmatory factor analysis models (unidimensional, multidimensional, and bifactor) best described the structure of the data.\nEDSS scores ranged from 0 to 8 (94% between 0 and 4). The final bifactor model fitted the data well, explained 59.4% of total variance, and provided the most useful representation of the data. In this model, the nine measures defined a scoring dimension of global neurological function (63.1% of total composite score variance) and two auxiliary dimensions of extra variability in leg and cognitive function (17.1% and 9% of total composite score variance).\nBifactor modeling is a promising approach to further understanding of the structure of disability in MS and for refining composite measures of global disability."}, {"Title": "Does the Cultural Formulation Interview for the fifth revision of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5) affect medical communication? A qualitative exploratory study from the New York site.", "Abstract": "Cross-cultural mental health researchers often analyze patient explanatory models of illness to optimize service provision. The Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) is a cross-cultural assessment tool released in May 2013 with DSM-5 to revise shortcomings from the DSM-IV Outline for Cultural Formulation (OCF). The CFI field trial took place in 6 countries, 14 sites, and with 321 patients to explore its feasibility, acceptability, and clinical utility with patients and clinicians. We sought to analyze if and how CFI feasibility, acceptability, and clinical utility were related to patient-clinician communication.\nWe report data from the New York site which enrolled 7 clinicians and 32 patients in 32 patient-clinician dyads. We undertook a data analysis independent of the parent field trial by conducting content analyses of debriefing interviews with all participants (n = 64) based on codebooks derived from frameworks for medical communication and implementation outcomes. Three coders created codebooks, coded independently, established inter-rater coding reliability, and analyzed if the CFI affects medical communication with respect to feasibility, acceptability, and clinical utility.\nDespite racial, ethnical, cultural, and professional differences within our group of patients and clinicians, we found that promoting satisfaction through the interview, eliciting data, eliciting the patient's perspective, and perceiving data at multiple levels were common codes that explained how the CFI affected medical communication. We also found that all but two codes fell under the implementation outcome of clinical utility, two fell under acceptability, and none fell under feasibility.\nOur study offers new directions for research on how a cultural interview affects patient-clinician communication. Future research can analyze how the CFI and other cultural interviews impact medical communication in clinical settings with subsequent effects on outcomes such as medication adherence, appointment retention, and health condition."}, {"Title": "A Non-Surgeon's Guide to Surgical Management of Atrial Fibrillation.", "Abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia associated with substantial increases in death, heart failure, and stroke. It is important for healthcare providers in all fields to also gain an understanding of the novel techniques used in surgical treatment of AF. Clinicians must now decide between many different options. There are modified Maze procedures, catheter-based or minimally invasive surgical approaches to isolate the triggers and foci in the left atrium responsible for AF. A recently proposed radial approach can also be employed in substitution of the traditional geographical maze surgery. Finally, different energy sources, such as cryoablation, radiofrequency, microwave, and laser, can be used to create lesions in the atrium. Especially in the fields of neurology, psychiatry, and psychology, an understanding of these treatments is important for the management of AF patients with neurological pathology."}, {"Title": "Conversion disorders: psychiatric and psychotherapeutic aspects.", "Abstract": "Hysteria is still stigmatized and frequently associated with lying or malingering. However, conversion disorder is not malingering, nor factitious disorder. The first step for the clinician faced with suspected conversion disorder is to make a positive diagnosis, which is in fact an integral part of treatment. In the emergency situation, it is important to look for an underlying somatic disorder. Although no specific treatment exists, there is a consensus in favor of a positive role of psychotherapy. First of all, the main problem is to explain to patients that their physical complaint has a psychological cause. In order to deliver the diagnosis in the most appropriate and useful manner, physicians have to first convince themselves before trying to convince patients. Combined consultation (medicine and psychiatry) is a useful tool to help patients. With or without combined consultation, this approach requires patience and open-mindedness to motivate patients to recognize the value of psychotherapy. Coordination between specialists and general practitioners is an important part of this treatment, which frequently requires long-term intervention."}, {"Title": "Neurophysiology of conversion disorders: a historical perspective.", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to present a short historical perspective on the neurophysiological approach to hysteria and conversion disorders. The body of this paper will be constituted of three main parts. In the first part, we will present the significant progress due to some pioneers of neurology/psychiatry during the XIXth century. As we shall see, this period was particularly rich in personalities whose work gradually laid the foundations to a true medical approach to hysteria. In the first half of the XXth century, different factors have led to a long eclipse of the neurological approach to hysteria. In the second part, we will show how, by the 1960's-1970's, the conceptual and methodological advances in neurophysiology, as well as the turning point of cognitive sciences (and cognitive psychology in particular) allowed a gradual reinstatement of hysteria within the fields of neurology and clinical neurophysiology. Finally, and this is the third part of this paper, we will show how over the past three decades, an entirely new neurophysiological approach to hysteria and conversion disorders has emerged."}, {"Title": "Prevention, family, and community.", "Abstract": "The \"Prevention, Family, and Community\" session was chaired by Dr. Joseph Jror-Serk Cheng, who is an expert in community psychiatry and mental health policy and is superintendent of the Bali Psychiatric Center in Taipei.

This problem is common to a number of areas in biology and medicine, for example, obstetrics, neurology/psychiatry, parasitology, virology, oncology, and teratology. It is established that there are signifi cantly biased, but unexplained, sex ratios in each of these fields. Yet workers in them (with the possible exception of virology) have regarded the problem as a minor loose end, irrelevant to the field's major problems. However, as far as I know, no one has previously noted that unexplained biased sex ratios occur, and thus pose (perhaps similar) problems, in all these fields. Here it is suggested that similar sorts of solutions apply in each. Further research is proposed for testing each solution. If the argument here is substantially correct across this range of topics, it may lead to an improved understanding not only of sex ratio but also of some of the pathologies in these specialties."}, {"Title": "[Understanding of the psychiatry in palliative care: dysfunction of the rewarding system under the pain state associated with exacerbating pain].", "Abstract": "Recent human brain imaging studies have examined differences in activity in the nucleus accumbens (N.Acc.) in response to heat stimuli between controls and patients with chronic pain, and have revealed that the N.Acc. plays a role in predicting the value of a noxious stimulus and its offset, and in the consequent changes in the motivational state. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of change in the circuitry involved in emotion and motivation in response to chronic pain stimuli were not fully explored. On the other hand, it has been considered that micro RNAs (miRNAs) play important roles as key modulators of post-transcriptional gene expression. We have reported that changes in miRNAs are associated with predicted changes in gene expression of candidate targets in the N.Acc. under neuropathic pain. Therefore, we have introduced a new insight into an epigenetic dysfunction of \"mesolimbic motivation/valuation circuitry\" under a neuropathic pain-like state. These findings raise intriguing possibilities that miRNA-modulating cellular events along with epigenetic modifications may be associated with neural plasticity and neuronal adaptive responses in mesolimbic motivation/valuation circuitry under which the neuropathic pain may induce negative emotions, exacerbating pain."}, {"Title": "[Perinatal innate immune activation and neuropsychological development].", "Abstract": "Development of animal models is a crucial issue in biological psychiatry for the search of novel drug targets as well as the screening of candidate compounds. Epidemiologic studies suggest that environmental insults, such as prenatal infection and perinatal complication, are involved in the development of schizophrenia. Recently, we have developed a novel mouse model of viral infection during the perinatal stage by injecting polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (polyI:C) into neonatal mice. Neonatal treatment of mice with polyI:C, an inducer of innate immune responses via toll-like receptor 3, caused a significant increase in interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) levels in the astrocytes of the hippocampus, which resulted in long-lasting brain dysfunction, including cognitive and emotional impairments as well as a deficit in depolarization-evoked glutamate release in the hippocampus in adulthood. Neonatal polyI:C-induced neuronal impairments have not been observed in IFITM3-KO mice. These findings suggest that the induction of IFITM3 expression in astrocytes by the activation of the innate immune system during the early stages of neurodevelopment has non-cell autonomous effects that affect subsequent neurodevelopment, leading to neuropathological impairments and brain dysfunction, by impairing endocytosis in astrocytes."}, {"Title": "Predictors of valued everyday occupations, empowerment and satisfaction in day centres: implications for services for persons with psychiatric disabilities.", "Abstract": "This study addresses predictors of occupational value, empowerment and satisfaction with the rehabilitation received in day centres for people with psychiatric disabilities. These outcomes represent varying aspects of relevance for the day centre context and together create a manifold outcome picture. This was a longitudinal study with approval from the regional research vetting board. Self-report instruments were used, and the investigated predictors motivation for going to the day centre, occupational engagement, socio-demographic factors and self-reported diagnosis. Attendees (N = 108) at 8 day centres participated and filled in self-report questionnaires regarding the predictor and outcome variables. A baseline measurement and a 14-month follow-up composed the data. Occupational engagement at baseline could predict all three outcomes at the follow-up. Motivation for the day centre activities and not preferring work before attending the day centre were positive for satisfaction with the day centre. A low participation rate, although comparable with previous studies on the target group, was a limitation of this study. To conclude, both occupational engagement and motivation are factors that can be stimulated by the staff in day centres. Actions for how to accomplish that, and thereby also more positive outcomes of the day centre services, are proposed, such as a system of freedom of choice among day centres, and between day centres and supported employment."}, {"Title": "Therapeutic relationships from the psychiatric nurses' perspectives: an interpretative phenomenological study.", "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to explore the attributes of the therapeutic relationship from the perspective of psychiatric nurses in the United Arab Emirates.\nInterpretive phenomenology formed the framework of the study.

This way, they play an important role in synaptic plasticity and in cognitive, motor, sensory and affective processes. In addition, in some acute or chronic pathologies of central nervous system, such as neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, endocannabinoids can perform a pro-homeostatic and neuroprotective function, through the activation of CB1 and CB2 receptors. Scientific evidence shows that an hypofunction or a dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system may be responsible for some of the symptoms of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.\nThe important role played by endocannabinoid system promises interesting developments, in particular to evaluate the effectiveness of new drugs in both psychiatry and neurology."}, {"Title": "The role of a dedicated staff psychiatrist in modern burn centers.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric disorders may be more common in burn-injured subjects than in the general population, and oftentimes contribute to the injury itself.

Given the newness of alienism and the idiosyncratic structure of the British publishing industry at the time, for a private individual to start a new specialized journal was a major enterprise. Against all odds, Forbes Winslow managed to publish his journal from 1848 to 1860, and during this period the scholarly nature of his publication could not be matched by the Asylum Journal, the official publication of the Association of Medical Officers of Asylums and Hospitals for the Insane. Under the title Psychological Medicine, Winslow offered a new view of alienism which he clearly conceived as a discipline broader than medicine. He strove to inform his readers about the conceptual and practical complexities that then (as now) beset and besiege the care of the mentally ill. He taught his readers that to understand and manage insanity, knowledge of philosophy and of the human sciences was as important as knowledge about the brain.

These so-called spiritist or mediumistic delusions were the object of detailed study, and clinicians assigned them a place in nosography, especially in France. This work of classification was carried out as a function of the convictions and paradoxes that these delusions aroused; it also made it possible to question the relationship between pathology and belief. It is therefore important to emphasize certain ideological views of psychiatry on para-normality.

The aim is to discuss the role played by psychoanalytic and psychodynamic thinking in this process of change. When mental health services for children were introduced in the mid-1940s, psychoanalytic thinking was intertwined with the social democratic vision of the Swedish welfare state in which children symbolized the future. In practice, however, treatment ideology was initially less influenced by psychoanalytic thinking. From the early 1960s, child psychiatric services expanded and the number of units increased. By then, the political vision had disappeared, but a treatment ideology began to evolve based on psychodynamic theories, which became dominant in the 1970s."}, {"Title": "Mental health issues of Maria I of Portugal and her sisters: the contributions of the Willis family to the development of psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Contemporary accounts credit Dr Francis Willis (1718-1807) with facilitating the recovery of King George III from his major episode of acute mania in 1788-9. Subsequently Willis was summoned to Lisbon to advise on the mental health problems of Queen Maria I. This article reports the nature of the illnesses of Maria and her two similarly affected sisters, and uses the program OPCRIT to propose diagnoses of major depressive disorders. The high prevalence of consanguinity and insanity among the Portuguese monarchy and their antecedents probably contributed to their mental health problems.

Therefore, the aim of this retrospective case series was to analyze the effectiveness of Lasea\u00ae for patients with MDD and symptoms of anxiety, insomnia and psychomotor agitation.\nEight cases were analyzed retrospectively regarding the dosage, length of treatment, possible side effects and effectiveness of Lasea\u00ae.\nAll cases were treated at the Department of Psychiatry at Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin in a naturalistic setting.\nEffectiveness was measured by a change in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) total score and subscores.\nIn 6 cases, the combination of Lasea\u00ae and an antidepressant resulted in a reduction of MDD. Lasea\u00ae also reduced agitation in 6 cases. Psychological anxiety was reduced in 5, somatic anxiety in 4 cases whereas sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia improved in 3 cases each.\nThe results demonstrate that Lasea\u00ae reduces some of the anxiety related symptoms and sleep disturbances in MDD patients.

Preparation of the protocol and conduct of the study was as per the WHO - DUS and the STROBE guidelines.\nDrug use indicators - In 600 prescriptions, 1074 (88.25%) were psychotropic drugs. The utilization from the National and WHO EML was 100% and 90%, respectively. Average number of psychotropic drugs per prescription was 1.79 \u00b1 1.02 (SD). 22.5% of the prescriptions contained psychotropic FDCs. 76.01% of drugs were prescribed by generic name. Percentage of psychotropic drugs prescribed from the hospital drug schedule and psychotropic drugs actually dispensed from the hospital drug store were 73.1% and 62.3%, respectively. Drug utilization pattern in different psychiatric disorders - Most commonly prescribed drugs for schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, depression and anxiety disorders were trifluoperazine + trihexiphenydyl (63.9%), carbamazepine (17.2%), amitriptyline (34.9%), and diazepam (23.8%), respectively. The least commonly prescribed drugs were levosulpiride (1.7%), lithium (1.3%), bupropion (4.7%) and clozapine (1.9%), respectively. The PDD/DDD ratio of three drugs - haloperidol, pimozide and amitriptyline - was equal to one. The cost borne by the hospital was 116, i.e., 65.2% of the total cost. The cost index of clozapine was 11.2.\nOverall, the principles of rational prescribing were followed. The hospital drug schedule should include more SSRIs. The practice of using 1(st) generation/ typical anti-psychotics as the first line was as per current recommendations.

Nevertheless, clinical and biological heterogeneity within phenomenological categories mandates the need to individualise care. However, social and cultural context, patient beliefs about causation, impact, treatment and outcome expectations are never systematically elicited, as they were not essential to diagnosis and classification. Patient experience and narratives are trivialised and the biomedical model is considered universal and transcendental. The need to elicit patient perspectives, evaluate local reality, assess culture, educate patients about possible interventions, and negotiate a shared plan of management between patient and clinician is cardinal for success.

India's National Mental Health Program (NMHP) intended to attend to the mental health needs of all her citizens. Some aspects of this program bear significant resemblance to what recent experts in global mental health (GMH) have been proposing. The paper uses India as a country-level example to review and critically analyze the contextual background culminating in the formulation of the NMHP. Literature searches from two bibliographic databases (PubMed and Google Scholar) with supplementary searches and manual search from Indian Journal of Psychiatry were made relating to the context of formulation of India's NMHP. The search helped isolate 12 peer reviewed journal articles, three chapters from books, and one policy group approach paper. This literature has been synthesized to enumerate the various contextual factors. The present analysis identifies two vital factors relevant for international health, viz. the primary health care movement and the changing concepts of institutional care/de-institutionalization in mental health. This then puts in perspective the opportunities allowed and challenges produced, for NMHP, by subsequent changes in public health services in India. The lessons for GMH movement are then pointed out."}, {"Title": "Serum nerve growth factor levels in autistic children in Turkish population: a preliminary study.", "Abstract": "It has been hypothesized that abnormal levels of serum nerve growth factor (NGF) may represent a serological marker for autistic children who may develop cognitive impairment, regression and finally epilepsy.

The clinical characteristics of the patients with 'low insomnia' (summed score \u22643 on the HAMD subscale) and 'high insomnia' (score \u22654) were compared using statistical analyses. A logistic regression model was constructed to identify factors associated with 'high insomnia' status.\nSymptoms of insomnia were present in 93% of patients, while simultaneous early, middle, and late insomnia affected 64.1%. The high insomnia patients were characterized by significantly greater age, higher symptom levels (including core, gastrointestinal somatic and anxiety symptoms, and suicidal ideation), higher global severity and incidence of physical disorders, and greater insight. Explanatory factors of 'high insomnia' status were older age, higher gastrointestinal somatic and anxiety symptom levels, higher global severity, and greater insight.\nIn clinical psychiatry, insomnia has been significantly underdiagnosed and undertreated.

There is a natural affinity between ethics and psychotherapy. Psychotherapy practice is concerned with human problems, dilemmas and emotions related to both one's own and other people's values. Ethics is also concerned with dilemmas in human thinking and with how these dilemmas reflect other individuals' values. Philosophical reflection itself is not a sufficient basis for the ethics of psychotherapy but it may aid in exploring attitudes related to psychotherapy, psychiatry and health care.\nPubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases were searched for articles containing the keywords \"psychotherapy\", \"ethics\", \"therapeutic relationship\" and \"supervision\". The search was conducted by repeating the terms in various combinations without language or time restrictions. Also included were data from monographs cited in reviews. The resulting text is a review with conclusions concerning ethical aspects of psychotherapy.\nThe ability to behave altruistically, sense for justice and reciprocity and mutual help are likely to be genetically determined as dispositions to be later developed by upbringing or to be formed or deformed by upbringing. Early experiences lead to formation of ethical attitudes which are internalized and then applied to both one's own and other people's behavior. Altruistic behavior has a strong impact on an individual's health and its acceptance may positively influence the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying numerous diseases. Ethical theory and reflection, however, may be applied to both theory and practice of psychotherapy in a conscious, targeted and thoughtful manner. In everyday practice, psychotherapists and organizations must necessarily deal with conscious conflicts between therapeutic possibilities, clients' wishes, their own as well as clients' ideas and the real world. Understanding one's own motives in therapy is one of the aims of a psychotherapist's personal therapy and a frequent goal of supervision interventions. It is a psychotherapist's ethical obligation to do no harm, maintain clear therapeutic borders, not abuse patients, undertake supervision and learn good self-reflection.\nKnowledge of ethical questions and related issues as well as continuous ethical self-reflection are essential components of high-quality psychotherapeutic management.

Method A prospective observational study was developed between October 2011 and January 2013, which involved 107 subjects aged 65 years or older that were hospitalised in the Department of Internal Medicine and referred to the LOAP service. Psychiatric diagnostic was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method, the Geriatric Depression Scale, the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Clinical Global Impression Scale. Results Delirium (40.6%), depression (22.4%) and dementia (20.4%) were the most common psychiatric diagnoses. Patients with delirium were significantly older, had more severe psychiatric symptomatology (mean CGI = 5.35) and presented infectious processes as acute medical conditions more frequently than the other patients. Conclusion Psychiatric disturbances occurring in elderly inpatients in medical wards are highly prevalent and complex.

These results suggest that while physicians may be able to identify patients at high risk of early readmission, issuing a pass may not fully mitigate this risk. There is a need for critical research evaluating the potential benefits of passes."}, {"Title": "John Langdon Down: Down's syndrome.", "Abstract": "When I was a medical student in the 1940's we youngsters were well familiar with the condition called 'Mongolism'.

This review aimed to explore epidemiology, clinical features, comorbidities, and treatment options for BDD in different clinical settings.\nA search of the literature from 1970 to 2011 was performed using the MEDLINE search engine. English-language articles, with no restriction regarding the type of articles, were identified using the search terms body dysmorphic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder clinical settings, body dysmorphic disorder treatment, and body dysmorphic disorder & psychodermatology.\nBDD occurs in 0.7% to 2.4% of community samples and 13% of psychiatric inpatients. Etiology is multifactorial, with recent findings indicating deficits in visual information processing. There is considerable overlap between BDD and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in symptom etiology and response to treatment, which has led to suggestions that BDD can be classified with anxiety disorders and OCD. A recent finding indicated genetic overlap between BDD and OCD. Over 60% of patients with BDD had a lifetime anxiety disorder, and 38% had social phobia, which tends to predate the onset of BDD. Studies reported a high level of comorbidity with depression and social phobia occurring in > 70% of patients with BDD. Individuals with BDD present frequently to dermatologists (about 9%-14% of dermatologic patients have BDD). BDD co-occurs with pathological skin picking in 26%-45% of cases. BDD currently has 2 variants: delusional and nondelusional, and both variants respond similarly to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), which may have effect on obsessive thoughts and rituals. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has the best established treatment results.\nA considerable overlap exists between BDD and other psychiatric disorders such as OCD, anxiety, and delusional disorder, and this comorbidity should be considered in evaluation, management, and long-term follow-up of the disorder. Individuals with BDD usually consult dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons rather than psychiatrists.

Recent work suggests that these disturbances might be due to a deficit in actively using information to guide changes in behavior. However, how much information is actually used to guide behavior is difficult to observe directly. Therefore, we used a computational model to estimate the use of information during learning. Thirty-six female subjects were recruited based on their total scores on the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI), a self-report psychopathy list, and performed a task involving simultaneous learning of reward-based and social information. A Bayesian reinforcement-learning model was used to parameterize the use of each source of information during learning. Subsequently, we used the subscales of the PPI to assess psychopathy-related traits, and the traits that were strongly related to the model's parameters were isolated through a formal variable selection procedure. Finally, we assessed how these covaried with model parameters. We succeeded in isolating key personality traits believed to be relevant for psychopathy that can be related to model-based descriptions of subject behavior. Use of reward-history information was negatively related to levels of trait anxiety and fearlessness, whereas use of social advice decreased as the perceived ability to manipulate others and lack of anxiety increased. These results corroborate previous findings suggesting that sub-optimal use of different types of information might be implicated in psychopathy. They also further highlight the importance of considering the potential of computational modeling to understand the role of latent variables, such as the weight people give to various sources of information during goal-directed behavior, when conducting research on psychopathy-related traits and in the field of forensic psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Visual capture and the experience of having two bodies - Evidence from two different virtual reality techniques.", "Abstract": "In neurology and psychiatry the detailed study of illusory own body perceptions has suggested close links between bodily processing and self-consciousness. One such illusory own body perception is heautoscopy where patients have the sensation of being reduplicated and to exist at two or even more locations. In previous experiments, using a video head-mounted display, self-location and self-identification were manipulated by applying conflicting visuo-tactile information. Yet the experienced singularity of the self was not affected, i.e., participants did not experience having multiple bodies or selves. In two experiments presented in this paper, we investigated self-location and self-identification while participants saw two virtual bodies (video-generated in study 1 and 3D computer generated in study 2) that were stroked either synchronously or asynchronously with their own body. In both experiments, we report that self-identification with two virtual bodies was stronger during synchronous stroking. Furthermore, in the video generated setup with synchronous stroking participants reported a greater feeling of having multiple bodies than in the control conditions. In study 1, but not in study 2, we report that self-location - measured by anterior posterior drift - was significantly shifted towards the two bodies in the synchronous condition only. Self-identification with two bodies, the sensation of having multiple bodies, and the changes in self-location show that the experienced singularity of the self can be studied experimentally. We discuss our data with respect to ownership for supernumerary hands and heautoscopy. We finally compare the effects of the video and 3D computer generated head-mounted display technology and discuss the possible benefits of using either technology to induce changes in illusory self-identification with a virtual body."}, {"Title": "Developing better and more valid animal models of brain disorders.", "Abstract": "Valid sensitive animal models are crucial for understanding the pathobiology of complex human disorders, such as anxiety, autism, depression and schizophrenia, which all have the 'spectrum' nature.

Despite substantial progress with regard to the neuronal underpinnings of psychosis development, the crucial biological mechanisms leading to manifest illness are yet insufficiently understood. Until today, one significant approach to elucidate the neurobiology of psychosis has been the modeling of psychotic symptoms by psychedelic substances in healthy individuals. These models bear the opportunity to evoke particular neuronal aberrations and the respective psychotic symptoms in a controlled experimental setting. In the present paper, we hypothesize that experimental psychiatry bears unique opportunities in elucidating the biological mechanisms of the prodromal stages of psychosis. Psychosis risk symptoms are attenuated, transient, and often only retrospectively reported. The respective neuronal aberrations are thought being dynamic. The correlation of unstable psychopathology with observed neurofunctional disturbances is thus yet largely unclear. In modeling psychosis, the experimental setting allows not only for evoking particular symptoms, but for the concomitant assessment of psychopathology, neurophysiology, and neuropsychology. Herein, the glutamatergic model will be highlighted exemplarily, with special emphasis on its potential contribution to the elucidation of psychosis development. This model of psychosis appears as candidate for modeling the prodrome by inducing psychotic-like symptoms in healthy individuals. Furthermore, it alters pre-attentive processing like the Mismatch Negativity, an electrophysiological component which has recently been identified as a potential predictive marker of psychosis development. In summary, experimental psychiatry bears the potential to further elucidate the biological mechanisms of the psychosis prodrome. A better understanding of the respective pathophysiology might assist in the identification of predictive markers, and the development of preventive treatments."}, {"Title": "Exploring the Influence of Environment on the Spatial Behavior of Older Adults in a Purpose-Built Acute Care Dementia Unit.", "Abstract": "Limited research explores the experience of individuals with dementia in acute care geriatric psychiatry units.

However, at the time, commercially available human ELISA kits were unable to distinguish between pro-BDNF (precursor BDNF) and mature BDNF, because of limited antibody specificity. Here, we used new ELISA kits, to examine serum levels of mature BDNF and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which converts pro-BDNF to mature BDNF in schizophrenia. Sixty-three patients with chronic schizophrenia and 52 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Patients were evaluated using the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale, the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and neuropsychological tests. Neither serum mature BDNF nor MMP-9 levels differed between patients and controls. In male subgroups, serum MMP-9 levels of smoking patients were higher than those of non-smoking patients, but this was not observed in male controls or the female subgroup. In patients, serum mature BDNF levels were associated with SANS total scores and the Information subtest scores of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised (WAIS-R), while serum MMP-9 levels were associated with smoking and category fluency scores.

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) was confirmed during an autopsy. It was diagnosed according to the Boston criteria. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy can involve all kinds of cerebral vessels (cortical and leptomeningeal arterioles, capillaries and veins). The development of CAA is a progressive process. \u03b2-amyloid appears first in the tunica media, surrounding smooth muscle cells, and in the adventitia. \u03b2-amyloid is progressively accumulated, causing a gradual loss of smooth muscle cells in the vessel wall and finally replacing them.

One-quarter of the study sample met the criteria for mixed subtype (n\u2009=\u200979; 24.61%), about one-fifth of the study sample met the criteria for hypoactive delirium subtype (n\u2009=\u200964; 19.93%), and only very few patients (n\u2009=\u200917; 5.29%) did not meet the required criteria for any of these three subtypes and were categorized as 'no subtype'. When the hyperactive and hypoactive subtypes were compared, significant differences were seen in the prevalence of perceptual disturbances, delusions, lability of affect, thought process abnormality, motor agitation and motor retardation. All the symptoms were more common in the hyperactive subtype except for thought process abnormality and motor retardation. Compared to hyperactive subtype, the mixed subtype had significantly higher prevalence of thought process abnormality and motor retardation. Significant differences emerged with regard to perceptual disturbances, delusions, lability of affect and motor agitation when comparing the patients with mixed subtype with those with hypoactive subtype. All these symptoms were found to be more common in the mixed subtype. No significant differences emerged for the cognitive symptoms as assessed on Delirium Rating scale-Revised-98 across the different motoric subtypes.\nDifferent motoric subtypes of delirium differ on non-cognitive symptoms."}, {"Title": "Annual research review: The neuroinflammation hypothesis for stress and psychopathology in children--developmental psychoneuroimmunology.", "Abstract": "Experimental animal and adult human data suggest that stress exposure is associated with alterations in immune system function that may underlie increased susceptibility to disease and behavioral disorders.

Robins to North American psychiatric epidemiology.", "Abstract": "This article takes up the history of North American psychiatric epidemiology with reference to production of knowledge concerning sociopathic or antisocial personality disorder and drug dependence, abuse, and/or addiction. These overlapping arenas provide a microcosm within which to explore the larger shift of postwar psychiatric epidemiology from community studies based on psychological scales to studies based on specific diagnostic criteria. This paper places the figure of sociologist Lee Nelken Robins within the context of the Department of Psychiatry in the School of Medicine at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. The St Louis research group--to which Robins was both marginal and central--developed the basis for specific diagnostic criteria and was joined by Robert Spitzer, Jean Endicott and other architects of DSM-III in reorienting American psychiatry towards medical, biological and epidemiological models. Robins was a key linchpin working at the nexus of the psychiatric epidemiological and sociological drug addiction research networks. This article situates her work within the broader set of societal and governmental transformations leading to the technologically sophisticated turn in American psychiatric epidemiology and research on the aetiology of drug abuse and mental health and illness."}, {"Title": "Retention in psychiatric treatment in a Canadian sample of HIV-positive women.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is more prevalent in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) than in the general population. This is a concern as MDD is associated with decreased adherence to HIV treatment and contributes significantly to disability and reduced quality of life. Several studies report that, while prevalence is high, people living with HIV often do not access or follow-up with treatment of MDD. This paper examined adherence to psychiatric treatment in women living with HIV in Ontario, Canada. One-third of women referred to a psychiatry outpatient clinic did not attend their first appointment. Over half of the women who did attend came for only one or two appointments and were lost to follow-up. Potential contributing factors were examined.

Moreover, stress-sensitive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats, which display anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, exhibit GI disturbances akin to those observed in stress-related GI disorders. Additionally, there is mounting preclinical and clinical evidence implicating mast cells as significant contributors to the development of abdominal visceral pain in IBS. In this study we examined the effects of the rat connective tissue mast cell (CTMC) stabiliser, disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) on visceral hypersensitivity and colonic ion transport, and examined both colonic and peritoneal mast cells from stress-sensitive WKY rats. DSCG significantly decreased abdominal pain behaviors induced by colorectal distension in WKY animals independent of a reduction in colonic rat mast cell mediator release. We further demonstrated that mast cell-stimulated colonic ion transport was sensitive to inhibition by the mast cell stabiliser DSCG, an effect only observed in stress-sensitive rats. Moreover, CTMC-like mast cells were significantly increased in the colonic submucosa of WKY animals, and we observed a significant increase in the proportion of intermediate, or immature, peritoneal mast cells relative to control animals. Collectively our data further support a role for mast cells in the pathogenesis of stress-related GI disorders."}, {"Title": "Off-patent generic medicines vs. off-patent brand medicines for six reference drugs: a retrospective claims data study from five local healthcare units in the Lombardy Region of Italy.", "Abstract": "The scientific documentation supporting the potential clinical and economic benefits of a growing use of off-patent generic drugs in clinical practice seems to be limited in Italy as yet.\nWe compared differences in outcomes between off-patent generic drugs and off-patent brand drugs in real clinical practice. The outcomes were: persistence and compliance with therapy, mortality, and other health resources consumption (hospitalizations, specialist examinations, other drugs) and total costs. Retrospective analysis was carried out by using the administrative databases of five Local Healthcare Units (ASLs - Aziende Sanitarie Locali) in the Lombardy Region of Italy. Data from the five ASLs were aggregated through a meta-analysis, which produced an estimate indicator of the mean or percentage difference between the two groups (branded vs. generic) and their respective significance tests. The therapeutic areas and studied drugs were: diabetes: metformin - A10BA02; hypertension: amlodipine - C08CA01; dyslipidemia: simvastatin - C10AA01; psychiatry: sertraline - N06AB06; cardiology: propafenone - C01BC03; osteoporosis: alendronate - M05BA04.\nThe 5 Local Healthcare Units (ASL) represent a population of 3,847,004 inhabitants.

This study's goal is to review strengths and limitations of literature comparing psychiatric categories with cultural concepts of distress (CCD) such as cultural syndromes, culture-bound syndromes, and idioms of distress.\nThe Systematic Assessment of Quality in Observational Research (SAQOR) was adapted based on cultural psychiatry principles to develop a Cultural Psychiatry Epidemiology version (SAQOR-CPE), which was used to rate quality of quantitative studies comparing CCD and psychiatric categories. A meta-analysis was performed for each psychiatric category.\nForty-five studies met inclusion criteria, with 18 782 unique participants. Primary objectives of the studies included comparing CCD and psychiatric disorders (51%), assessing risk factors for CCD (18%) and instrument validation (16%). Only 27% of studies met SAQOR-CPE criteria for medium quality, with the remainder low or very low quality. Only 29% of studies employed representative samples, 53% used validated outcome measures, 44% included function assessments and 44% controlled for confounding. Meta-analyses for anxiety, depression, PTSD and somatization revealed high heterogeneity (I(2) > 75%). Only general psychological distress had low heterogeneity (I(2) = 8%) with a summary effect odds ratio of 5.39 (95% CI 4.71-6.17). Associations between CCD and psychiatric disorders were influenced by methodological issues, such as validation designs (\u03b2 = 16.27, 95%CI 12.75-19.79) and use of CCD multi-item checklists (\u03b2 = 6.10, 95%CI 1.89-10.31). Higher quality studies demonstrated weaker associations of CCD and psychiatric disorders.\nCultural concepts of distress are not inherently unamenable to epidemiological study. However, poor study quality impedes conceptual advancement and service application. With improved study design and reporting using guidelines such as the SAQOR-CPE, CCD research can enhance detection of mental health problems, reduce cultural biases in diagnostic criteria and increase cultural salience of intervention trial outcomes."}, {"Title": "Assisted suicide in the care of mentally ill patients: the Lucio Magri's case.", "Abstract": "A year after Mario Monicelli's suicide, the death of another famous person in Italy, Lucio Magri, reawakened the Italian debate on social, ethical and juridical issues in end-of-life decisions.

According to Jaspers, it is impossible to understand any of the serious mental disorders often referred to as 'psychosis' because of their unreasonableness, a truth that is revealed when one attempts to empathize with the mental states of patients afflicted with a particular mental disorder. These elements are psychologically inaccessible and closed to any form of empathy. The theory of incomprehensibility is the starting point for many contemporary discussions on the nature of mental illness. It refers to the pathogenic causes of mental disorder and, at the same time, leads to the marginalization of 'pathoplastic'--personal, family related and environmental factors responsible for mental distress. The presented article criticizes the theory of incomprehensibility in light of the contemporary discussion within the (new) philosophy of psychiatry about the role and function of psychiatry and psychopathology. Many authors criticize the theory of incomprehensibility, particularly its implications for understanding and explaining mental disorders. The views presented in the article--post-psychiatry, the psychiatry of common sense, the socio-cultural approach and engaged epistemology/embodied cognition--aim to reveal the broader dimensions of human pathological experience. Particularly appreciated by the author, engaged epistemology and embodied cognition aim to connect social and experiential points of view with the more scientific neuropsychiatric research, and refer to the hidden levels of our experience while always placing such elements in the social context, as well as describing human pathological symptoms against this social background.

Migrants and their children have to face the acculturation process and may experience a culture-clash. The pathology can also fulfil a positive acculturative function. This is a case study concerning a second-generation Chinese girl born in France presenting with anorexia nervosa.

The clinical observation of a mixture of symptoms emerging from usually opposite clinical conditions is classical. In the 70s, a syndromic specification fixed the main symptom combinations but that incongruous assortment failed to stabilize the nosological concept. Then stricter criteriology was proposed. To be too restrictive, a consensus operates a dimensional opening that attempts to meet the pragmatic requirements of nosology validating the usefulness of the class system. This alternation between rigor of categorization and return to a more flexible criteriological option reflects the search for the right balance between nosology and diagnosis. The definition of mixed states is best determined by their clinical and prognostic severity, related to the risk of suicide, their lower therapeutic response, the importance of their psychiatric comorbidities, anxiety, emotional lability, alcohol abuse. Trying to compensate for the lack of categorical definitions and better reflecting the clinical field problems, new definitions complement criteriology with dimensional aspects, particularly taking into account temperaments."}, {"Title": "[Short history of mixed states].", "Abstract": "The notion of mixed states is classically associated with descriptions and categories inherited from Kraepelin.

As part of a process to improve the quality of care, the French Association for Biological Psychiatry and Neuropsychopharmacology (AFPBN) elaborated guidelines for the use and management of antipsychotic depots in clinical practice.\nBased on a literature review, a written survey was prepared that asked about 539 options in 32 specific clinical situations concerning 3 fields: target-population, prescription and use, and specific populations. We contacted 53 national experts, 42 of whom (79%) completed the survey. The options were scored using a 9-point scale derived from the Rand Corporation and the University of California in the USA. According to the answers, a categorical rank (first-line/preferred choice, second-line/alternate choice, third-line/usually inappropriate) was assigned to each option. The first-line option was defined as a strategy rated as 7-9 (extremely appropriate) by at least 50% of the experts. The following results summarize the key recommendations from the guidelines after data analysis and interpretation of the results of the survey by the scientific committee.\nLAI antipsychotics are indicated in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder and bipolar disorder. LAI second-generation antipsychotics are recommended as maintenance treatment after the first episode of schizophrenia. LAI first-generation antipsychotics are not recommended in the early course of schizophrenia and are not usually appropriate in bipolar disorder. LAI antipsychotics have long been viewed as a treatment that should only be used for a small subgroup of patients with non-compliance, frequent relapses or who pose a risk to others. The panel considers that LAI antipsychotics should be considered and systematically proposed to any patients for whom maintenance antipsychotic treatment is indicated. Recommendations for medication management when switching oral antipsychotics to LAI antipsychotics are proposed. Recommendations are also given for the use of LAI in specific populations.\nIn an evidence-based clinical approach, psychiatrists, through shared decision-making, should be systematically offering to most patients that require long-term antipsychotic treatment an LAI antipsychotic as a first-line treatment."}, {"Title": "Proposals for Mental Health in Italy at the End of the Nineteenth Century: between Utopia and Anticipating the \"Basaglia Law\".", "Abstract": "The present work refers to the debate which took place in Italy in the final years of the nineteenth century in relation to mental health and lunatic asylums, from which emerged various innovative proposals for avoiding compulsory confinement in numerous cases.

In this paper I focus on three articulations of hope within Jewish and Christian tradition-the Summa theologiae of Thomas Aquinas, the lament psalms of the Hebrew Bible, and the post-Holocaust writing of Emil Fackenheim-to argue that attention to these sustaining contexts is essential for understanding what religious traditions mean by hope.

We conducted an anonymous survey among the clinical staff of psychiatry and psychotherapy departments in German university hospitals and faith-based clinics in the same cities. Two main instruments were used, the Duke University Religion Index (DUREL) and the questionnaire from Curlin et al. \"Religion and Spirituality in Medicine: Physicians' Perspectives.\" A total of 123 psychiatrists participated in this survey. However, due to incomplete responses, only 99 questionnaires from psychiatrists were analyzed. Results show that German psychiatrists positively experience the influence of ReS on patients' mental health. Psychiatrists' own ReS significantly influenced their interpretation of the effect of ReS on psychiatric patients as well as their attitude toward ReS in the clinical setting. The more religious psychiatrists are, the more they tend to observe a positive influence of ReS on mental health. In light of these results, psychiatrists should be aware of their own religious/spiritual characteristics and also reconsider their assumptions about professional neutrality and value openness. Furthermore, training programs on religious/spiritual issues and effective teamwork with chaplains are recommended."}, {"Title": "Why it is time to develop the use of cognitive event-related potentials in the treatment of psychiatric diseases.", "Abstract": "The relapse rate for many psychiatric disorders is staggeringly high, indicating that treatment methods combining psychotherapy with neuropharmacological interventions are not entirely effective. Therefore, in psychiatry, there is a current push to develop alternatives to psychotherapy and medication-based approaches. Cognitive deficits have gained considerable importance in the field as critical features of mental illness, and it is now believed that they might represent valid therapeutic targets. Indeed, an increase in cognitive skills has been shown to have a long-lasting, positive impact on the patients' quality of life and their clinical symptoms. We hereby present four principal arguments supporting the use of event-related potentials (ERP) that are derived from electroencephalography, which allow the identification of specific neurocognitive deficiencies in patients. These arguments could assist psychiatrists in the development of individualized, targeted therapy, as well as a follow-up and rehabilitation plan specific to each patient's deficit. Furthermore, they can be used as a tool to assess the possible benefits of combination therapy, consisting of medication, psychotherapy, and \"ERP-oriented cognitive rehabilitation\". Using this strategy, specific cognitive interventions could be planned based on each patient's needs, for an \"individualized\" or \"personalized\" therapy, which may have the potential to reduce relapse rates for many psychiatric disorders. The implementation of such a combined approach would require intense collaboration between psychiatry departments, clinical neurophysiology laboratories, and neuropsychological rehabilitation centers."}, {"Title": "A survey of community pharmacists and final-year student pharmacists and their perception of psychotherapeutic agents.", "Abstract": "The World Health Organization has estimated that as many as 450 million people worldwide have mental disorders.

While it is necessary to acknowledge the utility of current dominant and well-established protocols, it is also imperative to note and correct their failures and limitations. This paper illustrates a model which simultaneously comprehends and designates the negative dimensions of the humanitarian catastrophe of torture and brings forth monumental and profound positive strengths of character which sustain survivors. One case drawn from two decades of evaluations of torture demonstrates this innovative update of mainstream medical-scientific practice. A reproducible and easily communicated heuristic model respects clinical variables and reports the interactivity of individual psychological factors with the cultural/ political nexus. A consistent pattern emerged from review of country reports, survivors' affidavits, interviews, reports and testimonies to the court. Ordinary means led to extraordinary findings that were needed to incorporate and supersede the previous paradigms that have defined torture and designated capacities of psychological response. Torture is a crime of specific intent- to deconstruct and shatter the human connections of their subjects. Survivors had the force of human ties to sustain them. Necessary and legitimate methods achieve valid examination and forensic reporting.

Several studies have demonstrated anomalous structural and functional superior temporal gyrus (STG) symmetries in schizophrenia. We examined bipolar patients to determine if they also have altered STG asymmetry.\nWhole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of auditory evoked fields were obtained for 20 subjects with schizophrenia, 20 with bipolar disorder, and 20 control subjects. Neural generators of the M100 auditory response were modeled using a single equivalent current dipole for each hemisphere. The source location of the M100 response was used as a measure of functional STG asymmetry.\nControl subjects showed the typical M100 asymmetrical pattern with more anterior sources in the right STG. In contrast, both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients displayed a symmetrical M100 source pattern. There was no significant difference in the M100 latency and strength in bilateral hemispheres within three groups.\nOur results indicate that disturbed asymmetry of temporal lobe function may reflect a common deviance present in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, suggesting the two disorders might share etiological and pathophysiological factors."}, {"Title": "Concordant response to pharmacotherapy in monozygotic twins with schizoaffective disorder.", "Abstract": "Schizoaffective disorder (SAD) represents one of the most confusing and controversial concepts in psychiatry.

A perspective from cognitive-affective science.", "Abstract": "Defining disease and disorder remains a key conceptual question in philosophy of medicine and psychiatry, and is currently a very practical matter for psychiatric nosology, given the new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, and the upcoming International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision. There have been advances in the cognitive-affective science of human categorization, and it is timely to consider implications for our understanding of the category of psychiatric disorder. The category of mental disorder has graded boundaries, and conditions within this category can be conceptualized using MEDICAL or MORAL metaphors. One key set of constructs used in MEDICAL metaphors relates to the notion of dysfunction, and it may, in turn, be useful to conceptualize such dysfunction in evolutionary terms. For typical disorders, it is relatively easy to agree that dysfunction is present. However, for atypical disorders, there may be considerable debate about the presence and extent of dysfunction. Rational arguments can be brought to bear to help decide whether particular entities should be included in our nosologies, and, if so, what their boundaries should be. However, it is appropriate that there should be ongoing debate on diagnostic validity, clinical utility, and other relevant facts and values, for cases that are difficult to decide. The perspective here can be illustrated using many nosological debates within the anxiety disorders and the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, including the question of delineating normal from abnormal anxiety, of deciding whether anxiety is psychiatric or medical, and the debate about the optimal meta-structure for anxiety disorders."}, {"Title": "The neuroscience of free will: implications for psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Belief in free will has been a mainstay in philosophy throughout history, grounded in large part in our intuitive sense that we consciously control our actions and could have done otherwise. However, psychology and psychiatry have long sought to uncover mechanistic explanations for human behavior that challenge the notion of free will. In recent years, neuroscientific discoveries have produced a model of volitional behavior that is at odds with the notion of contra-causal free will and our sense of conscious agency. Volitional behavior instead appears to have antecedents in unconscious brain activity that is localizable to specific neuroanatomical structures. Updating notions of free will in favor of a continuous model of volitional self-control provides a useful paradigm to conceptualize and study some forms of psychopathology such as addiction and impulse control disorders. Similarly, thinking of specific symptoms of schizophrenia as disorders of agency may help to elucidate mechanisms of psychosis. Beyond clinical understanding and etiological research, a neuroscientific model of volitional behavior has the potential to modernize forensic notions of responsibility and criminal punishment in order to inform public policy. Ultimately, moving away from the language of free will towards the language of volitional control may result in an enhanced understanding of the very nature of ourselves."}, {"Title": "Depression and decision-making capacity for treatment or research: a systematic review.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric disorders can pose problems in the assessment of decision-making capacity (DMC). This is so particularly where psychopathology is seen as the extreme end of a dimension that includes normality. Depression is an example of such a psychiatric disorder. Four abilities (understanding, appreciating, reasoning and ability to express a choice) are commonly assessed when determining DMC in psychiatry and uncertainty exists about the extent to which depression impacts capacity to make treatment or research participation decisions.\nA systematic review of the medical ethical and empirical literature concerning depression and DMC was conducted. Medline, EMBASE and PsycInfo databases were searched for studies of depression and consent and DMC. Empirical studies and papers containing ethical analysis were extracted and analysed.\n17 publications were identified. The clinical ethics studies highlighted appreciation of information as the ability that can be impaired in depression, indicating that emotional factors can impact on DMC. The empirical studies reporting decision-making ability scores also highlighted impairment of appreciation but without evidence of strong impact. Measurement problems, however, looked likely. The frequency of clinical judgements of lack of DMC in people with depression varied greatly according to acuity of illness and whether judgements are structured or unstructured.\nDepression can impair DMC especially if severe. Most evidence indicates appreciation as the ability primarily impaired by depressive illness.

We also explore circadian genetics and psychopathology and the selective pressures on the evolution of clocks.

The DSM-5 has attracted considerable criticism, not least about its role in processes of medicalisation. This paper suggests the need for a sociology of psychiatric critique. Sociological analysis can help map fields of contention, and cast fresh light on the assumptions and nuances of debate around the DSM-5; it underscores the importance of diagnosis to the governance of social and clinical life, as well as the wider discourses critical commentaries connect with and are activated by.

In this paper I examine three important issues that arise from the new manual:(1) Expanding nosology: Psychiatry has again broadened its nosology to include human experiences not previously under its purview (eg, binge eating disorder, internet gaming disorder, caffeine use disorder, hoarding disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder). Consequence-based ethical concerns about this expansion are addressed, along with conceptual concerns about a confusion of \"construct validity\" and \"conceptual validity\" and a failure to distinguish between \"disorder\" and \"non disordered conditions for which we help people.\"(2) The role of claims about societal impact in changes in nosology: Several changes in the DSM-5 involved claims about societal impact in their rationales. This is due in part to a new online open comment period during DSM development. Examples include advancement of science, greater access to treatment, greater public awareness of condition, loss of identify or harm to those with removed disorders, stigmatization, offensiveness, etc. I identify and evaluate four importantly distinct ways in which claims about societal impact might operate in DSM development.

In this article, we discuss the meaning of Ichst\u00f6rung, the role it played in the development of the concept of schizophrenia, and recent research on metacognition that allows for the quantitative study of the link between self-disturbance and outcome in schizophrenia. Phenomenological psychiatrists such as Blankenburg, Binswanger, and Conrad interpreted the Ichst\u00f6rung as disturbed relationship to self and others, thus challenging recent efforts to interpret self-disturbance as diminished pure passive self-affection, which putatively \"explains\" schizophrenia and its various symptoms. Narrative is a reflective, embodied process, which requires a dynamic shifting of perspectives which, when compromised, may reflect disrupted binding of the components of self-experience. The Metacognition Assessment Scale-abbreviated as MAS-A-suggests that persons with schizophrenia tend to produce narratives with reductions in the binding processes required to produce an integrated, embodied self within narrated life stories, and in interactive relationships with others."}, {"Title": "Sexual assault, irresistible impulses, and forensic psychiatry in Sweden.", "Abstract": "After forensic psychiatry was firmly established in Sweden in the 1930s, many rapists and individuals charged with assaulting children underwent a forensic psychiatric examination. The physicians found that most of them had not been \"in control\" of their senses or not \"in complete control\" of their senses at the time of the crime. If the court ordered a forensic psychiatric examination, the defendant had a very good chance of either being discharged or having his sentence reduced considerably. By the 1950s psychological perspectives began to dominate in forensic psychiatry. In the forensic records of the 1950s we can notice a shift from a biomedical to a socio-psychological perspective, and crime was increasingly related to conditions that were not seen as mental derangement from a legal point of view. As a result, it became less and less common, from the 1950s onwards, for sentences to be commuted or defendants discharged."}, {"Title": "Developing zebrafish models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder with complex symptoms and unclear, multi-factorial pathogenesis. Animal (rodent) models of ASD-like behavior are extensively used to study genetics, circuitry and molecular mechanisms of ASD. The evolutionarily conserved nature of social behavior and its molecular pathways suggests that alternative experimental models can be developed to complement and enhance the existing rodent ASD paradigms. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is rapidly becoming a popular model organism in neuroscience and biological psychiatry to study brain function, model human brain disorders and explore their genetic or pharmacological modulation. Representing highly social animals, zebrafish emerge as a strong potential model organism to study normal and pathological social phenotypes, as well as several other ASD-like symptoms. Here, we discuss the developing utility of zebrafish in modeling ASD as a new emerging field in translational neuroscience and drug discovery."}, {"Title": "Paternalism, autonomy and reciprocity: ethical perspectives in encounters with patients in psychiatric in-patient care.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric staff members have the power to decide the options that frame encounters with patients. Intentional as well as unintentional framing can have a crucial impact on patients' opportunities to be heard and participate in the process. We identified three dominant ethical perspectives in the normative medical ethics literature concerning how doctors and other staff members should frame interactions in relation to patients; paternalism, autonomy and reciprocity. The aim of this study was to describe and analyse statements describing real work situations and ethical reflections made by staff members in relation to three central perspectives in medical ethics; paternalism, autonomy and reciprocity.\nAll staff members involved with patients in seven adult psychiatric and six child and adolescent psychiatric clinics were given the opportunity to freely describe ethical considerations in their work by keeping an ethical diary over the course of one week and 173 persons handed in their diaries. Qualitative theory-guided content analysis was used to provide a description of staff encounters with patients and in what way these encounters were consistent with, or contrary to, the three perspectives.\nThe majority of the statements could be attributed to the perspective of paternalism and several to autonomy. Only a few statements could be attributed to reciprocity, most of which concerned staff members acting contrary to the perspective. The result is presented as three perspectives containing eight values.\u2022Paternalism; 1) promoting and restoring the health of the patient, 2) providing good care and 3) assuming responsibility.\u2022Autonomy; 1) respecting the patient's right to self-determination and information, 2) respecting the patient's integrity and 3) protecting human rights.\u2022Reciprocity; 1) involving patients in the planning and implementation of their care and 2) building trust between staff and patients.\nPaternalism clearly appeared to be the dominant perspective among the participants, but there was also awareness of patients' right to autonomy. Despite a normative trend towards reciprocity in psychiatry throughout the Western world, identifying it proved difficult in this study. This should be borne in mind by clinics when considering the need for ethical education, training and supervision."}, {"Title": "Fatal pulmonary thromboembolism after prolonged physical immobilization in hospitalized psychiatric patients.", "Abstract": "Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) may be one of the causes of sudden death in hospitalized psychiatric patients.

Data of those for which the autopsy showed PTE as the immediate cause of death were extracted, and the presence of risk factors for the development of deep vein thrombosis analyzed.\nIn the observed period, out of 4,001 hospitalized psychiatric patients 53 died, and for 18 of them autopsy was required due to sudden death. In five patients, autopsy revealed PTE as a direct and sole cause of death. All the five patients were males, mean age 45.2 years, and during hospitalization all received strong antipsychotics and diazepam. Of the total duration of their hospital stay (mean 8.2 days), they were temporarily immobilized during an average 4.2 days.

Treatment].", "Abstract": "Pain disorders present highly challenging therapeutic problems, owing in part to complex co-morbidities associated with pain disorders, notably including psychiatric disorders characterized by depressed mood or anxiety. Many treatments are employed to treat pain-disorder patients, and most are unsatisfactory. Virtually all analgesic medicines in long-term use provide only partial efficacy and present substantial risks of adverse effects, loss of benefit over time, or dependency and risk of abuse. Commonly employed drugs with analgesic properties include non-opioids (mainly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents [NSAIDs] or acetaminophen), many natural or synthetic opioids (including opiates and phenylpiperidines), some antidepressants (especially those with noradrenergic activity), a few anticonvulsants, skeletal muscle relaxants or topical remedies, and a growing variety of experimental treatments. The major overlap between pain and psychiatric disorders, as well as the currently unsatisfactory state of treatments available for chronic pain syndromes, encourage a comprehensive approach to assessment and clinical management of patients with chronic pain. Many current treatment programs for pain disorder patients offer narrowly specialized and incomplete treatment options. Ideally however, such care should be provided by multi-disciplinary teams with expertise in neurology, general medicine, pain management, physical medicine and rehabilitation, as well as psychiatry. Psychiatrists as well as pain specialists can serve an essential role in leading comprehensive assessment and general management of such complex and challenging patients who are typically only partially responsive to available treatments."}, {"Title": "[Enduring pain I. Nosology and epidemiology].", "Abstract": "Pain disorders are extraordinarily prevalent throughout clinical medicine, and are highly co-morbid with various psychiatric disorders, particularly those including depression or anxiety. Assessment of such patients tends to be based on diagnostic criteria that may not reflect the complexity of the clinical problem and can result in prioritizing somatic aspects of painful syndromes at the expense of psychiatric aspects or, conversely, over-emphasize psychiatric aspects. In the first part of this overview we consider current nosological perspectives and their potential clinical consequences, epidemiological data that underscore the association of comorbid painful and affective or anxious syndromes, and consider the importance of psychiatric assessment and treatment of such patients. The major overlap between pain disorders and psychiatric disorders, as well as the unsatisfactory state of treatments available for chronic pain syndromes, encourage a comprehensive approach to assessing and clinically managing patients with chronic pain. Many programs for pain disorder patients offer narrowly specialized treatment options. To be preferred are multi-disciplinary teams with expertise in internal medicine, neurology, pain management, and rehabilitation, as well as psychology and psychiatry.

The second study discussed the prevalence of abuse history in patients with schizophrenia whether physical or sexual, and its impact on their condition and function. The third paper reported that patients with substance abuse problem show more risky sexual behaviors than normal controls. The fourth study high-lighted the similarities regarding complaints about sleep and polysomnographic changes in depression patients and somatoform disorder patients. The fifth paper, investigated the prenatal and perinatal risk factors in autistic disorders.

These emotions have been grossly ignored by psychiatry. The two sciences that I shall employ to demonstrate this definition of spirituality will be ethology and neuroscience. They are both very new. I will argue that spirituality is not about ideas, sacred texts and theology. Rather, spirituality is all about emotion and social connection that are more dependent on the limbic system than the cortex. Specific religions, for all their limitations, are often the portal through which positive emotions are brought into conscious attention. Neither Freud nor psychiatric textbooks ever mention emotions like joy and gratitude. Hymns and psalms give these emotions pride of place. Our whole concept of psychotherapy might change, if clinicians set about enhancing positive emotions, rather than focusing only on the negative ones."}, {"Title": "Seroprevalence of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C in substance dependents admitted in a tertiary hospital at Amritsar, India.", "Abstract": "Substance dependents often seek help for deaddiction and are detected positive during routine viral markers testing.

These were some of the questions that were addressed in this study.\nSatisfaction about supervision among 47 post-graduate psychiatry residents in the academic year 2009-2010 was studied. A checklist was constructed to assess satisfaction in areas of educational supervision, clinical supervision and personal/research supervision. Two sets of questions were used - one with a likert scale and the other with a true/false rating.\nPsychiatry residents were satisfied with most areas of supervision. Clinical supervision was superior to educational (including research) and personal supervision. Educational supervision was reported to be satisfactory, however, supervision during external postings, examination clinics and related to development of specific areas of interest, was inadequate. Low levels of satisfaction were reported with supervision regarding psychosocial management. In personal supervision, the areas of need identified were: (1) Involvement of residents in leisure activities, (2) Social and administrative skills and (3) Help in liaison with other disciplines.\nPsychiatry residents in India were satisfied with most areas of supervision even though it is informal and as-usual (i.e. done on a need based way) in most settings.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pramipexole augmentation in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. J. Clin. Psychiatry 74(7), e636-e641 (2013). To overcome limited efficacy in antidepressants, clinicians may choose augmentation, switching to a different antidepressant, or a combination of different antidepressant drugs based on the individual patient's clinical circumstances. Among such options for difficult-to-treat major depressive disorder (MDD) patients, augmentation therapy with atypical antipsychotics, psychostimulants, dopamine agonists, serotonin 1A partial agonists, lithium, and thyroid hormones are commonly used in clinical practice. In fact, augmentation therapy has some clinical merits and is more convenient than switching medications and combination approaches for treating MDD. One such augmentation agent, pramipexole has been proposed, and has been implicated in the development and treatment of MDD. Recently, randomized controlled trials with pramipexole augmentation have been conducted and have demonstrated that pramipexole is a safe and potentially efficacious augmentation strategy.

Western medical knowledge or biomedicine, and by extension science or scientific knowledge, however, has until relatively recently been exempt from anthropological scrutiny in political terms. An understanding of biomedicine as a system of knowledge that is not a copy of facts but a representation of them has entailed a break with the traditional separation of folk knowledge and scientific knowledge in anthropology, making it possible to include biomedicine in the repertoire of ethnographic objects. The peculiarity of biomedicine as a cultural system, seen from this perspective, lies in a paradox: its self-characterization as a set of non-ideological discourses and practices is a representation that conceals its ideological and power-saturated nature. Through an analysis of DSM-IV-TR, this article explores some of the representational strategies through which this concealment takes place in biomedical psychiatry: the asocial and universal character of mental illness categories; the neutrality of clinical practice; and the non-moral nature of clinical criteria and judgment. These are concealed metaphors in the true sense, for not only do they speak of something without naming it but they also deny their own existence as metaphors."}, {"Title": "Medication non-adherence among adult psychiatric out patients in Jimma University Specialized Hospital, Southwest Ethiopia.", "Abstract": "Information on adherence of adult psychiatric patients to biological modes of treatment is scarce in Ethiopia.

First they were seen as one form of the unitary psychosis, later they became involved in the dispute about the concept of paranoia. The first German definition, proposed by Carl Westphal in 1877 and of crucial importance in the conceptual history of obsessive disorders as an illness (OCD) ever since, stood in this tradition. Still the adequate nosological classification of obsessive phenomena was still heavily disputed. As more and more varied forms of obsessive disorders were described, the highly unspecific concept of neurasthenia gained importance. Then degeneration theory was a widespread aetiological concept to integrate the large number of obsessive phenomena. Towards the end of the 19th century, when psychoanalysis emerged, psychological aspects started to interest psychiatrists and psychoanalytical suggestions like Sigmund Freud's concept of obsessional neurosis were discussed. However, none of these different nosological suggestions, nor any of the proposed definitions, found general approval. Above all the question to what extent affects were involved and whether certain phenomena were compulsive in nature or not remained the subject of (ongoing) controversy. This led to a variety of highly inconsistent aetiopathogenetic concepts being proposed."}, {"Title": "Drug-induced long QT in adult psychiatric inpatients: the 5-year cross-sectional ECG Screening Outcome in Psychiatry study.", "Abstract": "The authors aimed to determine the prevalence of drug-induced long QT at admission to a public psychiatric hospital and to document the associated factors using a cross-sectional approach.\nAll ECG recordings over a 5-year period were reviewed for drug-induced long QT (heart-rate corrected QT \u2265500 ms and certain or probable drug imputability) and associated conditions.

It describes how the concept derives from Kraepelin, but was lost with DSM-III, which divided the broad manic-depressive illness concept, based on recurrent mood episodes of either polarity, to the bipolar versus unipolar dichotomy, based on allowing non-recurrent mood episodes of only one polarity. This approach followed the views of Karl Leonhard and other critics of Kraepelin. Thus post DSM-III American psychiatry is not neo-Kraepelinian, as many claim, but neo-Leonhardian. The bipolar spectrum approach, as advocated by Akiskal and Koukopoulos first, harkens back to the original broad Kraepelinian view of manic-depressive illness.

A letter to a 21st century psychiatry resident.", "Abstract": "During the development of the DSM-5, even the lay press questioned psychiatr's scientific validity. This review provides 21st century psychiatry residents with ways of answering these attacks by defining the concepts and history of psychiatry (a branch of medicine), medicine and science. Psychiatric language has two levels: first, describing symptoms and signs (19th century descriptive psychopathology developed in France and Germany), and second, describing disorders (psychiatric nosology was developed in the early 20th century by Kraepelin and resuscitated by the US neo-Kraepelinian revolution leading to the DSM-III). Science is a complex trial-and-error historical process that can be threatened by those who believe too much in it and disregard its limitations. The most important psychiatric advances, electroconvulsive therapy and major psychopharmacological agents, were discovered by \"chance\", not by scientific planning. Jaspers's General Psychopathology is a complex 100-year-old book that describes: 1) psychiatric disorders as heterogeneous and 2) psychiatry as a hybrid scientific discipline requiring a combination of understanding (a social science method) and explanation (a natural science method). In the 21st century Berrios reminds us of psychiatry's unfortunate methodological issues due to hybrid symptoms and disorders, some of which are better understood as problems in communication between interacting human beings; in those situations neuroscience methods such as brain imaging make no sense.

A direct and immediate intensive caring and therapeutic supervision, also known as special observation is still recommended in guidelines (DGPPN, 2012) and maybe one of the most used interventions in the caring of suicidal patients in inpatient settings. It involves many kinds to develop the relationship between the observer and the patient. The original SPOC was developed in Sweden with the aim to increase the quality of a systematically documentation during the supervision of suicidal patients. It is an instrument to ensure systematic documentation of observational behavior or noticeable mood during acute suicidal crisis, for example feelings like \"worried, anxious\" or other possible influencing factors like \"sudden mood variation\". By this means the SPOC can ensure the process of systematic documentation of special observation and increase its quality, i. e. who documented what at what time. Furthermore SPOC can facilitate a better communication of the observation process to the multidisciplinary team and to the patient as well. The SPOC includes the 28 items and covers 24 separate observation periods. The aim of this paper is to constitute the translation process from the English to the German SPOC version. The translation process followed a five step model. In the first step the English version was translated from two German native speakers. In the second step, the first two translation results where discussed by the Expert group (authors) and a new version was developed. In the third step the first german version was translated back (two English native Speakers) into English. The fourth step was taken, to review the results by the expert groups (authors) and set up the so called \"pre version\". The last step includes the proof of content validity by 52 nurses. The proof was able to identify a few misunderstandings and helped to enhance the tool in its final version. With the translation, the German-speaking nursing practice in psychiatry has a tool that can be used by psychiatric nurses regarding their complex interventions to be undertaken in this special group of patients."}, {"Title": "Neurology in the German training system for psychiatrists - a personal view.", "Abstract": "In mid-19th-century Germany the conviction that 'mental disease is brain disease' was accompanied by a call for social reform in psychiatry.

Fueled by straightforward data collection, R-FMRI analysis methods as well as studies reporting on R-FMRI have flourished, and already impact research on child- and adolescent psychiatric disorders. Here, we review R-FMRI analysis techniques and outline current methodological debates. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the main R-FMRI findings related to child- and adolescent psychiatric disorders. R-FMRI research has contributed significantly to our understanding of brain function in child and adolescent psychiatry: existing hypotheses based on task-based FMRI were confirmed and new insights into the brain's functional architecture of disorders were established. However, results were not always consistent. While resting state networks are robust and reproducible, neuroimaging research in psychiatric disorders is especially complicated by tremendous phenotypic heterogeneity. It is imperative that we overcome this heterogeneity when integrating neuroimaging into the diagnostic and treatment process. As R-FMRI allows investigating the richness of the human functional connectome and can be easily collected and aggregated into large-scale datasets, it is clear that R-FMRI can be a powerful tool in our quest to understand psychiatric pathology."}, {"Title": "The complexity of globus: a multidisciplinary perspective.", "Abstract": "Globus is a topic of interest for many specialties including otorhinolaryngology, gastroenterology and psychiatry/psychosomatic medicine, but, although many hypotheses have been suggested, key questions about its aetiology remain. This Review provides an overview of the extensive literature concerning this topic and discusses the quality of the evidence to date. Globus has been associated with oropharyngeal structural lesions, upper oesophageal sphincter disorders, oesophageal disorders, GERD, psychosocial factors and psychiatric comorbidity. However, findings are often contradictory and the literature remains highly inconclusive. Indeed, with the exception of patients with structural-based globus, the Rome III criteria for functional globus only apply to a subgroup of patients with idiopathic globus. In clinical reality, there exists a group of patients who present with idiopathic (nonstructural) globus, but nevertheless have dysphagia, odynophagia or GERD-exclusion criteria for globus diagnosis according to Rome III. The symptomatology of patients with globus might be broader than previously thought. It is therefore crucial to approach globus not from one single perspective, but from a multifactorial point of view, with focus on the coexistence and/or interactions of different mechanisms in globus pathogenesis. This approach could be translated to clinical practice by adopting a multidisciplinary method to patients presenting with globus."}, {"Title": "NEUROBIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF SUICIDE AND SUICIDE ATTEMPTS IN BIPOLAR DISORDER.", "Abstract": "Suicide and bipolar disorder (BD) are challenging, complex, and intertwined areas of study in contemporary psychiatry. Indeed, BD is associated with the highest lifetime risk for suicide attempt and completion of all the psychiatric conditions. Given that several clinical risk factors for both suicide and BD have been well noted in the literature, exploring the neurobiological aspects of suicide in BD may provide insights into both preventive measures and future novel treatments. This review synthesizes findings regarding the neurobiological aspects of suicide and, when applicable, their link to BD. Neurochemical findings, genes/epigenetics, and potential molecular targets for current or future treatments are discussed. The role of endophenotypes and related proximal and distal risk factors underlying suicidal behavior are also explored. Lastly, we discuss the manner in which preclinical work on aggression and impulsivity may provide additional insights for the future development of novel treatments."}, {"Title": "Study of effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on stages of sexual function in Iranian patients with major depressive disorder.", "Abstract": "Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders in the world. Lifetime prevalence is 15% among men and 25% among women. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants are often used for depression, with their own side effects. This study was carried out since little information on sexual dysfunction due to these medications is available in Iran.\nThis observational cross-sectional study included 100 patients attending a university or private psychiatry clinic who, after an interview based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition criteria, were considered depressed. These patients had no history of depression, sexual dysfunction or use of psychiatric medications. Sexual functioning of patients was evaluated at the start of the study, and after 2, 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Data were evaluated using SPSS software and t and \u03c7(2) tests.\nA total of 75% of patients reported sexual dysfunction: 66.7% of men and 79.7% of women. A total of 74.1% of patients on fluvoxamine, 100% on fluoxetine, 75% on sertraline, 71.4% on citalopram and 100% on paroxetine reported sexual dysfunction. The most frequent sexual dysfunction was difficulty with orgasm, which affected 41.17% of women and 33.33% of men.\nThe incidence of sexual dysfunction among users of SSRIs was highest in patients on fluvoxamine, but this was not statistically significant.

Although it has several disadvantages (e.g., relatively low spatial resolution and the possibility of shallow coverage in the depth of brain regions) compared with other functional neuroimaging techniques (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography), fNIRS may be a candidate instrument for clinical use in psychiatry, as it can measure brain activity in naturalistic position easily and non-invasively. fNIRS instruments are also small and work silently, and can be moved almost everywhere including schools and care units. Previous fNIRS studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia have impaired activity and characteristic waveform patterns in the prefrontal cortex during the letter version of the verbal fluency task, and part of these results have been approved as one of the Advanced Medical Technologies as an aid for the differential diagnosis of depressive symptoms by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan in 2009, which was the first such approval in the field of psychiatry. Moreover, previous studies suggest that the activity in the frontopolar prefrontal cortex is associated with their functions in chronic schizophrenia and is its next candidate biomarker. Future studies aimed at exploring fNIRS differences in various clinical stages, longitudinal changes, drug effects, and variations during different task paradigms will be needed to develop more accurate biomarkers that can be used to aid differential diagnosis, the comprehension of the present condition, the prediction of outcome, and the decision regarding treatment options in schizophrenia.

A German physician EOE von Balz devoted himself to educating medicine at Tokyo Medical School, the predecessor of the present University of Tokyo for 25 years. Hiroshi Kawahara and Kinnosuke Miura, pioneers of Japan Neurology, received their education by him. Kawahara first described X-linked bulvo-spinal muscular atrophy, and published the first Japanese textbook of clinical neurology in 1897.

Questionnaires were distributed prior to commencement of their attachment and redistributed on the final day of the attachment.\nOf the 165 participants in the study, 75 students entered medicine via the traditional route (without a primary degree), 49 entered via the graduate entry programme and 41 had a primary degree. Overall, medical students displayed positive attitudes towards psychiatry. However, while there was an improvement in attitudes towards psychiatry and the career attractiveness of psychiatry on completion of the rotation, no differences were found between graduate and non-graduate entry students. Psychiatry and general practice had lower ratings for career attractiveness than other specialities. No significant changes were found in the first and second choice of specialty.\nOur results show that improvements in attitude and career attractiveness do not necessarily correlate with increased choice of psychiatry as a specialty.

Work-related stress is a major problem for mental health. The occupational physician has the opportunity to gather information on the perception of stress from workers in the course of regular medical examinations. Method. 1,231 subjects, engaged in 6 different occupations, were invited to compile the Demand/Control/Support and the Effort/Reward/Imbalance questionnaires. Results. A specific profile of work-related stress emerged for each group of workers. Radiology physicians reported high control over work, but also exceedingly high demand and effort, high overcommitment, low social support, and low rewards from work. Health care workers were often overcommitted but had high levels of reward and social support. Low levels of social support and reward were recorded for mature workers, while special force policemen engaged in law enforcement during the G8 meeting had high levels of social support and regards, so that their resulting stress levels were closer to the reference group of employees in an insurance company with no front-office.

It looks at his account of mental disturbance, how he responded to the psychiatric profession and how he reacted to being diagnosed as insane. It considers his autobiographical novella of madness, Aurelia, which he began at the suggestion of his alienist, Dr Emile Blanche, and while he was still an asylum inmate. Nerval's story raises important questions about the nature of madness. Is it, as he contended, a mystical experience revealing truths about spiritual worlds inaccessible to the 'sane'? Does psychiatry fail to understand it and inappropriately reduce it to the categories of scientific reason? Or are such notions of the spiritual value of madness guilty of the charge that they romanticise insanity? Do they make extravagant claims for an experience that is often disturbing and debilitating? What is the relationship between madness and recovery? Should an individual try to forget their experience of mental disturbance once they recover, or should they examine what the event reveals about themselves? Can the language of madness be decoded to unveil profound truths as Carl Jung and R.D. Laing have suggested, or is it, as the psychiatrist German Berrios maintains, merely a series of 'empty speech acts', signifying nothing? And finally, how does one avoid writing about madness, and instead write madness?"}, {"Title": "Transfer of care of psychotherapy patients: implications for psychiatry training.", "Abstract": "Transfers of care occur routinely in medical training, but the transfer of psychotherapy patients has received relatively little attention. This article discusses important issues concerning these transfers, using case examples and findings from a survey of the experience of psychiatry residents transitioning psychotherapy patients. Residents have difficulty telling patients they are leaving and often delay doing so. Because feelings of closeness and attachment can develop in long-term therapeutic relationships, residents describe feeling guilty, uncertain, anxious, sad, and occasionally relieved as they prepare their patients for transfer. Outgoing residents can feel anxious when recognizing and addressing their patients' and their own positive feelings. Incoming residents experience discomfort at being compared to the previous therapist and often encounter the patient's negative feelings at the transfer and the loss of the previous therapy. Teaching about the two poles of transfer of care is recommended to better understand and respond to this transition for both patient and therapist. This should include addressing the stresses involved and recommendations for management."}, {"Title": "Adjuvant therapy with minocycline for schizophrenia (The MINOS Trial): study protocol for a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is understood to be a heterogeneous brain condition with overlapping symptom dimensions.

This association was not reduced after adjustment for socio-economic status, family history of schizophrenia, maternal education or birth weight but after adjustment for maternal anxiety and depression and smoking in early pregnancy there was no longer any evidence for an association (OR 1.01 95% CI 0.93-1.10).\nThis study provides some evidence to suggest that stressful life events may affect child psychotic experiences through effects on maternal psychopathology, and possibly physiology, during pregnancy."}, {"Title": "A multicentre randomised controlled trial of a carer supervised culturally adapted CBT (CaCBT) based self-help for depression in Pakistan.", "Abstract": "Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) based self-help has been found to be effective for treating depression and anxiety. There is some evidence to suggest that CBT needs to be culturally adapted for it to be effective in non-Western cultures. CBT is not widely used in low and middle income countries and there is a need to test its effectiveness in different settings and formats, including self-help.\nWe describe a RCT of a Culturally adapted CBT (CaCBT) based self-help manual in Pakistan. The trial was conducted in psychiatry departments in three cities. Assessments were carried out at baseline and at 12 weeks, using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Bradford somatic Inventory and brief disability Questionnaire.\nAt the end of the trial CaCBT based self-help was found to be effective against care as usual in reducing the symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as somatic symptoms and disability.\nThis study was conducted only in secondary care and required either patient or a carer to be able to read and write.\nThis is the first study outside West of a CBT based self-help intervention for depression.

Intensive research efforts for specific and sensitive biological markers, or biomarkers, for psychopathology as objective alternatives to the current paradigm are ongoing. While biomarker research in psychiatry has focused largely on functional neuroimaging methods for identifying the neural functions that associate with psychopathology, scalp electroencephalography (EEG) has been viewed, historically, as offering little specific brain source information, as scalp appearance is only loosely correlated to its brain source dynamics. However, ongoing advances in signal processing of EEG data can now deliver functional EEG brain-imaging with distinctly improved spatial, as well as fine temporal, resolution. One computational approach proving particularly useful for EEG cortical brain imaging is independent component analysis (ICA). ICA decomposition can be used to identify distinct cortical source activities that are sensitive and specific to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Given its practical research advantages, relatively low cost, and ease of use, EEG-imaging is now both feasible and attractive, in particular for studies involving the large samples required by genetically informative designs to characterize causal pathways to psychopathology. The completely non-invasive nature of EEG data acquisition, coupled with ongoing advances in dry, wireless, and wearable EEG technology, makes EEG-imaging increasingly attractive and appropriate for psychiatric research, including the study of developmentally young samples. Applied to large genetically and developmentally informative samples, EEG imaging can advance the search for robust diagnostic biomarkers and phenotypes in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Single-subject anxiety treatment outcome prediction using functional neuroimaging.", "Abstract": "The possibility of individualized treatment prediction has profound implications for the development of personalized interventions for patients with anxiety disorders. Here we utilize random forest classification and pre-treatment functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD) to generate individual subject treatment outcome predictions. Before cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), 48 adults (25 GAD and 23 PD) reduced (via cognitive reappraisal) or maintained their emotional responses to negative images during fMRI scanning. CBT responder status was predicted using activations from 70 anatomically defined regions. The final random forest model included 10 predictors contributing most to classification accuracy. A similar analysis was conducted using the clinical and demographic variables. Activations in the hippocampus during maintenance and anterior insula, superior temporal, supramarginal, and superior frontal gyri during reappraisal were among the best predictors, with greater activation in responders than non-responders. The final fMRI-based model yielded 79% accuracy, with good sensitivity (0.86), specificity (0.68), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (2.73, 0.20). Clinical and demographic variables yielded poorer accuracy (69%), sensitivity (0.79), specificity (0.53), and likelihood ratios (1.67, 0.39). This is the first use of random forest models to predict treatment outcome from pre-treatment neuroimaging data in psychiatry. Together, random forest models and fMRI can provide single-subject predictions with good test characteristics. Moreover, activation patterns are consistent with the notion that greater activation in cortico-limbic circuitry predicts better CBT response in GAD and PD."}, {"Title": "Depression and ways of coping with stress: a preliminary study.", "Abstract": "Coping with stress is defined as all activities undertaken by a human in a stressful situation. The effect of stress on depression, its role in triggering the subsequent phases of the disease, and the factors that mediate the stress-depression relationship become more and more often subjects of research in psychiatry and psychology. Factors important for the formation of depressive symptoms and disease progression are significantly associated with coping strategies used in the face of stress. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the most popular strategies of coping with stress in people with depression in comparison to healthy subjects.\nInitial research was carried on 80 patients aged from 20 to 66 years with a diagnosis of depression. The control group consisted of 30 healthy subjects aged 22 to 57 years. Analysis of the most popular strategies of coping with stress was performed with the Multiphasic Inventory for Measuring Coping (COPE) by Carver, Scheier, and Weintraub.\nIn contrast with healthy people, patients with depression in stressful situations more often use strategies based on avoidance and denial and have more difficulties in finding positive aspects of stressful events.\nDepression may be an important factor in the negative assessment of one's own ability to cope with difficult situations and can aggravate a tendency to perceive stressful events as overwhelming."}, {"Title": "Assessing for unique immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles of physical activity subtypes: a focus on psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Physical activity (PA) is emerging as a safe and effective tool in the prevention and treatment of psychiatric disorders. PA subtypes include aerobic, resistance, flexibility, neuromotor (involving balance, agility and co-ordination), mind-body (e.g. tai chi, qi gong and yoga) and mixed type trainings. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that PA subtypes can have positive clinical effects, however the effects on the symptomatology may vary according to the PA subtype. It therefore stands to reason that various PA subtypes may modulate the immune system and neuroplastic processes differently. This systematic review aims to assess the immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles of various PA subtypes, particularly in unipolar depression and age-related cognitive decline (ARCD). The literature suggests several unique immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles for PA subtypes (i.e. resistance, aerobic and mind-body) in depression and ARCD. In depression, levels of various cytokines at baseline may predict treatment response to subtypes of PA and pharmacological agents. The pro-neuroplastic effects of resistance and aerobic PA in ARCD may differ due to variances in neurotrophin profiles. At this stage of literature in the field, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the specific immunomodulatory and neuroplastic pathways involved in these PA subtypes given of the small number of comparative studies and methodological heterogeneity between studies (e.g. study population age and illness severity, as well as duration and intensity of PA intervention). This important field requires well-designed, high-quality comparative studies to better describe unique immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles."}, {"Title": "Involuntary outpatient treatment in patients with severe mental illness: a one-year follow-up study.", "Abstract": "Involuntary outpatient treatment (IOT) aims to ensure adherence to therapy in patients with serious mental disease who are unaware of their illness and for whom treatment discontinuation carries a high risk of relapse.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of IOT in preventing relapse among patients with serious mental disease.\nA retrospective observational study was carried out on all of the patients (n=140) receiving IOT in the city of Valencia, Spain.

Although proposals have met with some support, there have also been detractors. The history of fitness to plead is reviewed and current case law (including the 1836 Pritchard criteria) is examined. Although existing arrangements have been criticised, this may be attributable to inconsistent practical application, rather than inherent conceptual flaws. The Pritchard test has largely stood the test of time and has emerged relatively unscathed. Fitness to plead is not a medical construct, but rather a legal entity and any new test would be likely to introduce its own difficulties. A capacity based assessment could enhance debate and disagreement and increase court time in many cases, presenting new resource implications with questionable benefit. As the existing Pritchard criteria, amended by case law, already include a five limb test that closely resembles a capacity assessment (ability to plead to the indictment, to understand the course of the proceedings, to instruct a lawyer, to challenge a juror and to understand the evidence) and given the difficulties in introducing a functional test format in other jurisdictions, the Law Commission's proposals should now be set aside, perhaps for another day: reconsideration may be possible some decades hence, pending enhanced scientific developments within psychiatry and better understanding of the mind."}, {"Title": "Obtaining subjects' consent to publish identifying personal information: current practices and identifying potential issues.", "Abstract": "In studies publishing identifying personal information, obtaining consent is regarded as necessary, as it is impossible to ensure complete anonymity.

Two journals mentioned that the possible effects of publication on subjects should be considered. Many journal consent forms mentioned the difficulties in ensuring complete anonymity of subjects, but few addressed the study objective, the subjects' right to refuse consent and the withdrawal of consent. The main reason for requiring the submission of consent forms was to confirm that consent had been obtained.\nApproximately 40% of journals required subject consent to be obtained.

To our knowledge, this is the first time an HPS has been used for skills training in psychiatry.\nNineteen psychiatry residents participated in this randomized controlled trial to compare traditional training (n = 9) versus training using an HPS (n = 10). Two blinded raters assessed performance using a newly developed checklist and global rating scale for this task (ECT-OSATS) (Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills). Residents also completed a pretest-posttest knowledge test and confidence survey.\nResidents in the HPS group performed significantly better in terms of ECT-OSATS when compared with the control group (P < 0.001). All 10 of the HPS group received a \"pass\" rating following training, whereas only 1 of the 9 control group received a \"pass\" rating. There were no significant group differences in posttest confidence (P = 0.21) or total knowledge gain scores from pretest to posttest (P = 0.36).\nThe level of clinical skill acquired by trainees in psychiatry for performing ECT is significantly superior using HPS- based training, in contrast to the domains of knowledge and confidence, which appear to be equally imparted using either training modality.

Based on means and standard deviations for a continuous outcome, we examined the performance of an imputation method to define a dichotomous outcome using original individual patients' data from 16 randomized trials (6276 participants) comparing antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia. We concluded that the imputed values re-captured in a reasonable degree the observed values providing a simple and practical alternative methodological choice for imputation of missing binary data in schizophrenia trials; nevertheless, the imputation method tended to introduce biases, especially for extreme risks and large treatment differences."}, {"Title": "Predictors of distress associated with psychotic-like anomalous experiences in clinical and non-clinical populations.", "Abstract": "Psychotic-like anomalous experiences are not inherently distressing, nor do they inevitably lead to clinical conditions.

A series of ordinal logistic regression analyses was conducted to investigate which variables predicted anomaly-related distress.\nPredictors of higher distress were anomalous states characterized by changes in awareness and cognitive functioning (rather than more typical positive symptoms), appraisals of experiences as caused by 'other people', and greater attempted control over experiences. Predictors of lower distress were 'spiritual' appraisals, greater perceived social support/understanding, greater perceived controllability, and reacting with a 'neutral response'.\nWhile psychotic-like experiences themselves are not necessarily distressing, appraisals and responses to anomalies do predict distress, as do factors relating to the social context.

When detected, antidepressant treatment begins promptly. In contrast to this rescue approach, prophylactic antidepressant treatment has been considered as a superior approach. While studies indicate that depression is lower with prophylaxis, no study has prospectively evaluated the degree that treatment completion might be boosted by the prophylactic strategy. A structured literature search was conducted to discover all trials of antidepressant prophylaxis for patients undergoing antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis C. Selection criteria included: antidepressant prophylaxis study; report of depression treatment outcome; report of numbers discontinuing and reason for discontinuation (including any of the following: discontinuation data for medical side effects (i.e., thrombocytopenia); discontinuation due to lack of antiviral response; discontinuation due to lack of antidepressant effect; discontinuation due to antidepressant side effects; discontinuation due to patient preference; discontinuation due to loss to follow-up; or unspecified discontinuation). Across the studies, total enrollees were determined for the prophylaxis arms and the rescue arms, and then, again across studies, those discontinuing for reasons other than lack of antiviral response or medical side effect were summed for each of these two arms. Twelve studies were discovered. One was a retrospective chart review, one was an uncontrolled trial, and ten were controlled trials. Discontinuation of antiviral therapy was not less common in the prophylaxis arms: of the 396 patients treated by the prophylaxis strategy, 47 (11.9%) discontinued; of the 380 patients in the rescue strategy, 45 (11.8%) discontinued.

However, the occurrence of non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage as a manifestation of cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome post-carotid endarterectomy is uncommon. We report a case of a patient who presented with headache following carotid endarterectomy for a critically occluded common carotid artery.

Non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a rare post-operative complication of carotid endarterectomy. Immediate management with aggressive blood pressure control is key to prevent permanent neurological deficits. Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) after carotid revascularization procedures is an uncommon and potentially fatal complication.

These original sources provide new insights into the organisational background of the International Symposium on Psychiatric Rehabilitation of 1963, as a result of which the groundbreaking Rodewisch Propositions were framed. The documents founds reveal that, apart from the persons already identified, Halle/Saale - based hygienist Karlheinz Renker was deeply involved in the preparation of this event. They also show that for ideological reasons the GDR Ministry of Health restricted the number of participants from non-socialist countries, in particular Western Germany, to be admitted. Finally, the sources suggest that a volume compiling all talks given at the symposium as one publication and as such making its content and resolutions known to a wider public failed, among other reasons, due to the fact that Karl Leonhard, then head of the GDR Association for Psychiatry and Neurology, was \"not interested\" in it."}, {"Title": "Time for training in psychiatric ethics.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry is often fraught with uncertainties and complex situations which give rise to particular ethical issues.

The Board of the Pacific Rim College of Psychiatrists identified experts in forensic psychiatry from Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, and the US. Each contributor provided an account of issues in their jurisdiction, including mental health services to mentally disordered offenders in prison, competence or fitness to stand trial, legal insanity as a defense at trial, diminished responsibility, and special forensic services available, including forensic hospitals and community forensic mental health services. Responses have been collated and are presented topic by topic and country by country within the body of this review. The availability of mental health screening and psychiatric in-reach or forensic liaison services within prisons differed considerably between countries, as did provisioning of community forensic mental health and rehabilitation services. Diversion of mentally disordered offenders to forensic, state, or hybrid hospitals was common. Legal constructs of criminal responsibility (insanity defense) and fitness to stand trial (\"disability\") are almost universally recognized, although variably used.

They play an important role within psychiatric symptoms and disorders. On the one hand they may appear as a symptom of a disorder, which may also be a diagnostic criterion, as for example in affective disorders, on the other hand they may be independent disorders or last but not least sequelae of psychiatric disorders or their pharmacological therapy, as with antidepressants or neuroleptics, which may cause or deteriorate nocturnal movement disorders. They may aggravate psychiatric disorders, perpetuate them or predict a disease onset, like in depressive or manic episodes. Also in organic sleep disorders, such as sleep-related breathing disorders or nocturnal movement disorders, increased anxiety or depression scores may be observed. Patients suffering from sleep disorders do not only experience impaired well-being, but also show deteriorations in cognition and performance, have a higher risk of accidents, are generally more prone to health problems, have a higher sickness absence rate, seek medical help more often and thus are also an important socioeconomic factor.

Inevitably, revisions of the diagnostic manuals, the International Classification of Diseases and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), provide an occasion for renewed criticism, and the revision process of the DSM-IV became a focus for further debates on overdiagnosis. The debates are typically not about the presence or absence of a decisive marker of specific illnesses or of illness in general-a complex matter on which there is hardly a consensus-but rather about the relative medical, psychosocial, and financial harms and benefits that may accrue from overdiagnosis on the one side and underdiagnosis on the other. It is proposed in this In Review paper that a useful and valid principle for use in these debates is the tight conceptual linkage between illness and distress and impairment of day-to-day functioning. This linkage is fundamental to the conceptualization of mental disorder in the DSM-IV and can still serve to reduce overdiagnosis by excluding cases where distress and impairment are absent or minimal. The same conceptual linkage provides a way of understanding how conditions may warrant a diagnosis even though they are not associated with current distress or impairment, namely, if they carry risk for such in the future. For these conditions, assessments of costs and benefits of overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis depend crucially on high-quality, replicated data on the sensitivity and specificity of the early diagnostic test."}, {"Title": "Avoiding false positives: zones of rarity, the threshold problem, and the DSM clinical significance criterion.", "Abstract": "False positives arise when people without disorders are diagnosed as having disorders. Various approaches for avoiding false positives have been suggested. This review critically assesses the roles of zones of rarity, the threshold problem (the problem of determining the boundary of disorder in cases that shade into normality), and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criterion that requires that a disorder cause clinically significant impairment or distress (the harm criterion). The lack of zones of rarity in much of psychiatry gives rise to the threshold problem. The DSM harm criterion is frequently presented as offering a solution to the threshold problem. However, I argue that the harm criterion cannot offer a general solution to the threshold problem, as harm is not always correlated with the intensity and frequency of symptoms. Still, the harm criterion is essential to ensure that people who are merely different are not diagnosed as having a disorder. The threshold problem can be addressed by selecting symptom-based cut-off points to distinguish between disorder and normality. These cut-off points are frequently arbitrary in the sense that they often reflect no natural division between disorder and normal, but they may be more or less wisely chosen. Where possible, the thresholds should be set so that the advantages of diagnosis can be expected to outweigh the disadvantages."}, {"Title": "The place of words and numbers in psychiatric research.", "Abstract": "In recent decades, there has been widespread debate in the human and social sciences regarding the compatibility and the relative merits of quantitative and qualitative approaches in research. In psychiatry, depending on disciplines and traditions, objects of study can be represented either in words or using two types of mathematization. In the latter case, the use of mathematics in psychiatry is most often only local, as opposed to global as in the case of classical mechanics. Relationships between these objects of study can in turn be explored in three different ways: 1/ by a hermeneutic process, 2/ using statistics, the most frequent method in psychiatric research today, 3/ using equations, i.e. using mathematical relationships that are formal and deterministic. The 3 ways of representing entities (with language, locally with mathematics or globally with mathematics) and the 3 ways of expressing the relationships between entities (using hermeneutics, statistics or equations) can be combined in a cross-tabulation, and nearly all nine combinations can be described using examples. A typology of this nature may be useful in assessing which epistemological perspectives are currently dominant in a constantly evolving field such as psychiatry, and which other perspectives still need to be developed. It also contributes to undermining the overly simplistic and counterproductive beliefs that accompany the assumption of a Manichean \"quantitative/qualitative\" dichotomy. Systematic examination of this set of typologies could be useful in indicating new directions for future research beyond the quantitative/qualitative divide."}, {"Title": "MAP as a model for practice-based learning and improvement in child psychiatry training.", "Abstract": "Not only is there a growing literature demonstrating the positive outcomes that result from implementing evidence based treatments (EBTs) but also studies that suggest a lack of delivery of these EBTs in \"usual care\" practices. One way to address this deficit is to improve the quality of psychotherapy teaching for clinicians-in-training. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requires all training programs to assess residents in a number of competencies including Practice-Based Learning and Improvements (PBLI). This article describes the piloting of Managing and Adapting Practice (MAP) for child psychiatry fellows, to teach them both EBT and PBLI skills. Eight child psychiatry trainees received 5 full days of MAP training and are delivering MAP in a year-long outpatient teaching clinic. In this setting, MAP is applied to the complex, multiply diagnosed psychiatric patients that present to this clinic. This article describes how MAP tools and resources assist in teaching trainees each of the eight required competency components of PBLI, including identifying deficits in expertise, setting learning goals, performing learning activities, conducting quality improvement methods in practice, incorporating formative feedback, using scientific studies to inform practice, using technology for learning, and participating in patient education.

Building on murine studies, a series of papers appeared recently showing that therapeutic irradiation of the ipsilateral subventricular zone (SVZ) retards growth of more peripherally growing cortical glioblastomas in humans, suggesting a tumor trophic function for the SVZ. Further studies showed that SVZ cells migrate out towards a peripheral glioblastoma. Dopamine signaling through D3 subtype receptor indirectly drives this centrifugal migration in humans. Since psychiatry has several drugs with good D3 blocking attributes, such as fluphenazine, or perphenazine, we suggest that adding one of these D3 blocking drugs to current standard treatment of resection followed by temozolomide and irradiation might prolong survival by depriving glioblastoma of the trophic functions previously subserved by dopaminergic signaling on SVZ cells."}, {"Title": "When psychiatric diagnosis becomes an overworked tool.", "Abstract": "A psychiatric diagnosis today is asked to serve many functions-clinical, research, medicolegal, delimiting insurance coverage, service planning, defining eligibility for state benefits (eg, for unemployment or disability), as well as providing rallying points for pressure groups and charities. These contexts require different notions of diagnosis to tackle the particular problem such a designation is meant to solve. In a number of instances, a 'status' definition (ie, a diagnostic label or category) is employed to tackle what is more appropriately seen as requiring a 'functional' approach (ie, how well the person is able to meet the demands of a test of performance requiring certain capabilities, aptitudes or skills). In these instances, a diagnosis may play only a subsidiary role. Some examples are discussed: the criteria for involuntary treatment; the determination of criminal responsibility; and, assessing entitlements to state benefits. I suggest that the distinction between 'status' versus 'function' has not been given sufficient weight in discussions of diagnosis. It is in the functional domain that some of the problematic relationships between clinical psychiatry and the social institutions with which it rubs shoulders are played out. A status, signified by a diagnosis, has often been encumbered with demands for which it is poorly equipped. It is a reductive way of solving problems of management, allocation or disposal for which a functional approach should be given greater weight."}, {"Title": "Fledgling pathoconnectomics of psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Pathoconnectomics, the mapping of abnormal brain networks, is a popular current framework for the study of brain dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.

We consider the evidence for the abnormal brain-network nature of psychiatric disorders and find it inconclusive.

It is suggested that in negative individuation healthy psychological development is hindered and goes astray. Aggression then becomes the central psychic system. Repressed anger is the core element in psychopathic narcissism (Diamond) and malignant narcissism (Kernberg). Both Diamond and Kernberg extend narcissistic personality structure to antisocial, psychopathic personality in an effort to better understand extreme violence. According to Freud, love (libido) and hate (the death drive) are the major motivational systems in the human psyche. In contrast to Freud, Jung sees libido as a life force in general, not simply as a sexual drive. Jung writes about evil and the shadow but does not present a comprehensive theory of the negative development of an individual's life. The concept of negative individuation connects the shadow and the death drive with psychopathology, psychiatry and psychotherapy. In this paper, I explore these concepts in the light of contemporary affect theory according to Kernberg.

Four tasks of formulation implied in the definition provided in the RANZCP Formulation Guidelines for Candidates are identified, and their rationale and theoretical status reviewed.\nTask 1, classification, must address both diagnoses and problems. Task 2, using theory to infer meaning, ideally requires multiple models and theories in development of a set of hypotheses, using inductive inference (plausibility).

The most basic and enduring problem of the DSM is that its classifications are heterogeneous clinical descriptions rather than valid diagnoses, which hampers scientific progress. Therefore, more homogeneous evidence-based diagnostic entities should be developed. To this end, data-driven techniques, such as latent class- and factor analyses, have already been widely applied. However, these techniques are insufficient to account for all relevant levels of heterogeneity, among real-life individuals. There is heterogeneity across persons (p:for example, subgroups), across symptoms (s:for example, symptom dimensions) and over time (t:for example, course-trajectories) and these cannot be regarded separately. Psychiatry should upgrade to techniques that can analyze multi-mode (p-by-s-by-t) data and can incorporate all of these levels at the same time to identify optimal homogeneous subgroups (for example, groups with similar profiles/connectivity of symptomatology and similar course).

Social cognition has been demonstrated to be an essential determinant of daily functioning in schizophrenia. Progress in social neuroscience, together with advanced neuroimaging technology, promotes our understanding of schizophrenia from the viewpoint of social cognition and the social brain."}, {"Title": "[On suggestion and its related problems].", "Abstract": "Recently, intensive discussions about dissociative disorders have led to the rediscovery of the psychology of P. Janet, that has been under the shadow of Freud's psychoanalysis. Nevertheless, psychiatry, \"Schulpsychiatrie\" in German, has still paid little attention to the suggestion with which Janet has occupied himself throughout his long career. In this paper, the author examined suggestion from another point of view other than psychodynamic. It is presented that Freud reduced suggestion to a specific relation between an active subject and a passive object, as his precursors, F.A. Mesmer and R. de Puys\u00e9gur did the same. In contrast, Janet's early studies influenced by the philosophy of M. de Biran seem to focus on another aspect of suggestion. From this aspect, suggestion is based on a spontaneous intersubjective process that should be expressed by the middle voice. Referring to H. Bergson, with whom Janet corresponded, the author pointed out that one is not always one's own self that reflects one's whole life history, regardless of the presence/absence of mental abnormality, as is the case with a person under suggestion. Taking into account these factors of suggestion, i. e., the middle voice and fragile selfhood that is not firmly rooted in one's own life history, the author investigated hysteria as a distinct phenomenon that has a particularly close relation with suggestion. Furthermore, depersonalization and schizophrenia were discussed concerning their relation with hysteria. In this approach, the author suggested that the unconscious could be topographically localized not only in a deep portion of the mental apparatus, but also in its most superficial portion, unlike in the case of Freud's psychoanalysis."}, {"Title": "[The praise of the leak: a tribute to Henri Laborit (1914-1995)].", "Abstract": "Henri Laborit (1914-1995) was a French military MD. He contributed to the discovery of an important molecule that has changed the face of psychiatry, namely chlorpromazine, which became the first drug in the class of first-generation antipsychotics, which later led to the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. He did not receive the Nobel Prize for this discovery, unlike Daniel Bovet who get the Nobel Prize for the discovery of antihistaminics.

Often psychiatry finds itself playing an essential role in dealing with the consequences of conflict or influencing the process. Along with this involvement comes great responsibility as well as many associated ethical dilemmas. Although bound by professional medical oaths, many physicians disregard fundamental medical ethical principles during times of conflict and situations of \"dual loyalty.\" The phenomenon should be addressed so that ethical awareness and sensitivity to these issues are nurtured. Important factors for psychiatrists during times of conflict to consider include their \"social contract\" with the community, dangers of boundary violations, the ethics of media contact, involvement in governmental and political activities and confidentiality. In addition, their role in conflict resolution and unique ethical considerations in the military should be considered. While as regular citizens, psychiatrists in their individual capacity may involve themselves in political activism, at an organizational level it should be discouraged. A physician's skills should only be exploited to save lives and provide comfort as entrusted by society, and any other pursuit, even in the name of the state, should be proscribed. Rather than engage in political activism, psychiatrists can promote the rights of patients, especially if these rights are limited during conflict. Responsibility and ethically-driven commitment needs to be primary for the psychiatrist who involves himself either directly or indirectly with patients during times of conflict. Trauma and its effects during conflict should be addressed without any unbalanced attention to pathological responses."}, {"Title": "Accessible online neuroplasticity-targeted training for children with ADHD.", "Abstract": "Childhood Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a growing mental health concern worldwide.

A survey among clinicians from German forensic-psychiatric institutions.", "Abstract": "Although testosterone-lowering medications (TLM) are a frequently used addition to psychotherapy in sex offender treatment, discord still seems to exist amongst clinicians as to in which cases administering TLM is justified. The depo-Provera scale (DPS), which was published by Maletzky and Field (Aggress Violent Behav 2003;8:391), assesses the appropriateness of TLM administration in sex offender treatment.\nThe DPS was sent to all forensic psychiatric institutions in Germany. The clinical directors of these institutions were asked to rate the importance of each item of the DPS on a six-point Likert scale.\nTwenty-nine clinicians participated. The most important reason selected for the prescription of TLM for sex offender treatment was a \"history of sexual offender treatment failure\". The least important item was \"deviant sexual interest, by plethysmograph or Abel Screen\" (neither plethysmograph nor Abel Screen is used in Germany).\nClinicians' attitudes towards the DPS correspond to the suggestions made in the current WSFBF-guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of sex offenders (Thibaut et al. 2010 ; World J Biol Psychiatry 11:604-655). Use of the DPS could therefore contribute to a more structured approach towards helping clinicians come to a decision about whether or not to treat a sex offender with TLM."}, {"Title": "Sadism in sexual offenders: evidence for dimensionality.", "Abstract": "Recurrent and intense sexual fantasies and urges that circle around the infliction of pain or humiliation on another human being may predispose individuals toward acts of sexual aggression against nonconsenting victims. Consequently, sexual sadism is a paraphilia with particular relevance for forensic psychology and psychiatry. Using behavioral indicators derived from crime scene actions as well as clinical data, we sought in the present study to identify the latent structure of the disorder. We analyzed data from a national sample of male sexual offenders from Austria (N = 1,020). In addition to latent profile analysis, 3 conceptually different taxometric methods were applied. The results of the analyses were more in accordance with a dimensional interpretation than with a categorical distinction.

This column briefly covers the primary changes and summarises the debate about various diagnoses, with a particular focus on diagnoses of relevance to medico-legal psychiatry and the legal system. Underlying concerns about the validity of diagnostic criteria and their applicability to forensic issues are discussed.

There is very little data available on the frequency of school drop-out. In the past two years (2011 and 2012), approximately 2% of all patients seen for the first time at the department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University Zurich, were referred because of failure to attend school, making this phenomenon one of the most common reasons for referral in child and adolescent psychiatry.

A majority of psychiatrists are choosing and avoiding antidepressants in accordance with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines. A minority of respondents are selecting classes of antidepressants, which raises concern about the safety of such prescribing decisions. The majority of psychiatrists expressed a lack of confidence when prescribing and expressed a wish for further training in this area.\nThis study indicates a degree of uncertainty amongst psychiatrists of all grades when prescribing to these special groups.

We review epidemiological and clinical data that point to the important roles psychiatric disorders have in the use and abuse of opioids in patients with chronic pain.\nWe conducted literature searches on the PubMed with the key phrases \"chronic pain\" and \"opioid therapy\" and selected those articles on the epidemiology of comorbidity between chronic pain and psychiatric disorders, the trends in long-term opioid therapy and the clinical trials that involved using opioid therapy for chronic pain or for mental health disorders. We then thoroughly reviewed the bibliography of all relevant articles to identify additional papers to be included in the present review.\nChronic pain is highly comorbid with common psychiatric disorders. Patients with mental health and substance abuse disorders are more likely to receive long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain and more likely to have adverse outcomes from this therapy. Although opioids may exert brief antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in some patients with depression or anxiety, there is scant evidence for long-term benefit from opioid treatment of psychiatric disorders.\nOpioids may be used in current clinical practice as the de facto and only psychiatric treatment for patients with chronic pain, despite little evidence for sustained benefit. The opioid epidemic thus reflects a serious unmet need for better recognition and treatment of common mental health problems in patients with chronic pain.

However, greater understanding of the integrative mechanisms and pathogenesis is essential in order to develop new effective therapies.\nIn this review, the authors emphasize the importance of a 'domain interplay-oriented' approach to experimental affective research. They also highlight the need to expand the scope of anxiolytic drug targets to better understand the pathogenesis of anxiety-spectrum disorders.\nThere is the potential to markedly improve the utility of animal models for affective disorders. First, the authors suggest that one such way would be by analyzing the systems of several domains and their interplay to better understand disease pathogenesis. Further, it could also be improved by expanding the range of model species and by extending the spectrum of anxiolytic drug targets; this would help to focus on emerging and unconventional systems to better develop new therapies."}, {"Title": "Mapping the scientific research on atypical antipsychotic drugs in Spain: a bibliometric assessment.", "Abstract": "We carried out a bibliometric study on the scientific publications in relation to atypical antipsychotic drugs (AADs) in Spain.\nWe used the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases and we applied some bibliometric indicators of paper production and dispersion (Price's law and Bradford's law, respectively).

Kagwa, East african psychiatry, and the Gisu.", "Abstract": "In the early 1960s, medical officers and administrators began to receive reports of what was being described as \"mass madness\" and \"mass hysteria\" in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) and Uganda. Each epidemic reportedly affected between three hundred and six hundred people and, coming in the wake of independence from colonial rule, caused considerable concern. One of the practitioners sent to investigate was Benjamin H. Kagwa, a Ugandan-born psychiatrist whose report represents the first investigation by an African psychiatrist in East Africa. This article uses Kagwa's investigation to explore some of the difficulties facing East Africa's first generation of psychiatrists as they took over responsibility for psychiatry. During this period, psychiatrists worked in an intellectual climate that was both attempting to deal with the legacy of colonial racism, and which placed faith in African psychiatrists to reveal more culturally sensitive insights into African psychopathology. The epidemics were the first major challenge for psychiatrists such as Kagwa precisely because they appeared to confirm what colonial psychiatrists had been warning for years-that westernization would eventually result in mass mental instability. As this article argues, however, Kagwa was never fully able to free himself from the practices and assumptions that had pervaded his discipline under colonial rule. His analysis of the epidemics as a \"mental conflict\" fit into a much longer tradition of psychiatry in East Africa, and stood starkly against the explanations of the local community."}, {"Title": "Reputation and science: examining the effectiveness of DBT in the treatment of borderline personality disorder.", "Abstract": "This paper examines the evidence base for dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) in the treatment of patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD).\nDBT has built an impressive reputation within psychology and psychiatry as an effective treatment for deliberate self harm and chronic suicidal behaviours in patients with BPD.

The Ericksonian view on identity implies self-sameness, continuity and synthesis which the child psychiatry as a specialty and child psychiatrists as professionals are to achieve more or less successfully. As a professional, the child psychiatrist is directed to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders and associated problems in children and adolescents viewing children as developing biopsychological entities being in ongoing co-influencing interaction with their immediate and wider societal contexts. As a discipline, child and adolescent psychiatry needs to integrate developmental biological and psychological aspects, and holistic child-centered and family-focused perspectives. Child psychiatry is to integrate not only various aspects of the child as individual and of his environments as they are, but also in their diachronic dimension. As child psychiatrists, in my view, we must keep integrated in our professional armamentarium the consideration for intra- and interpersonal processes. In that perspective, of special value is the appreciation of setting, of timing, and of interpersonal processes in their interaction with intrapersonal ones. In addition, being both child-centered and family-focused, we need a systemic literacy to look at the families and of children as part of them. Apart from evidence-based information and clinical skills, we need some mature attitude to helpfully use our knowledge and skills. This attitude can transcend the state of the art professional algorithms; rather it integrates and not just imitates them. It cautions against too much enthusiasm in following the pendulum. It implies awareness of some reasonable limit to the urge to change the children and families. In fact, many developmentally and behaviorally disabled children need not only attempts to correction, but also some help to live and develop more successfully with their handicaps. Here, if not everywhere, a facilitating discovery and building on patient's personal assets professional approach is needed. The international integration of \"child psychiatries\" of different countries and world's regions is valuable, and not only with reference to elaborating on and further developing child psychiatry as a theory and practice, but in the view of international co-support, which being almost everywhere under-served child psychiatry and its potential patients-children, adolescents and families-necessitate."}, {"Title": "Julius Wagner-Jauregg (1857-1940): Introducing fever therapy in the treatment of neurosyphilis.", "Abstract": "For centuries, heat has been used in various ways for the cure of mental diseases. Hippocrates noted that malarial fever could have a calming effect in epileptics. Centuries later, Galen described a case of melancholy cured as a result of an attack of quartan fever. In 19th century, the eminent French psychiatrist Philippe Pinel, in his treatise on insanity referred to the beneficial effect of fever. An opinion expressed few years later by his pupil Jean-\u00c9tienne Dominique Esquirol in his treatise entitled Des maladies mentales consid\u00e9r\u00e9es sous les rapports m\u00e9dical, hygi\u00e9nique et m\u00e9dico-l\u00e9gal. However, in 1917, the Austrian neuro-psychiatrist Julius Wagner Jauregg pointed out the therapeutic value of malaria inoculation in the treatment of dementia paralytica. In 1927, Wagner Jauregg received for this work the Nobel Prize in Medicine, being actually the first psychiatrist to win the Nobel Prize. He studied medicine at the University of Vienna and received his doctorate in 1880. In 1889, he was appointed Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Graz's Psychiatric Clinic, a position that he held until 1928. Working in the asylum, Wagner Jauregg noted that insane patients with general paralysis occasionally became sane after some febrile episode. After experimenting with several artificial methods (streptococci, tuberculin) to induce fever, he concluded that malaria was the most satisfactory. Actually, malaria infection was an acceptable risk for the patients, as quinine would be administered as soon as syphilis was cured. In 1917, he reported the first favorable results of his study. Patients were inoculated via intravenous injections with malaria. Some physicians were starting the administration of anti-syphilitic treatment (bismuth, salvarsan and later penicillin) after 10-12 febrile paroxysms, while others initiated the regimen the first febrile-free day after 8 malarial paroxysms. The therapeutic regimen was completed with the administration of quinine sulfate to terminate the malaria infection. It is worth mentioning that the above treatment was followed in hospital under strict monitoring of patients' vital signs and regular laboratory tests. In the following years of his discovery, artificial fever was induced by any one of the following methods: the introduction into the patient of a parasitic disease; the injection of a foreign protein; injections of chemical substances such as sulphur; electrical means such as the administration of diathermy or radiotherapy, or placing the patient in an electromagnetic field; and simple immersion of the individual in a hot bath, or placing him in a heat cabinet. Wagner Jauregg's therapy was highly admired and was used on neurosyphilis cases well onto the 1950's. However, with the introduction of penicillin in syphilis' treatment, fever therapy effectively ended. Wagner Jauregg's study led to all the methods of stress therapy used in psychiatry, as electric shock, and insulin."}, {"Title": "Psychosomatic medicine and liaison psychiatry: empowering patients through imparting information.", "Abstract": "\u03a4he empowerment of patients is a key aspect of professionalism in psychiatry. The sensitive, accurate and timely imparting of information is one of the highest expectations that patients and carers have of health-care professionals. In the course of his clinical work in Liaison Psychiatry the author has developed an information leaflet which reflects established practice and emerging evidence in the broad field of psychosomatic medicine and mind body interactions and psychopathology. Informal feedback from patients, carers and fellow clinicians suggests that it has been well received. Good reception has been found in practice among patients often thought as resistant to psychological approaches to psychosomatics. Necessarily, a single patient information leaflet has limitations in its scope. The focus of the leaflet is primarily on setting the context for understanding processes of somatisation. This supports the establishment of a therapeutic alliance between patient and clinician.

The aim of the study is to point out the characteristics of patients admitted and the influence of European dominant views on mental diseases in Greek psychiatry. Data for 3014 patients (20% of total number) for the period 1901-1985 were obtained via systematic sampling. The data available were: entry date, gender, age, occupation, brief medical history. The 56 diagnoses have been classified into 9 groups. We have used descriptive statistical methods, two-way associations, odds ratios and cluster analysis, permitting to point out the main characteristics of admitted patients. The preponderance of male admissions in the first decades of the 20th century has been progressively balanced out. About a half of total admissions were schizophrenia-related. The percentage of male patients was significantly higher in personality disorders; for major affective disorders and neuroses the opposite occurs.

Poor sleep can attenuate emotional control, including the regulation of aggression, and thus, may increase the risk of impulsive, aggressive acts. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the potential contribution of sleep problems to subjective and objective aggressiveness and impulsivity in a forensic psychiatric population. Questionnaires on sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), chronic severe insomnia (Sleep Diagnosis List), aggressiveness (Aggression Questionnaire) and impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11) were completed by 96 forensic psychiatric inpatients, admitted to two forensic facilities in the Netherlands. To obtain more objective measurements of aggression and impulsivity, observational scores on a professional instrument to assess the risk of future aggression (Historical Clinical Future-30) and reported aggressive incidents were collected from files. Results showed that a worse sleep quality and higher insomnia scores were significantly associated with self-reported aggression and impulsivity, clinician-rated hostility and involvement in aggressive incidents within the facility. Whether a participant was professionally judged as impulsive could not be predicted by sleep quality or the insomnia score. To a large extent the results of this study support the hypothesis that poor sleep is related to impulsive, aggressive behavior in forensic psychiatric patients. It is worthwhile to examine the protective effect of treatment of sleep difficulties on aggressive reactivity in (forensic) psychiatric populations."}, {"Title": "Cognitive and behavioral heterogeneity in genetic syndromes.", "Abstract": "this study aimed to investigate the cognitive and behavioral profiles, as well as the psychiatric symptoms and disorders in children with three different genetic syndromes with similar sociocultural and socioeconomic backgrounds.\nthirty-four children aged 6 to 16 years, with Williams-Beuren syndrome (n=10), Prader-Willi syndrome (n=11), and Fragile X syndrome (n=13) from the outpatient clinics of Child Psychiatry and Medical Genetics Department were cognitively assessed through the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III). Afterwards, a full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ), verbal IQ, performance IQ, standard subtest scores, as well as frequency of psychiatric symptoms and disorders were compared among the three syndromes.\nsignificant differences were found among the syndromes concerning verbal IQ and verbal and performance subtests.

The origins of a controversy over the responsibility of the mentally ill in French forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "While some countries like Belgium chose a penal system clearly inspired by social-defense theories for mentally disturbed criminals, the French law hasn't been consistent and varies from the enlightened classical law and social-defense law. Indeed paragraph 1 of article 122-1 states that people whose discernment or control is abolished by a psychiatric disorder are non-responsible respecting the classical logic of law. On the other hand, Paragraph 2 of Article 122-1 allows the mentally ill to be judged responsible whereas no institution exists to take care about them. Then the system of psychiatric care in prisons present as a solution for professionals wishing to promote a system where people are punished and socially rehabilitated. Thus these forensic psychiatrists don't refer to paragraph 1 of article 122-1 and even people presenting serious mental disorders are considered responsible. Moreover, if a controversy has always existed between psychiatrists who argue a large conception of mental irresponsibility and professionals who defend the right to punish and to conclude that responsibility even for mentally disturbed criminals, the controversy becomes more important in French forensic psychiatry after the Second World War. If until the 1970s the practice of imposing responsibility for mentally ill individuals shows itself as a humanism, it occurs more within a security perspective today."}, {"Title": "Treatment as punishment: forensic psychiatry in The Netherlands (1870-2005).", "Abstract": "This article provides an overview of the development of forensic psychiatry in the Netherlands from the late nineteenth to the early twenty-first century. The first part addresses the ways forensic psychiatry established itself in the period 1870-1925 and focuses on its interrelatedness with forensic practice, psychiatry's professionalization, the role of the government, the influence of the so-called New Direction in legal thinking and (Italian and French) anthropology of crime, and the debates among physicians as well as between psychiatrists and legal experts on the proper approach of mentally disturbed offenders. From the mid-1920s on the so-called 'psychopaths laws' anchored forensic psychiatry in the Dutch legal system. The second part zooms in on the enactment of these laws, which formalized special measures for mentally disturbed delinquents. These implied a combination of sentencing and forced admission to and treatment in a mental institution or some other form of psychiatric surveillance. The article deals with the meaning, reach and consequences of this legislation, its debate by psychiatrists and legal experts, the number of delinquents affected, the offenses for which they were sentenced and the (therapeutic) regime in forensic institutions. The goal of the Dutch legislation on psychopaths was ambiguous: if it was designed to protect society against assumed dangerous criminals, at the same time they were supposed to receive psychiatric treatment to enable their return to regular social life again. These legal and medical objectives were at odds with each other and as a result discussions about collective versus individual interests as well as about the usefulness and the effects of this legislation kept flaring up. To this day the history of this legislation is characterized by the intrinsic tension between punishment and security on the one hand and treatment and re-socialization on the other. Whether at some point one or the other prevailed was largely tied to the social climate with respect to law, order and authority."}, {"Title": "Substance use disorders among treatment na\u00efve first-episode psychosis patients.", "Abstract": "To examine the prevalence of substance use among treatment na\u00efve patients with first episode psychosis presenting to a psychiatry outpatient clinic in India.\nThe study sample consisted of 139 first episode treatment na\u00efve patients with psychosis from in and around Bangalore, a city in South India.

The objective of this study was to provide an in-depth description of this population.\nThe present study is both retrospective and descriptive. Data were collected retrospectively from a file containing the causes for hospitalization of each child admitted into the Department of Child Psychiatry at the h\u00f4pital Femme-M\u00e8re-Enfant (hospices civils de Lyon). We included all patients under 13 years of age who were hospitalized for a suicide attempt between 2008 and 2011. The methods used to collect the medical records consisted in using a form made up of four major parts: suicide attempts, social environment, medical history, and therapy.\nThe 26 girls and 22 boys included had a mean age of 11.52 years. The boys were younger than the girls (P=0.047) and their parents were usually separated (P=0.034). The boys used more violent means to commit suicide in comparison to the girls (P=0.048). On average, children using violent means were younger (P=0.013). Boys underwent more psychotherapy (P=0.027) and were prescribed more psychotropic medication in comparison to girls (P=0.051). Adjustment disorders (37.5%) and depression (27%) were the two main diagnoses for hospitalization. They were hospitalized on average (\u00b1standard deviation) 9.6 days (\u00b110 days). Psychotherapy was organized when leaving the hospital (98%) with legal measures (8.3%), change of residence (12.5%), and prescription of psychotropic drugs (37.5%). None had physical complications.\nIn children under 13 years of age, attempted suicide was more frequent in girls than boys. However, the sample included 18 girls and nine boys who were 12 years old (sex ratio of 12-year-olds, 0.5). There were more boys (16 boys/eight girls) in the children under 12 (sex ratio of 8- to 11-year-olds, 1.6). Children under 11 used more violent means (P=0.01). The literature also reports that more violent means lead to a greater risk of death by suicide. Consequently, suicidal behavior in children under 11 years of age is closer to a behavior of a person who has committed suicide than an adolescent attempting suicide. As a result of the sex ratio and non-violent means, 12-year-old children's behavior can be considered like that of adolescents. One factor that could explain children's attempted suicide is family cohesion. The children in this study were most often from broken families and had a difficult relationship with their parents. From 1981 to 1985, more than 50% of children who consulted for their first suicide attempt were not hospitalized. Now hospitalization is recommended for all children who consult for attempted suicide. They are hospitalized on average 8.9-9 days. Individual psychotherapy is systematic. The main difference between the treatments for adolescents and children is the importance of the social worker who will require legal measures or changing residences when necessary.\nThe sex ratio in 6- to 12-year-olds attempting suicide is higher than the sex ratio in adolescents attempting suicides. Insecure attachment was found in all families in this sample. This population is particularly at risk knowing that in adulthood, the risk of death by suicide is higher when there is a background of attempted suicide by violent methods. These children should always be hospitalized for a psychological and socioenvironmental evaluation."}, {"Title": "Emergent authority and expert knowledge: psychiatry and criminal responsibility in the UK.", "Abstract": "In the UK context, the rise of the discipline and practice of forensic psychiatry is intimately connected with the concurrent development of principles and practices relating to criminal responsibility. In this article, we seek to chart the relationship between psychiatry and the principles and practices of criminal responsibility in the UK over the early modern, modern and late modern periods. With a focus on claims about authority and expert knowledge around criminal responsibility, we suggest that these claims have been in a state of perpetual negotiation and that, as a result, claims to authority over and knowledge about criminal non-responsibility on the part of psychiatrists and psychiatry are most accurately understood as emergent and contingent. The apparent formalism of legal discourse has tended to conceal the extent to which legal policy has been preoccupied with maintaining the primacy of lay judgments in criminal processes of evaluation and adjudication. While this policy has been somewhat successful in the context of the trial - particularly the murder trial - it has been undermined by administrative procedures surrounding the trial, including those that substitute treatment for punishment without, or in spite of, a formal determination of criminal responsibility."}, {"Title": "Undiagnosed and comorbid disorders in patients with presumed chronic fatigue syndrome.", "Abstract": "To assess undiagnosed and comorbid disorders in patients referred to a tertiary care center with a presumed diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).\nPatients referred for chronic unexplained fatigue entered an integrated diagnostic pathway, including internal medicine assessment, psychodiagnostic screening, physiotherapeutic assessment and polysomnography+multiple sleep latency testing.

The present study sought to validate the Brief Symptom Measure-25 (BSM-25) as a brief and easily administered measure of global psychiatric symptom severity in adolescent inpatient samples. This study evaluated the results from 154 adolescent inpatients who completed several self-report measures at admission. The findings demonstrate that the instrument has good construct validity when compared with validated measures of psychological health and well-being, behavioral problems, and interpersonal distress. We also showed the sensitivity to change of the BSM-25 from admission to discharge, and we showed that this healthy change was paralleled in several measures (self-reports and clinician ratings), using data from 75 adolescent psychiatric inpatients who were assessed at admission and also at discharge. Although this is only the first step in the validation of this measure for an adolescent inpatient setting, the BSM-25 shows promise as a brief outcome measure of global psychiatric symptom severity while maintaining validity and instrument sensitivity."}, {"Title": "Drugs in context: a historical perspective on theories of psychopharmaceutical efficacy.", "Abstract": "This article demonstrates that psychoanalysis and socially oriented psychiatry were crucial to the understanding and adoption of the first effective psychopharmaceuticals in North American psychiatry. In the 1950s and the early 1960s, psychoanalysts, socially oriented psychiatrists, and biologists collaborated, debated, and organized interdisciplinary conferences to situate the biochemistry of new psychopharmaceuticals, such as chlorpromazine, in the broader psychosocial context of patients' lives. Psychoanalytical and sociological perspectives not only helped American psychiatrists explain the mechanism of drug action in research but also established the professional authority of psychiatrists over the new pharmaceuticals. As modern pharmacology narrows its focus to microscopic targets in the body, I argue that this early drug research illustrates the present-day need for holistic and interdisciplinary approaches to drug response that acknowledge the psychosocial significance of psychiatric medication in the lives of individuals."}, {"Title": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) at the interface of neurology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an emerging interventional therapy for well-screened patients with specific treatment-resistant neuropsychiatric diseases.

A review of the current state-of-the-art in the biomarker-based early recognition of psychoses].", "Abstract": "The main goal of psychiatric high-risk research--the personalised early recognition and intervention of schizophrenic and affective psychoses--is one of the biggest challenges of current clinical psychiatry due to the immense socioeconomic burden of these disorders. In this regard, this review discusses the prospects and caveats of new clinical, neuropsychological, neurophysiological and imaging-based concepts aimed at optimising the current state-of-the-art of early recognition. Finally, multivariate modelling and machine learning methods are presented as a novel methodological framework facilitating the decoding of early psychosis into different intermediate phenotypes. In the future, these phenotypes could be employed for a more objective risk stratification that operates at the single-subject level. This could allow us to generate clinically applicable prognostic biomarkers for these disorders that would propel the individualised prevention of disease transition, chronification and psychopharmacological treatment resistance of psychotic disorders."}, {"Title": "[The range of adolescent medicine].", "Abstract": "Adolescent medicine is situated \"in between\" and \"on the borders of\" different areas of medical specialisations: psychiatry, gynaecology, preventive medicine, paediatrics and internal medicine (and their respective subspecialties).The specificity of adolescent medicine is the evaluation of clinical situations with a particular consideration of the successive stages of the adolescent bio-psycho social development (puberty, identity construction, modifications of the relations to the peer-groups and the family).

As a result, our understanding of the pathophysiology of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia has expanded, and potential clinical applications are becoming apparent. Unlike most physical illnesses, mental illnesses often lack objective markers, and this is one of the reasons why some patients and their family members experience difficulty in understanding symptoms and disabilities. In some cases, this leads to delays in patients seeking treatment, discontinuation of treatment, and relapse. If biological markers can be utilized as aids in differential diagnosis, selection of treatment options, and assessment of severity and treatment response in clinical settings, they may lead to improved treatment quality and clinical outcomes. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a functional neuroimaging technique that may be a candidate for clinical application in psychiatry. Advantages of NIRS include: 1) its non-invasive nature, with no harmful impact resulting from repeated measurement, even in infants; 2) high temporal resolution (> 10 Hz); 3) compact size, enabling easy movement; and 4) no required restraint position: people undergoing testing may take a natural position, such as sitting or standing, and may converse and perform manual tasks during measurement. Previous NIRS studies have revealed different characteristic waveform patterns during verbal fluency tasks among patients with major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, which led to government approval in 2009 as an \"advanced medical technology to aid in the differential diagnosis of depressive symptoms.\" This was the first approval in the field of psychiatry in Japan. Future NIRS studies will focus more on clinical applications, and multi-site studies are needed to assess the impact of non-illness factors such as age, sex, and head size, in addition to factors related to illness, including differences in sub-type diagnosis, severity of symptoms, and treatment. It is hoped that findings will support the development of new biomarkers that will facilitate differential diagnosis, better understanding of present conditions and prognosis, and decisions regarding treatment options."}, {"Title": "[Characteristics of single event-related cerebral hemodynamics during verbal task in emotionally charged state measured by multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in patients with schizophrenia: comparison with healthy subjects].", "Abstract": "Neared infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is one of the recently developed methodologies which can measure cerebral blood volumes to determine the blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration simultaneously at multiple points with marked time resolution. Monitoring the changes in the Hb concentration yields site-specific readings on blood flow and, thus, on neural activities. The aim of this study was to examine the characteristics of a single event-related oxyhemoglobin concentration [oxy-Hb] changes in patients with schizophrenia using multi-channel NIRS during a word generation task, Japanese 'Shiritori', and single-word generation task in an emotionally charged state induced by three facial expressions of \"crying\", \"neutral\", and \"smiling\" babies' photographs. Thirty-four patients with schizophrenia and 34 age-matched healthy controls participated in the present study after giving consent. In healthy controls, [oxy-Hb] changes when viewing the \"crying\" baby's photograph were significantly larger than when viewing the \"smiling\" baby's photograph. On the other hand, in patients with schizophrenia, [oxy-Hb] changes when viewing the \"smiling\" baby's photograph were significantly larger than when viewing the \"crying\" baby's photograph. These results suggest that cautions/execution functions in patients with schizophrenia during the single event word \"Shiritori\" task measured by multi-channel NIRS were impaired. It was also suggested that, in patients with schizophrenia, the affective reaction influenced by each photograph may be different from healthy controls (mismatch). Multi-channel NIRS can be a useful tool for research and clinical purposes in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Impact of active monitoring on lithium management in Norfolk.", "Abstract": "Lithium has been used in the fields of rheumatology and psychiatry since the 1800s and it is now generally considered to be a gold standard treatment for bipolar disorders. However, lithium is known to have significant side effects and requires close serum level monitoring to ensure levels remain within the therapeutic range to minimize the risk of serious adverse effects or toxicity. This article reviews the monitoring of lithium and reports on the implementation of a regional lithium register and database within Norfolk.\nRecorded blood results from the Norfolk lithium database were extracted for the first full year of operation across the region, 2005/6, and from the most recent full year 2011/12. The number of lithium monitoring tests, U&Es and thyroid function tests conducted on all people registered on the database were compared between the two sample years.\nIn 2005/6 there were a significant number of people not receiving the recommended number of four or more serum lithium test per year (68.3%) and the majority of people had two or three tests (62%). By 2011/12 this had noticeably increased with the majority of patients having four or more tests per year (68.5%) and the number having only two or three tests reducing dramatically (26.4%).\nImproved rates of lithium testing and monitoring have been demonstrated since the introduction of the Norfolk database helping to achieve national targets.

A more flexible system, which shares at an earlier stage experience and evidence on benefits and risks in patients, previously marginalized on the grounds of age, diagnosis or comorbidity, would aid the development of safer, more effective 'real-world prescribing'.

The main reason is that mental illness is poorly understood and can be difficult to treat. Most diagnostic fads have involved the extension of well-known categories into broader spectra. The most prominent treatment fads have involved the overuse of pharmacological interventions and a proliferation of methods for psychotherapy. The best antidote to fads is a commitment to evidence-based psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry and fads: why is this field different from all other fields?", "Abstract": "Fads in psychiatry are little more than bad ideas with short half-lives. They have arisen because of the great discontinuities that have swept psychiatry unlike other specialties in the 20th century: the transition in the 1920s from asylum-based biological psychiatry to psychoanalysis, and the transition in the 1960s from psychoanalysis to a biological model based on psychopharmacology. In no other medical specialty has the knowledge base been scrapped and rebuilt, and then again scrapped and rebuilt. In these great transitions, when psychiatry each time has had to reconstruct from scratch, bad ideas have crept in with good. Psychiatry, in its heavy use of consensus conferences, is often unable to employ science as a means of discarding fads, which, once installed, are often difficult to remove. Each of the great paradigms of psychiatry in the last hundred years has given rise to fads, and psychopharmacology is no exception, with faddish uses of neurotransmitter doctrine claiming centre stage.

Since the beginning of the 1970s, contributors to the literature of transcultural psychiatry in Germany have been predominantly concerned with the mental health of migrant workers from Mediterranean countries, particularly the practical difficulties and therapeutic implications of inpatient psychiatric treatment of these migrant groups. The inauguration of the Section on Transcultural Psychiatry of the German Association for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy 20 years ago reflected an increasing scientific interest in this topic. In addition to the psychic impact of migration, research into transcultural care is currently focused on disparities in the utilization of health care and conjectured barriers to access to health and mental health care among migrants. Furthermore, studies based on epidemiological approaches have been carried out in order to resolve the question of whether migrants are as affected by mental disorders as the ethnic German population, and which issues contribute to the so-called \"healthy migrant\" effect. Other topics that have been explored in the last 10 years are the particular psychosocial situation of asylum seekers and refugees in Germany, and the effects of inadequate integration and discrimination on their mental health.

This study examined the impact of a one-time contact-based educational intervention on the stigma of mental illness among medical students and compared this with a multimodal undergraduate psychiatry course at the University of Calgary, Canada that integrates contact-based educational strategies. Attitudes towards mental illness were compared with those towards type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\nA cluster-randomized trial design was used to evaluate the impact of contact-based educational interventions delivered at two points in time. The impact was assessed by collecting data at 4 time points using the Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC) to assess changes in stigma.\nBaseline surveys were completed by 62% (n=111) of students before the start of the course and post-intervention ratings were available from 90 of these. Stigma scores for both groups were significantly reduced upon course completion (p < 0.0001), but were not significantly changed following the one-time contact based educational intervention in the primary analysis. Student confidence in working with people with a mental illness and interest in a psychiatric career was increased at the end of the course. Stigma towards mental illness remained greater than for T2DM at all time points.\nPsychiatric education can decrease the stigma of mental illness and increase student confidence. However, one-time, contact-based educational interventions require further evaluation in this context. The key components are postulated to be contact, knowledge and attention to process, where attending to the student's internal experience of working with people with mental illness is an integral factor in modulating perceptions of mental illness and a psychiatric career."}, {"Title": "Neuron-glia interaction as a possible glue to translate the mind-brain gap: a novel multi-dimensional approach toward psychology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Neurons and synapses have long been the dominant focus of neuroscience, thus the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders has come to be understood within the neuronal doctrine. However, the majority of cells in the brain are not neurons but glial cells including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. Traditionally, neuroscientists regarded glial functions as simply providing physical support and maintenance for neurons. Thus, in this limited role glia had been long ignored. Recently, glial functions have been gradually investigated, and increasing evidence has suggested that glial cells perform important roles in various brain functions. Digging up the glial functions and further understanding of these crucial cells, and the interaction between neurons and glia may shed new light on clarifying many unknown aspects including the mind-brain gap, and conscious-unconscious relationships.

We argue that neuroimaging has the potential to improve psychiatric treatment in two ways. First, by reducing phenotypic complexity, neuroimaging intermediate phenotypes can help to identify disease-related genes and can shed light into the biological mechanisms of known risk genes. Second, quantitative neuroimaging markers - reflecting the spectrum of impairment on a brain-based level - can be used as a more sensitive, reliable and immediate treatment response biomarker.

Antisaccades have proved to be an important tool for diagnostic purposes in neurology, psychology and psychiatry, providing invaluable insights into attentional function, decision making and the functionality of eye movement control. Recent findings have suggested, however, that latency differences between pro- and antisaccades can be eliminated by manipulating target-location probabilities. Pro- and antisaccades were equally fast to locations where a target rarely appeared, a finding that may be of promise for more elaborate diagnoses of neurological and psychiatric illness and further understanding of the eye movement system. Here, we tested probability manipulations for a number of different pro- and antisaccade tasks of varied difficulty. Probability only modulated antisaccade costs in a difficult antisaccade task involving decisional uncertainty with low target saliency. For other tasks including standard ones from the literature, target-location probability asymmetries had minimal effects. Probability modulation of antisaccade costs may therefore reflect effects upon decision making rather than saccade generation. This may limit the usefulness of probability manipulations of antisaccades for diagnostic purposes in neurology, psychology and related disciplines."}, {"Title": "How psychiatry journals support the unbiased translation of clinical research.

No study has so far investigated the extent to which author instructions in psychiatry journals encourage following reporting guidelines and trial registration.\nPsychiatry Journals were identified from the 2011 Journal Citation Report. Information given in the author instructions and during the submission procedure of all journals was assessed on whether major reporting guidelines, trial registration and the ICMJE's URM in general were mentioned and adherence recommended.\nWe included 123 psychiatry journals (English and German language) in our analysis. A minority recommend or require 1) following the URM (21%), 2) adherence to reporting guidelines such as CONSORT, PRISMA, STROBE (23%, 7%, 4%), or 3) registration of clinical trials (34%).

In this period, the judicial authorities required psychiatric testimonies in a rising number of cases. As a result, more offenders than ever before were declared mentally deficient and, eventually, sent to psychiatric asylums. Psychiatrists also enhanced their authority as experts at the political level. From the very beginning, they got involved in the preparatory works for a nationwide criminal code. In this article, I argue that these trends toward medicalization of crime were due to incremental processes, rather than spectacular institutional changes. In fact, Swiss psychiatrists gained recognition as experts due to their daily interactions with judges, public prosecutors, and legal counsels. At the same time, the spread of medical expertise had serious repercussions on psychiatric institutions. From 1942 onwards, asylums had to deal with a growing number of \"criminal psychopaths,\" which affected ward discipline and put psychiatry's therapeutic efficiency into question. The defensive way in which Swiss psychiatrists reacted to this predicament was crucial to the further development of forensic psychiatry. For the most part, it accounts for the subdiscipline's remarkable lack of specialization until the 1990s."}, {"Title": "Lessons from psychiatry in the Arab world--a Lebanese trainee psychiatrist's qualitative views on the provision of mental healthcare services for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and an interview with a consultant psychiatrist on the effects of the Arab spring on the mental health of Libyans.", "Abstract": "In this manuscript, a Lebanese trainee psychiatrist qualitatively analyses and discusses the provision of mental healthcare services for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. There are more than 250,000 Palestinian people sporadically dispersed in the refugee camps in Sidon, Beirut and other major cities in the Levant. Displacement, conflict, trauma, unemployment and poverty are but some of the myriad factors that influence Palestinian refugee mental health. This article traces the historical, political and socioeconomic determinants of health for Palestinians exiled in Lebanon and describes the pivotal role that the non-Govenmental Organisation Medical Aid for Palestinians is playing in helping to alleviate the psychiatric distress of Palestinian sufferers of mental illness. The latter half of the manuscript contains an interview with a consultant psychiatrist about his experiences volunteering in the war-torn lands of Libya post Arab Spring. He expounds on how he feels mental healthcare services in Libya are woefully inadequate and broaches on his perception of how the resilience and the 'family-centric' model of the Libyan people has conferred a certain degree of protection towards developing severe psychiatric illness."}, {"Title": "Establishing outcome measures for shared care in the treatment of depression.", "Abstract": "Collaborative care between general practitioners and mental health specialists has been shown to improve the care of patients with depression in primary care and may be an important development in mental health services. Outcome measures are becoming increasingly important in psychiatry as we attempt to alter and improve the structure of services. In this article we propose a series of outcome measures that can be used to measure the effectiveness of shared care for patients with depression including objective measures of improvement in psychopathology and subjective measures of patient and professional experience."}, {"Title": "The mental health of newly graduated doctors in Malta.", "Abstract": "Several studies have shown high rates of psychiatric morbidity in young doctors at various stages of their training (Paice, et al. 2002, Levine et al. 2006). Migration is also known to have an impact on emotional wellbeing (Bhugra 2004). Foreign doctors in Malta now make up over 30% of the junior doctor cohort. This is a new situation for trainers here.This study was carried out in part fulfillment of the requirements for the completion of Specialist Training in Psychiatry in Malta. This article focuses on the first part of the study: the quantitative analysis aimed to answer the following questions: 1. What are the rates of mental health problems amongst recently qualified doctors? 2. What are the factors associated with the increased rates of mental distress?\nA quantitative cross-sectional analysis was carried out by means of self-report questionnaire including demographic details and the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) (Goldberg 1972). This study was approved by the Health Ethics Committee (HEC23/12).\n117 (78.5%) of junior doctors participated in this study. 70.9% were Maltese. 49.4% were found to have GHQ-28 scores of more than 6, indicating significant psychological distress. Further analyses revealed that lack of leisure time (p<0.001), uncertainty (p=0.009), migration (p=0.03) and being female (p=0.04) were significantly related to caseness.\nAs trainers and supervisors in medical education, it is important to be aware of the difficulties that young doctors face. These may include psychological distress, significant enough to reach caseness. Lack of leisure time seems to be an important factor which is possibly an area that can be easily tackled."}, {"Title": "Liaison psychiatry in Poland--can we achieve a successful holistic diagnosis?", "Abstract": "New decades introduce more and more new medical specialties with the inevitable progress of medical science. This is due to the increasing amount of knowledge, and in opposition to the physical and intellectual faculties of a single man. In contrast to the time of Hippocrates, today one cannot be an expert in every field of medicine. We need to consult with specialists in various fields, in order to properly diagnose the patient. Without this the final diagnosis is often impossible.\nThe objective of our survey was to check how often psychiatrists use consultation with physicians in other specialties, and whether there is a relationship between the place of work, academic degree, work experience in the profession, and the number of commissioned consultations. It was also important for us whether consultations affect the final diagnosis.\nMost of the respondents are young doctors, specialists from big cities. They rarely consult with doctors of other specialties - 1/10 cases. However they are skeptical about the opinions of other psychiatrists. In contrast the proctologist and the pathologist are the least frequent groups of specialists who are requested for a consultation by psychiatrists. Specialists consulting the most often are internists and neurologists.\nThe key to a diagnostic success is a holistic view of the patient. It is necessary therefore to develop the most effective cooperation between doctors of various specialties."}, {"Title": "A long term clinical diagnostic-therapeutic evaluation of 30 case reports of bipolar spectrum mixed states.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to show how managing long term patients who are diagnosed as having bipolar disorder with an affective mixed states can cause them to achieve a high level of recovery from the illness and quality of life. This study observed all consecutive new patients who were seen in a private psychiatry practice during the years 2008-2009-2010 who had a diagnosis within the mixed states sub-group (Irritable Cyclothymia, Mixed Disphoria and Agitated Depression)Thirty patients were selected who presented with a score of less than 40 on the Global Assessment Scale (GAS). They were reassessed by readministering the GAS scale after six months and after two years treatment.

WPBAs are a new form of UK mandatory assessment.\nTwo focus group interviews were held with psychiatry trainees at different stages of training in Cambridge, UK.\nTrainees identified a number of opportunities and barriers of WPBAs as formative assessment tools, and gave suggestions for their further development. A key opportunity was the compulsion for supervisors to observe trainees in clinical practice, and to provide individually tailored feedback. Barriers to learning were ideological, such as the emphasis on grades rather than formative feedback; and practical, such as the time taken for assessments. Suggestions for development of WPBAs included redesigning the forms to incorporate more formative feedback, and improving training in WPBAs.\nThe perceptions of psychiatry trainees towards WPBAs are mixed and would benefit from further exploration."}, {"Title": "Mood disorders in adolescents: concepts and interrogations among Francophone psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "With the publication of DSM III, the nosology of children and adolescents' disorders has evolved differently in Francophone and Anglo-Saxon countries. We want to 1 / familiarize readers with the nosographic concepts of mood disorders and bipolar disorders in the Francophone world of Adolescent Psychiatry; 2/ highlight the major current issues of concern to both Francophone and Anglo-Saxon adolescents' psychiatrists.\nA review of the literature in PubMed, PsycINFO and PsycARTICLES, but also of Francophone journals or textbooks not included in these databases nor distributed outside Francophone countries.\nAlthough Francophone adolescents' psychiatrists still rely on the DSM II, particularly in reference to the transitory dimension of problems during adolescence, the DSM III led to a tightening of criteria for bipolar disorder in the Anglo-Saxon countries. These disorders have become rare in the 2000s while still common in Francophone countries. Nowadays the evolution of current criteria in Anglo-Saxon countries tends to bring the diagnostic criteria closer to the Francophone's one even though important differences still persist.\nDespite differences between these two approaches in Psychiatry, there is agreement regarding the poor prognosis of type I bipolar disorder, particularly when psychotic traits are observed. Early diagnosis and treatment are therefore a challenge for both, but their limitations are inherent to their respective approaches. In Anglo-Saxon countries, if the criteria are met for bipolar disorder, treatment is decided at the risk of over-diagnosis and stigmatization of false positives. In Francophone countries, even if the criteria for bipolar disorder are met, it is still necessary that the psychopathological analysis of the disorder in the developmental framework of adolescence confirms that the disorder is stable, at the risk of later treatment and of increase of insufficiently treated false negatives. A reconciliation of these fields may limit the above side effects."}, {"Title": "Tinnitus and psychiatric comorbidities in liaison psychiatry analysis of three years in an audiophonology centre.", "Abstract": "Patients who are suffering from tinnitus are rarely directly referred to an audiophonology centre. Often, they have tried several medications and met with several doctors. Sometimes, they are also referred too quickly to a psychiatrist without a complete ENT assessment. Nevertheless, they frequently develop psychiatric comorbidities in regard to the tinnitus.\nOn the basis of structured interviews with the \"Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview\" and on a review of records, we assessed the associated psychiatric diagnoses in patients who consulted for tinnitus as their main complaint at the audiophonology centre from the University Hospital Centre of Mont-Godinne-Dinant between 2009 and 2012.\nOf the 80 patients who consulted for tinnitus, 28% suffered from a major depressive disorder, 27.5% from a somatoform disorder, 23.7% from sleep disorder, 22.5% from an anxiety disorder and 16% from alcoholic dependence.\nOn the basis of these results, we developed clinical considerations concerning the treatment approach and options for patients suffering from tinnitus with psychiatric comorbidities.\nThe interdisciplinary approach (ENT and liaison psychiatry) in an audiophonology centre seems to be a factor for better treatment adherence for patients with severe and chronic tinnitus."}, {"Title": "Use of expert panels to define the reference standard in diagnostic research: a systematic review of published methods and reporting.", "Abstract": "In diagnostic studies, a single and error-free test that can be used as the reference (gold) standard often does not exist. One solution is the use of panel diagnosis, i.e., a group of experts who assess the results from multiple tests to reach a final diagnosis in each patient. Although panel diagnosis, also known as consensus or expert diagnosis, is frequently used as the reference standard, guidance on preferred methodology is lacking. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of methods used in panel diagnoses and to provide initial guidance on the use and reporting of panel diagnosis as reference standard.\nPubMed was systematically searched for diagnostic studies applying a panel diagnosis as reference standard published up to May 31, 2012. We included diagnostic studies in which the final diagnosis was made by two or more persons based on results from multiple tests. General study characteristics and details of panel methodology were extracted. Eighty-one studies were included, of which most reported on psychiatry (37%) and cardiovascular (21%) diseases. Data extraction was hampered by incomplete reporting; one or more pieces of critical information about panel reference standard methodology was missing in 83% of studies. In most studies (75%), the panel consisted of three or fewer members. Panel members were blinded to the results of the index test results in 31% of studies. Reproducibility of the decision process was assessed in 17 (21%) studies. Reported details on panel constitution, information for diagnosis and methods of decision making varied considerably between studies.\nMethods of panel diagnosis varied substantially across studies and many aspects of the procedure were either unclear or not reported. On the basis of our review, we identified areas for improvement and developed a checklist and flow chart for initial guidance for researchers conducting and reporting of studies involving panel diagnosis.

To illustrate how local responses to trauma may be therapeutic, we consider the multiple dimensions or domains that may be targeted by healing rituals and interventions. We then outline a theoretical model of the generation of trauma-related symptoms and distress. We present the multiplex model of symptom generation which posits multiple cognitive, social, and physiological mechanisms by which various triggers can lead to severe distress among trauma victims in acute episodes, and which may be targeted in treatment. More persistent forms of distress can be explained in terms of the effects of persistent mood states and associated modes of cognitive processing and behavior that render individuals vulnerable to chronic symptoms and acute exacerbations. The beneficial effects of healing rituals and interventions may occur, in part, by inducing positive affective states associated with a flexible mind-set. We conclude by summarizing some of the contributions of the papers in this issue to understanding local therapeutic processes of healing."}, {"Title": "[Discontinuities and reappearances: between the normal and the pathological in the theory of social control].", "Abstract": "This text highlights ambiguities and gaps in the distinction between pathology and normality in the social and individual ambits dating back to the late nineteenth century and reemerging in another guise in contemporary times. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, many authors adopted the theory of atavic criminality defended by Italian criminal anthropologists led by Lombroso. The French school criticized Italian biological determinism and left to the 'psi' sciences the aspects it deemed to be the individual dimension of criminality. Taking advantage of this space, psychiatry created the 'psychopath', inheritor in many ways of the 'innate criminal', and today accepted as a psychopathological category. In this context, the article focuses on social control involving the distinction between pathology and normality in the social and individual spheres."}, {"Title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in consultation-liaison psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Patients with clinical diseases often present psychiatric conditions whose pharmacological treatment is hampered due to hazardous interactions with the clinical treatment and/or disease. This is particularly relevant for major depressive disorder, the most common psychiatric disorder in the general hospital. In this context, nonpharmacological interventions could be useful therapies; and, among those, noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) might be an interesting option. The main methods of NIBS are repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which was recently approved as a nonresearch treatment for some psychiatric conditions, and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a technique that is currently limited to research scenarios but has shown promising results. Therefore, our aim was to review the main medical conditions associated with high depression rates, the main obstacles for depression treatment, and whether these therapies could be a useful intervention for such conditions. We found that depression is an important and prevalent comorbidity in a variety of diseases such as epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson's disease, myocardial infarction, cancer, and in other conditions such as pregnancy and in patients without enteral access. We found that treatment of depression is often suboptimal within the above contexts and that rTMS and tDCS therapies have been insufficiently appraised. We discuss whether rTMS and tDCS could have a significant impact in treating depression that develops within a clinical context, considering its unique characteristics such as the absence of pharmacological interactions, the use of a nonenteral route, and as an augmentation therapy for antidepressants."}, {"Title": "Chronic pain and pain-related disability across psychiatric disorders in a clinical adolescent sample.", "Abstract": "People who suffer from psychiatric disorders are burdened with a high prevalence of chronic illnesses and pain, but evidence on pain prevalence among adolescents with psychiatric disorders is scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and location of self-reported chronic pain and pain-related disability in adolescent psychiatric patients.\nThis study was part of the larger Health Survey administered at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (CAP) at St. Olav's University Hospital, in Trondheim, Norway. All patients aged 13-18 years who visited the CAP clinic at least once between February 15, 2009 and February 15, 2011 were invited to participate. A total of 717 (43.5% of eligible/invited patients) participated; of these, 566 were diagnosed with one or more psychiatric disorders. The adolescents completed a questionnaire, which included questions about pain and pain-related disability. Clinical diagnoses were classified by a clinician according to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision criteria.\nIn adolescents with psychiatric disorders, 70.4% reported chronic pain, and 37.3% experienced chronic pain in three or more locations (multisite pain). Chronic musculoskeletal pain was the most prevalent type of pain (57.7%). Pain-related disability was found in 22.2% of the sample. The frequency of chronic pain and multisite pain increased with age, and girls reported a higher frequency of chronic pain, multisite pain and pain-related disability than boys did. There was an increased risk of chronic pain among adolescents with mood or anxiety disorders versus those with hyperkinetic disorders, yet this was not present after adjusting for sex. Comorbidity between hyperkinetic and mood or anxiety disorders involved an increased risk of pain-related disability.\nIn this study, seven out of 10 adolescents with psychiatric disorders reported chronic pain. These findings indicate the importance of early detection of chronic pain in adolescents with psychiatric disorders, to provide targeted treatment and reduce poor long-term outcomes."}, {"Title": "Mental disorder and criminality in Canada.", "Abstract": "This article examines the relationship between mental disorder and criminality in Canada from the colonial period to the landmark 1992 Mental Disorder Amendments that followed the passing of Bill C-30. The history of this relationship has been shaped by longstanding formal and informal systems of social regulation, by the contests of federal-provincial jurisdiction, by changing trends in the legal and psychiatric professions, and by amendments to the federal Criminal Code. A study of these longer-term features demonstrates that there has been no linear path of progress in Canada's response to mentally unwell offenders. Those caught in the web of crime and mental disorder have been cast and recast over the past 150 years by the changing dynamics of criminal law, psychiatry, and politics. A long historical perspective suggests how earlier and more contemporary struggles over mental disorder and criminality are connected, how these struggles are bound by historical circumstance, and how a few relatively progressive historical moments emerging from these struggles might be recovered, and theorized to advantage."}, {"Title": "DSM-5 and RDoC: progress in psychiatry research?", "Abstract": "Neuroscience studies into psychiatric disorders generally rely on disease definitions that are based on the influential Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the fifth edition of which (DSM-5) was released earlier this year. Designed as a purely diagnostic tool, the DSM considers different disorders as distinct entities. However, boundaries between disorders are often not as strict as the DSM suggests. To provide an alternative framework for research into psychiatric disorders, the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has recently introduced its Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project. In the RDoC, five 'domains' each reflect a brain system in which functioning is impaired, to different degrees, in different psychiatric conditions. Nature Reviews Neuroscience asked six leading investigators for their thoughts on how DSM-5 and the RDoC will influence neuroscience research into psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "The phenomenology of deep brain stimulation-induced changes in OCD: an enactive affordance-based model.", "Abstract": "People suffering from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) do things they do not want to do, and/or they think things they do not want to think. In about 10% of OCD patients, none of the available treatment options is effective. A small group of these patients is currently being treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS involves the implantation of electrodes in the brain. These electrodes give a continuous electrical pulse to the brain area in which they are implanted. It turns out that patients may experience profound changes as a result of DBS treatment. It is not just the symptoms that change; patients rather seem to experience a different way of being in the world. These global effects are insufficiently captured by traditional psychiatric scales, which mainly consist of behavioral measures of the severity of the symptoms. In this article we aim to capture the changes in the patients' phenomenology and make sense of the broad range of changes they report. For that we introduce an enactive, affordance-based model that fleshes out the dynamic interactions between person and world in four aspects. The first aspect is the patients' experience of the world. We propose to specify the patients' world in terms of a field of affordances, with the three dimensions of broadness of scope (\"width\" of the field), temporal horizon (\"depth\"), and relevance of the perceived affordances (\"height\"). The second aspect is the person-side of the interaction, that is, the patients' self-experience, notably their moods and feelings. Thirdly, we point to the different characteristics of the way in which patients relate to the world. And lastly, the existential stance refers to the stance that patients take toward the changes they experience: the second-order evaluative relation to their interactions and themselves. With our model we intend to specify the notion of being in the world in order to do justice to the phenomenological effects of DBS treatment."}, {"Title": "Genome-wide association study of atypical psychosis.", "Abstract": "Atypical psychosis with a periodic course of exacerbation and features of major psychiatric disorders [schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD)] has a long history in clinical psychiatry in Japan. Based upon the new criteria of atypical psychosis, a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) was conducted to identify the risk gene or variants. The relationships between atypical psychosis, SZ and BD were then assessed using independent GWAS data. Forty-seven patients with solid criteria of atypical psychosis and 882 normal controls (NCs) were scanned using an Affymetrics 6.0 chip. GWAS SZ data (560 SZ cases and 548 NCs) and GWAS BD (107 cases with BD type 1 and 107 NCs) were compared using gene-based analysis. The most significant SNPs were detected around the CHN2/CPVL genes (rs245914, P\u2009=\u20091.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-7)) , COL21A1 gene (rs12196860, P\u2009=\u20092.45\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-7) ), and PYGL/TRIM9 genes (rs1959536, P\u2009=\u20097.73\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-7) ), although none of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms exhibited genome-wide significance (P\u2009=\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-8) ). One of the highest peaks was detected on the major histocompatibility complex region, where large SZ GWASs have previously disclosed an association. The gene-based analysis suggested significant enrichment between SZ and atypical psychosis (P\u2009=\u20090.01), but not BD.

From the mid-nineteenth century, Russia as a nation-state struggled to reform, collapsed, re-constituted itself in a bloody civil war, metastasized into a violent \"totalitarian\" regime, reformed and stagnated under \"mature socialism\" and then embraced capitalism and \"managed democracy\" at the end of the twentieth century. These upheavals had indelible effects on policing and the administration of justice, and on psychiatry's relationship with them. In Russia, physicians specializing in medicine of the mind had to cope with rapid and radical changes of legal and institutional forms, and sometimes, of the state itself. Despite this challenging environment, psychiatrists showed themselves to be active professionals seeking to guide the transformations that inevitably touched their work. In the second half of the nineteenth century debates about the role of psychiatry in criminal justice took place against a backdrop of increasingly alarming terrorist activity, and call for revolution. While German influence, with its preference for hereditarianism, was strong, Russian psychiatry was inclined toward social and environmental explanations of crime. When revolution came in 1917, the new communist regime quickly institutionalized forensic psychiatry. In the aftermath of revolution, the institutionalization of forensic psychiatry \"advanced\" with each turn of the state's transformation, with profound consequences for practitioners' independence and ethical probity. The abuses of Soviet psychiatry under Stalin and more intensively after his death in the 1960s-80s remain under-researched and key archives are still classified.

Compared to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BD) has received limited attention in this regard. In this paper, we review the available literature in order to explore the public health significance of BD and the extent to which this may justify the development of early intervention strategies for this disorder.\nThe main computerized psychiatric literature databases were accessed. This included Medline and PsychInfo, using the following keywords: bipolar, early intervention, staging model, burden, caregiver, public health, and manic depression.\nBD is often recurrent and has an impact that goes well beyond symptomatic pathology. The burden it incurs is linked not only to its cardinal clinical features, but also to cognitive dysfunction, poor functional outcome, poor physical health, high rate of comorbidities, and suicide. At a societal level, BD induces enormous direct and indirect costs and has a major impact on caregivers. The available literature reveals a usually long delay between illness onset and the start of treatment, and the absence of specific guidelines for the treatment of the early phase of BD.\nConsidering the major impact of BD on patients and society, there is an urgent need for the development of early intervention strategies aimed at earlier detection and more specific treatment of the early phase of the disorder."}, {"Title": "Practitioner review: maternal mood in pregnancy and child development--implications for child psychology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The empirical base suggesting a link between prenatal maternal anxiety, stress or depression and cognitive, behavioral, and biological outcomes in the infant and child has increased dramatically in the past 10 years.\nIn this review, we consider the relevance of prenatal maternal mood for child mental health practitioners; the empirical base for a likely causal impact of the link between prenatal anxiety, depression, or stress and child outcomes; the degree to which the available evidence is sufficient for informing or altering clinical practice; and the possible role of prenatal interventions for promoting child health and development. A selective review of PubMed, Cochrane Library and other sources was undertaken.\nClinically significant links between maternal prenatal distress and child behavioral and cognitive outcomes have been reported; predictions to stress physiology, immunology, and neurodevelopment have been reported but the effect sizes and clinical significance is less clear.

Improved understanding of brain circuitries and their involvement in various neurological and psychiatric illnesses, coupled with the safety of DBS and its exquisite role as a tool for ethical study of the human brain, have unlocked new opportunities for this technology, both for future therapies and in research. Serendipitous discoveries and advances in structural and functional imaging are providing abundant \"new\" brain targets for an ever-increasing number of pathologies, leading to investigations of DBS in diverse neurological, psychiatric, behavioral, and cognitive conditions. Trials and \"proof of concept\" studies of DBS are underway in pain, epilepsy, tinnitus, OCD, depression, and Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, as well as in eating disorders, addiction, cognitive decline, consciousness, and autonomic states. In parallel, ongoing technological development will provide pulse generators with longer battery longevity, segmental electrode designs allowing a current steering, and the possibility to deliver \"on-demand\" stimulation based on closed-loop concepts. The future of brain stimulation is certainly promising, especially for movement disorders-that will remain the main indication for DBS for the foreseeable future-and probably for some psychiatric disorders. However, brain stimulation as a technique may be at risk of gliding down a slippery slope: Some reports indicate a disturbing trend with suggestions that future DBS may be proposed for enhancement of memory in healthy people, or as a tool for \"treatment\" of \"antisocial behavior\" and for improving \"morality.\""}, {"Title": "[Karl Jaspers. 100 years of \u201cAllgemeine Psychopathologie\u201d (General Psychopathology)].", "Abstract": "With his \"Allgemeine Psychopathologie\" (general psychopathology) published in 1913, Karl Jaspers laid a comprehensive methodological and systematic foundation in psychiatry. Following Edmund Husserl, the founder of philosophical phenomenology, Jaspers introduced \"static understanding\" into psychopathology, i.e. the unprejudiced reproduction of conscious phenomena. From the philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey he further adopted the distinction between causal understanding as a means of accessing nature and pathological processes and hermeneutic understanding, also called genetic understanding, as a way of accessing mental phenomena. The intrusion of an event that is incomprehensible in terms of an understandable development is seen as indicating an extraconscious phenomenon or transition to a somatic process. Jaspers opted for philosophy early in his life. After quitting law studies he graduated in medicine, arrived in psychopathology without any psychiatric training, to psychology without ever studying psychology and to a chair in philosophy without a degree in philosophy. Despite believing himself to be chronically ill and to die early, Jaspers produced a life\u2019s work almost immeasurable in scope. He died in 1969 aged 86 years."}, {"Title": "The brain through the retina: the flash electroretinogram as a tool to investigate psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Investigating the living brain remains one of the major obstacles in psychiatry research in order to better understand the biological underpinning of brain disorders. Novel approaches are needed to study brain functions indirectly. Since it is part of the central nervous system, retinal functions as measured with the flash electroretinogram (ERG) may reflect the central dysfunctions reported in psychiatric disorders. This review describes the flash ERG anomalies reported in patients with psychiatric disorders such as seasonal affective disorder, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and drug addiction and discusses how changes in retinal functions might be used as biomarkers for psychiatric disorder as well as a potential aid to diagnosis in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric aspects of Wilson disease: a review.", "Abstract": "To review the current evidence about psychiatric symptoms in Wilson's disease (WD).\nWe searched Ovid, PsychInfo, CINHAL and PubMed databases from May 1946 to May 2012 using the key words Wilson('s) disease in combination with psychiatry, psychiatric, psychosis, schizophrenia, depression, mania, bipolar, mood, anxiety, personality and behavior.\nPsychiatric symptoms occur before, concurrent with or after the diagnosis and treatment for WD. Thirty to forty percent of patients have psychiatric manifestations at the time of diagnosis, and 20% had seen a psychiatrist prior to their WD diagnosis. When psychiatric symptoms preceded neurological or hepatic involvement, the average time between the psychiatric symptoms and the diagnosis of WD was 864.3 days. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in WD patients varies wildly (major depressive disorder, 4-47%; psychosis, 1.4-11.3%). Certain gene mutations of ATP7B may correlate with specific personality traits.\nPsychiatric manifestations represent a significant part of the clinical presentation of WD and can present at any point in the course of the illness. Psychiatric manifestations occurring without overt hepatic or neurologic involvement may lead to misdiagnosis. A better understanding of the psychiatric presentations in WD may provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with major mental illness: a possible role for statins.", "Abstract": "To examine the need for and the possible benefits and risks of statin therapy in patients with major mental illness.\nPatients with psychiatric conditions, especially those with major mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are at increased risk of overweight, obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and the metabolic syndrome, all of which increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and mortality. The literature on the subject was qualitatively reviewed.\nPrimary prevention benefits with statins are well known in the general population of high-risk patients; recent evidence suggests that statins also carry primary prevention benefits in low-risk subjects. Regrettably, the primary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in psychiatry is a neglected area in clinical practice as well as in interventional research, whether in high- or in low-risk patients. Initial concerns notwithstanding, psychiatric complications do not appear to be important among the adverse effects of statins. Although statins are associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus, myopathy, and other untoward consequences, the risk-benefit ratio appears to favor statin use. The advisability of using statins in low-risk or medically healthy subjects remains debatable.\nOverweight, obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and the metabolic syndrome are common in patients with major mental illness, and these increase the risk of medical morbidity and mortality. Statin use should therefore be considered for the primary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in psychiatric patients, especially in those at high risk."}, {"Title": "Gender differences in coerced patients with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Despite the recent increase of research interest in involuntary treatment and the use of coercive measures, gender differences among coerced schizophrenia patients still remain understudied. It is well recognized that there are gender differences both in biological correlates and clinical presentations in schizophrenia, which is one of the most common diagnoses among patients who are treated against their will. The extent to which these differences may result in a difference in the use of coercive measures for men and women during the acute phase of the disease has not been studied.\n291 male and 231 female coerced patients with schizophrenia were included in this study, which utilized data gathered by the EUNOMIA project (European Evaluation of Coercion in Psychiatry and Harmonization of Best Clinical Practice) and was carried out as a multi-centre prospective cohort study at 13 centers in 12 European countries. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, social functioning and aggressive behavior in patients who received any form of coercive measure (seclusion and/or forced medication and/or physical restraint) during their hospital stay were assessed.\nWhen compared to the non-coerced inpatient population, there was no difference in sociodemographic or clinical characteristics across either gender. However coerced female patients did show a worse social functioning than their coerced male counterparts, a finding which contrasts with the non-coerced inpatient population. Moreover, patterns of aggressive behavior were different between men and women, such that women exhibited aggressive behavior more frequently, but men committed severe aggressive acts more frequently. Staff used forced medication in women more frequently and physical restraint and seclusion more frequently with men.\nResults of this study point towards a higher threshold of aggressive behavior the treatment of women with coercive measures. This may be because less serious aggressive actions trigger the application of coercive measures in men. Moreover coerced women showed diminished social functioning, and more importantly more severe symptoms from the \"excitement/hostile\" cluster in contrast to coerced men. National and international recommendation on coercive treatment practices should include appropriate consideration of the evidence of gender differences in clinical presentation and aggressive behaviors found in inpatient populations."}, {"Title": "Acute alcohol response phenotype in heavy social drinkers is robust and reproducible.", "Abstract": "In 3 previously published works (Brumback et\u00a0al., 2007, Drug Alcohol Depend 91:10-17; King et\u00a0al., 2011a, Arch Gen Psychiatry 68:389-399; Roche and King, 2010, Psychopharmacology (Berl) 212:33-44), our group characterized acute alcohol responses in a large group of young, heavy binge drinkers (n\u00a0=\u00a0104) across a variety of subjective, eye-tracking, and psychometric performance measures.\nThe primary goal of the current study was to directly replicate prior findings of alcohol response in heavy social drinkers (HD) in a second independent cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0104) using identical methodology. A secondary goal was to examine the effects of family history (FH) of alcohol use disorders (AUD) on acute alcohol response in both samples. Participants attended 2 randomized laboratory sessions in which they consumed 0.8\u00a0g/kg alcohol or a taste-masked placebo. At pre- and post-drink time points, participants completed subjective scales, psychomotor performance and eye-movement tasks, and provided salivary samples for cortisol determination.\nResults showed that the second cohort of heavy drinkers exhibited a nearly identical pattern of alcohol responses to the original cohort, including sensitivity to alcohol's stimulating and hedonically rewarding effects during the rising breath alcohol content (BrAC) limb, increases in sedation during the declining BrAC limb, a lack of cortisol response, and psychomotor and eye-tracking impairment that was most evident at peak BrAC. The magnitude and temporal pattern of these acute effects of alcohol in the second cohort were similar to the first cohort across all measures, with the exception of 3 eye-movement measures: pro- and antisaccade accuracy and antisaccade velocity. FH of AUD did not affect alcohol response in the first cohort, and this was replicated in the second cohort.\nIn sum, in 2 independent samples, we have demonstrated that HD display a consistent and reliable sensitivity to alcohol's subjective effects and impairment of eye-tracking and psychomotor performance, which is not affected by FH status. This acute alcohol response phenotype in heavy, frequent binge drinkers appears to be robust and reproducible."}, {"Title": "At the crossroads of anthropology and epidemiology: current research in cultural psychiatry in the UK.", "Abstract": "Cultural psychiatry research in the UK comprises a broad range of diverse methodologies, academic disciplines, and subject areas.

Bipolar disorders are often diagnosed and treated with a significant delay. The expansion of preventive measures for bipolar disorders aims at minimizing the substantial negative consequences associated with the disease. Some of the shared aspects of prevention in psychoses and bipolar disorders are that the first symptoms commonly appear during adolescence and early adulthood and that there is a symptomatic overlap between the disorders. To improve efforts to seek early help, public information about mental illness, low threshold services as well as cooperation between adult, child and adolescent psychiatry are needed for this target group. One differences is that psychotic symptoms play a minor role in bipolar disorders. Specific biological markers, such as disturbances of sleep and circadian rhythm and clinical characteristics, such as substance use and behavioral problems in childhood and youth supplement (subsyndromal) clinical symptoms in a multifactorial risk model. Besides severity and frequency of symptoms, specific periodic course patterns are crucial. Strategies of early intervention require a careful consideration of risks and benefits. Two aims should be distinguished: the improvement of current symptomatology and the prevention of conversion to bipolar disorder. Currently, studies evaluating risks and benefits of such interventions are first conducted. Expertise and resources for early recognition of psychoses and bipolar disorders should be pooled. Common standards are the basis for advancement and implementation of preventive strategies for bipolar disorders."}, {"Title": "Training of child and adolescent psychiatry fellows in autism and intellectual disability.", "Abstract": "Patients with autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability can be clinically complex and often have limited access to psychiatric care.

Two-year median hospital costs in the depressed group were A$4153 compared with A$1671 in participants free from depression (P<.001). In multivariate analysis, the presence of clinically significant depressive symptoms remained an independent predictor of higher cost [incident rate ratios (RR)=1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23-1.68] and was associated with being a high-cost user of health services (RR=2.04, 95% CI: 1.43-2.92).\nThe estimation of costs was solely based on the main diagnosis, potentially leading to underestimates of the real cost differences.\nHospital care cost was higher for older men with documented evidence of past depression than those without.

The prominent role of both thought (obsessions) and motor (compulsions) dysfunction in OCD place the condition at the border between the neurological and the psychiatric. This is supported by a growing body of literature that implicates structures in decision-making, reward, and action-selection circuits in the disorder. Here, we provide an overview of the neurocircuitry of OCD while reviewing the DBS literature to date for the condition. Results of DBS trials in treatment- resistant OCD have been remarkably similar, with clinical response rates in the range of 40-60%, despite the use of a diverse range of targets. These results imply that a common underlying circuit is being modulated, and moreover that there is room for improvement, and debate, in the development of an evidence-driven DBS treatment for this chronic, debilitating illness."}, {"Title": "Addiction is Not a Natural Kind.", "Abstract": "I argue that addiction is not an appropriate category to support generalizations for the purposes of scientific prediction.

Besides, there are specific abnormalities in perception and language. Typical symptoms are already present in early childhood. Traditionally autism has been regarded as a severe form of neurodevelopmental disorder which goes along with overtly abnormal language, learning difficulties and low IQ in the majority of cases. However, over the last decades, it has become clear that there are also many patients with high-functioning variants of ASD. These are patients with normal language at a superficial level of description and normal and sometimes above average intelligence. In high-functioning variants of the disease, they may run unrecognized until late in adult life. High-functioning ASD is associated with a very high prevalence of comorbid classical psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, ADHD, tics, psychotic symptoms or emotionally unstable syndromes. In many such cases, there is a causal relationship between ASD and the comorbid psychiatric conditions in that the specific ASD symptoms result in chronic conflicts, misunderstandings and failure in private and vocational relationships. These problems in turn often lead to depression, anxiety and sometimes psychosis-like stress reactions. In this constellation, ASD has to be regarded as a basic disorder with causal relevance for secondary psychiatric syndromes. In this paper, we summarize the classical presentation of high-functioning ASD in adult psychiatry and psychotherapy and suggest a nosological model to classify different ASD conditions instead.

Specifically, PTSD can be conceptualized as a disorder of fear and stress dysregulation, and the neural circuitry underlying these pathways in both animals and humans are becoming increasingly well understood. Furthermore, PTSD is the only disorder in psychiatry in which the initiating factor, the trauma exposure, can be identified. Thus, the pathophysiology of the fear and stress response underlying PTSD can be examined and potentially interrupted. Twin studies have shown that the development of PTSD following a trauma is heritable, and that genetic risk factors may account for up to 30-40% of this heritability. A current goal is to understand the gene pathways that are associated with PTSD, and how those genes act on the fear/stress circuitry to mediate risk vs. resilience for PTSD. This review will examine gene pathways that have recently been analysed, primarily through candidate gene studies (including neuroimaging studies of candidate genes), in addition to genome-wide associations and the epigenetic regulation of PTSD. Future and on-going studies are utilizing larger and collaborative cohorts to identify novel gene candidates through genome-wide association and other powerful genomic approaches.

While the field of biological psychiatry strongly advanced on macroscopic levels, current developments are rediscovering the richness of immunohistological information when attempting a multi-level systematic approach to brain function and dysfunction. For most studies, histology sections lost information on three-dimensional reconstructions. Translating histological sections to 3D-volumes would thus not only allow for multi-stain and multi-subject alignment in post mortem data, but also provide a crucial step in big data initiatives involving the network analyses currently performed with in vivo MRI. We therefore investigated potential pitfalls during integration of MR and histological information where no additional blockface information is available. We demonstrated that strengths and requirements from both methods can be effectively combined at a spatial resolution of 200 \u03bcm. However, the success of this approach is heavily dependent on choices of hardware, sequence and reconstruction. We provide a fully automated pipeline that optimizes histological 3D reconstructions, providing a potentially powerful solution not only for primary human post mortem research institutions in neuropsychiatric research, but also to help alleviate the massive workloads in neuroanatomical atlas initiatives.

However, parents do not parent, and children do not grow up, in isolation, but in multiple contexts, and one notable context of parenting and child mental health is culture. Every culture is characterized, and distinguished from other cultures, by deep-rooted and widely acknowledged ideas about how one needs to feel, think, and act as an adequately functioning member of the culture. Insofar as parents subscribe to particular conventions of a culture, they likely follow prevailing \"cultural scripts\" in childrearing. Broadening our definition, it is therefore the continuing task of parents also to enculturate children by preparing them for the physical, psychosocial, and educational situations that are characteristic of their specific culture. Cross-cultural comparisons show that virtually all aspects of parenting children are informed by culture: culture influences when and how parents care for children, what parents expect of children, and which behaviors parents appreciate, emphasize and reward or discourage and punish. Thus, cultural norms become manifest in the mental health of children through parenting. Furthermore, variations in what is normative in different cultures challenge our assumptions about what is universal and inform our understanding of how parent-child relationships unfold in ways both culturally universal and specific. This essay concerns the contributions of culture to parenting and child mental health. No study of a single society can address this broad issue. It is possible, however, to learn lessons about parenting and child mental health from the study of different societies."}, {"Title": "The problem of psychopathology and phenomenology. What is viable and not viable in phenomenological psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The epistemological underpinnings of psychiatric theory and practice have always been unstable. This reflects the essential contradiction existing between the task (the description and individuation of speech and behavior as psychopathological symptoms) and tools (semiotics). As a result of this contradiction, the history of psychiatry is one of permanent crisis in which there are moments of temporary stability as approaches that aim at organizing this mismatch between tasks and tools gain prevalence. However, these approaches can only offer a false sense of unity, consistency and progress. In this sense, a narrow perspective on a particular period may lead us to believe that psychiatry is just another medical specialty with its own specific theoretical framework like others. However, any such perspective overlooks the coexistence of different schools, disagreements, contradictions, global alternatives, etc. For a certain period of time, phenomenology was assumed to be as the solution for psychiatry&#8217;s internal contradiction. As we see it, phenomenology was only partially understood. Despite the great influence it exerted upon psychiatry worldwide, it finally fell into disuse as a mere empiricism. Husserl&#8217;s phenomenology was more thoroughly understood and better assimilated by other psychiatrists, and its influence has persisted to the present day. If we view phenomenology in its proper (Husserlian) sense, it is possible to understand psychopathology as a means of creating intelligibility and clarifying the uniqueness of psychiatry. On the other hand, if phenomenology is understood as a representational theory, it will eventually lead to an unavoidable relapse into psychologism, which has been the main path of psychiatry until now."}, {"Title": "A cross-sectional comparison of drinking patterns, alcohol use and related medical morbidities in a secondary versus tertiary setting.", "Abstract": "Alcohol Dependence exists in different spectrums at different settings and associated with various medical morbidities, disability and health care utilization costs.\nTo study the drinking patterns, alcohol use disorders and alcohol related medical morbidities in patients diagnosed with Alcohol Dependence Syndrome (ADS) and attending out / in-patient psychiatry services at secondary and tertiary care centre.\nA cross-sectional comparative study was done among the patients diagnosed with ADS attending psychiatry services at District hospital, Udupi and Kasturba Hospital, Manipal.

However, we do not know how multiple patient, hospital, and physician factors interact to determine LOS. Patient data were collected from a psychiatric hospital in Osaka, Japan. We developed subgroups, which were determined by interactions related to LOS using signal detection theory. In acute or emergency wards, five factors related to LOS were identified, and subjects were categorized into six subgroups. The indices obtained by the five factors ranged 2.49-3.47 for odds ratio, 0.47-0.84 for sensitivity, 0.40-0.76 for specificity, and 0.52-0.71 for positive predictive value.

In this transversal study, we assessed the liaison psychiatry impact that is still in development stage in Morocco. This study lasted 24 months, and was conducted at the University Hospital in Fez, Morocco.\nThe goal of this work was to evaluate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders managed by liaison psychiatry, identify those requiring medical and surgical departments of such psychiatric support, and classify the motivations involved in their needs.\nThis transversal study was initiated in January 2010 and has lasted 24 months. The study recruited 180 patients requiring psychiatric consultation from different medical and surgical departments at the University Hospital in Fes, Morocco. The psychiatric assessment was based on a psychiatric interview using the MINI. The data were collected by a certified psychiatrist using a questionnaire containing 24 items. After initial psychiatric assessment, the follow-up was proposed to the patient in the psychiatric department.\nDuring this study, 22 medical and surgical departments of our University Hospital had requested a psychiatric assessment for their patients. Most demands were respectively emitted by the Department of Dermatology (16%) and Nephrology (11%). The most common motivations for psychiatric consultations were respectively psychomotor agitation (17%) and an evaluation of suicide attempts (17%). Depressive and psychotic disorders were the most diagnosed disorders with 47% and 11% respectively. The psychiatric support was based on pharmacological treatment in 60% of cases. Finally, the outcome was favourable in 80% of followed cases.\nHospitalized patients in different medical and surgical departments of the University Hospital of Fez have demonstrated a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders.

Seventy-two percent of respondents reported some form of involvement with a psychiatrist on their palliative care service, with only 10% of those identifying a psychiatrist as a full- or part-time member of the team. Most respondents reported that they would like psychiatrists to be more involved with the palliative care services (71%). Secondary analyses of qualitative responses identified common impediments to increased psychiatry involvement, which included financial constraints, provider interest, and perceived disciplinary disconnect.\nThere are shared objectives between psychiatry and palliative care; however, currently, co-involvement on treatment teams is quite limited.

The creation of court-ordered treatment is based on the premise that many offenders have psychiatric disorders. If the court-ordered treatment is appraised as an effective way to prevent recidivism by the lawmaker, the preeminent role of psychiatry, in the prevention of recidivism has generated controversy in the psychiatric community. Few studies have been conducted on court-ordered treatment in France, and have concerned epidemiological measures. Court-ordered treatment leads to an extension of the expert's mission. In order to prevent recidivism, the interest of a treatment is a new part of the expert's mission.\nThe main purpose of this study was to assess the kind of diagnosis reported by the forensic psychiatrist who considered the court-ordered treatment as appropriate.\nWe led a descriptive and retrospective study among the experts' reports of 68\u00a0subjects followed by three psychiatrists. We categorized each diagnosis found in the experts' reports in reference to DSM-IV-TR axis\u00a0I and axis\u00a0II. As the expert has no obligation to refer to the DSM-IV-TR, we also considered the \"no DSM-IV-TR categorized disorder\" as a category. The primary outcome was the proportion of each diagnosis category in experts' reports, in which the forensic psychiatrist agreed with the indication of a court-ordered treatment.\nWe analysed 123\u00a0experts' reports in which the mission was to diagnose a mental disorder and to assess the need for a court-ordered treatment. The expert agreed with the need for a court-ordered treatment in 112\u00a0reports. In those reports the diagnosis was \"no disorder\" in 27% of them, \"no DSM-IV-TR categorized disorder\" in 26% of them, \"axis II disorder\" in 24% of them, \"axis I disorder\" in 19% of them, and \"association of an axis I and an axis II disorder\" in 4% of them.\nThe diagnoses were heterogeneous. Their associations with the need for a court-ordered treatment seem to be contradictory when considering the association between \"no mental disorder\" and \"need for a court-ordered treatment\" found in 27% of the reports. These paradoxical results led us to question the meaning of mental disorder and treatment."}, {"Title": "Increased serum prolactin levels in drug-naive first-episode male patients with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Prolactin is a hormone receiving considerable attention in psychiatry.

However, there is restricted numbers of investigations that researched baseline prolactin levels in first-episode patients with schizophrenia.\nWe purpose to investigate serum baseline prolactin levels in drug-naive first-episode patients with schizophrenia (FES) and to explore the differences in serum prolactin levels between FES, drug-free schizophrenic patients (DFS) and healthy controls (HC).\nThe study was conducted in the Departments of Psychiatry, G\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131 Hasvak and K\u0131rklareli State Hospitals, Turkey. Thirty male FES, 41 male DFS and 32 male HC were included in study. All participants were clinically examined and individually interviewed. Before initiating any pharmacological treatment, 5 ml of venous blood was collected to measure serum prolactin levels between 08:00 and 10:00 h, which was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Prolactin levels were also collected from the consenting HC using the same assay.\nThe mean age was higher in the DFS group. The mean score of Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale was higher in the FES group and mean score of Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms was higher in the DFS group. The mean value of prolactin was higher in the FES group (34.1 \u00b1 19.9 ng/dl) compared with DFS (17.9 \u00b1 6.5 ng/dl) and HC (9.7 \u00b1 2.3 ng/dl) (F = 35.5, P < 0.001). Additionally, the mean value of serum prolactin is higher in the DFS group compared with HC (P < 0.001).\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate higher serum prolactin levels in male FES compared with male DFS and male HC.

In recent years, it has become appreciated that the onset and development of these disorders goes beyond the one gene-one disease approach. Rather, the involvement of many genes is likely linked to these illnesses, and regulating the activation or silencing of gene function may play a crucial role in contributing to their pathophysiology. Epigenetic modifications such as histone acetylation and deacetylation, as well as DNA methylation can induce lasting and stable changes in gene expression, and have therefore been implicated in promoting the adaptive behavioral and neuronal changes that accompany each of these illnesses.

Poor employee wellbeing (i.e., high levels of burnout or low job satisfaction) is associated with poorer consumer outcomes and higher staff turnover. This study set out to examine factors related to job satisfaction, turnover intention and burnout in a group of occupational therapists in mental health.\nThirty-four occupational therapists (response rate approximately 60%) in a metropolitan public mental health service participated in a whole-of-service workforce survey. The survey included measures of job satisfaction, turnover intention, burnout, job hindrances, job challenges and job resources and questions about positive and negative aspects of positions and factors that attracted employees to their current position.\nBurnout was associated with lower job satisfaction and higher turnover intention. Higher job satisfaction was associated with rewards (remuneration and recognition) as well as cognitively challenging work. The variables most significantly associated with poorer wellbeing (higher turnover intention and burnout) were recipient contact demands (perception that contact with service users or families was demanding), and feelings of stress or fatigue.\nThis study provides a detailed analysis of factors associated with job satisfaction, turnover intention and burnout in a group of occupational therapists working in mental health. To promote workforce wellbeing and enhanced retention, interventions to minimise burnout should be implemented and evaluated. These strategies should focus on enhancing job resources such as supervisor support, feedback and participation in decision making as well as building the personal resilience of occupational therapists working in mental health."}, {"Title": "Increased coherence of white matter fiber tract organization in adults with Asperger syndrome: a diffusion tensor imaging study.", "Abstract": "To investigate whether there are global white matter (WM) differences between autistic and healthy adults, we performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 14 male adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) and 19 gender-, age-, and intelligence quotient-matched controls. We focused on individuals with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD), AS, to decrease heterogeneity caused by large variation in the cognitive profile. Previous DTI studies of ASD have mainly focused on finding local changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), two indexes used to characterize microstructural properties of WM. Although the local or voxel-based approaches may be able to provide detailed information in terms of location of the observed differences, such results are known to be highly sensitive to partial volume effects, registration errors, or placement of the regions of interest. Therefore, we performed global histogram analyses of (a) whole-brain tractography results and (b) skeletonized WM masks. In addition to the FA and MD, the planar diffusion coefficient (CP) was computed as it can provide more specific information of the complexity of the neural structure. Our main finding indicated that adults with AS had higher mean FA values than controls. A less complex neural structure in adults with AS could have explained the results, but no significant difference in CP was found.

An effectiveness study of a community-based intervention (EAAD).", "Abstract": "The suicide rate in Hungary is high in international comparison. The two-year community-based four-level intervention programme of the European Alliance Against Depression (EAAD) is designed to improve the care of depression and to prevent suicidal behaviour. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of a regional community-based four-level suicide prevention programme on suicide rates.\nThe EAAD programme was implemented in Szolnok (population 76,311), a town in a region of Hungary with an exceptionally high suicide rate. Effectiveness was assessed by comparing changes in suicide rates in the intervention region after the intervention started with changes in national suicide rates and those in a control region (Szeged) in the corresponding period.\nFor the duration of the programme and the follow-up year, suicide rates in Szolnok were significantly lower than the average of the previous three years (p\u200a=\u200a.0076). The suicide rate thus went down from 30.1 per 100,000 in 2004 to 13.2 in 2005 (-56.1 %), 14.6 in 2006 (-51.4 %) and 12.0 in 2007 (-60.1 %). This decrease of annual suicide rates in Szolnok after the onset of the intervention was significantly stronger than that observed in the whole country (p\u200a=\u200a.017) and in the control region (p\u200a=\u200a.0015). Men had the same decrease in suicide rates as women. As secondary outcome, an increase of emergency calls to the hotline service (200%) and outpatient visits at the local psychiatry clinic (76%) was found.\nThese results seem to provide further support for the effectiveness of the EAAD concept. Whilst the majority of suicide prevention programs mainly affect female suicidal behaviour, this programme seems to be beneficial for both sexes. The sustainability and the role of the mediating factors (social service and health care utilization, community attitudes about suicide) should be key points in future research."}, {"Title": "The NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Project: implications for genetics research.", "Abstract": "Heterogeneity of disorders, comorbidity across diagnoses, and reification of existing disease classifications are some of the challenges facing psychiatry in the twenty-first century.

This can be adequately reconstructed by focusing on the establishment of specialized journals, societies, university chairs, the invention and application of specific instruments, medical practices, and certainly also the publication of pivotal textbooks in the field. Particularly around 1900, the German-speaking countries played an integral role in this process. In this article, one aspect is extensively explored, notably the publication (in the twentieth century) of three comprehensive and influential multivolume and multiauthor handbooks entirely devoted to neurology. All available volumes of Max Lewandowsky's Handbuch der Neurologie (1910-1914) and the Handbuch der Neurologie (1935-1937) of Oswald Bumke and Otfrid Foerster were analyzed. The handbooks were then compared with Pierre Vinken's and George Bruyn's Handbook of Clinical Neurology (1968-2002). Over the span of nearly a century these publications became ever more comprehensive and developed into a global, encompassing project as is reflected in the increasing number of foreign authors. Whereas the first two handbooks were published mainly in German, \"Vinken & Bruyn\" was eventually published entirely in English, indicating the general changes in the scientific language of neurology after World War II. Distinctions include the uniformity of the series, manner of editorial involvement, thematic comprehensiveness, inclusion of volume editors in \"Vinken & Bruyn,\" and the provision of index volumes. The increasing use of authorities in various neurological subspecialties is an important factor by which these handbooks contrast with many compact neurological textbooks that were available at the time. For historiographical purposes, the three neurological handbooks considered here were important sources for the general study of the history of medicine and science and the history of neurology in particular. Moreover, they served as important catalyzers of the emergence of neurology as a new clinical specialty during the first decades of the twentieth century."}, {"Title": "Staff attitudes towards patients with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Stigmatizing attitudes have been reported in international studies among staff in psychiatry.

The scales have 16 questions to which another four questions were added by the authors.\nA total of 548 staff members answered the questions (61 doctors and 487 other professionals). The majority of the respondents believed in the possibility of recovery for patients and only a minority associated a high degree of dangerousness with schizophrenia. The cause of the illness was mainly regarded as being biological, but all agreed to a bio-psycho-social aetiological approach. The majority of the respondents believed that the illness was chronic and agreed on the need for staff to also be aware of patients' somatic illness. The doctors did not question their role as \"real doctors\" or the scientific basis for psychiatry. The majority would not mind working with a colleague with schizophrenia, but about half would hesitate to disclose if they themselves were diagnosed with the illness. Being a woman working in community psychiatry with long experience and participation in a recovery educational programme was associated with less stigmatizing attitudes.\nThe survey showed a relatively low level of stigmatizing attitudes.

Latin America has experienced a significant increase in transplant activity in recent decades, but there is a dearth of data regarding psychosocial issues following kidney transplantation. The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of depression and the demographic factors associated to depression among renal transplant recipients in Panama.\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted between March to May 2010 in a hospital setting during routine outpatient evaluations. The study included 119 renal transplant recipients (58 males, 61 females). Depressive symptoms were measured using the self-report Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and diagnoses were established by a trained psychiatrist using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Regression models were used to explore the association between depression and sociodemographic variables.\nThe prevalence of depression was 11.8% among transplant recipients. Linear regression indicated that the presence of an anxiety disorder, increasing age, and lower education levels were significantly and independently associated with depressive symptoms.

Resilience stands for one's capacity to recover from extremes of trauma and stress. Resilience in a person reflects a dynamic union of factors that encourages positive adaptation despite exposure to adverse life experiences. One needs to have a three-dimensional construct for understanding resilience as a state (what is it and how does one identify it?), a condition (what can be done about it?), and a practice (how does one get there?). Evaluating the level of resilience requires the measurement of internal (personal) and external (environmental) factors, taking into account that family and social environment variables of resilience play very important roles in an individual's resilience. Protection factors seem to be more important in the development of resilience than risk factors. Resilience is a process that lasts a lifetime, with periods of acquisition and maintenance, and reduction and loss for assessment. Overall, currently available data on resilience suggest the presence of a neurobiological substrate, based largely on genetics, which correlates with personality traits, some of which are configured via social learning. The major questions about resilience revolve around properly defining the concept, identifying the factors involved in its development and recognizing whether it is actually possible to immunize mental health against adversities. In the clinical field, it may be possible to identify predisposing factors or risk factors for psychopathologies and to develop new intervention strategies, both preventive and therapeutic, based on the concept of resilience. The preferred environments for application of resilience are health, education, and social policy and the right approach in integrating; it can be developed only with more research and analysis with focus on resilience. Be it patient or family member or caregiver, advocating resilience will empower psychiatrists in India."}, {"Title": "Law & psychiatry: Does the constitution require an insanity defense?", "Abstract": "Idaho is one of four states that have abolished the insanity defense. Hence, John Delling, on trial for two murders in Idaho, was unable to plead insanity or to argue that he lacked intent to kill, the only available option under Idaho law. After being sentenced to life in prison without parole, Delling challenged the constitutionality of Idaho's law. The state's supreme court rejected his appeal, holding that--despite the long history of the insanity defense and its widespread acceptance--there was no constitutional right to an insanity defense. Delling's petition to the U.S. Supreme Court was turned away, leaving the constitutional status of the insanity defense uncertain."}, {"Title": "[Biologism controversy: ethical implications for psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Current biological psychiatry, it is frequently claimed by its opponents, is \"biologistic\" and unduly narrows psychological disorders to neurobiology and molecular biology. They deem a complete neuroscientific reduction of the mental phenomena to be impossible because of the impossibility of reducing certain phenomena, such as the individual subjective experience. If such a reduction is nevertheless undertaken it is ultimately to the disadvantage of the patients. We argue in this article that the very term \"biologism\" has to be put under scrutiny in the first place. As a result it becomes obvious that \"biologism\", as a subclass of \"philosophical naturalism\", is ultimately quite unproblematic. Biologism is dangerous only if it implies an eliminative rejection or an inappropriate underestimation of the relevance of the psyche. On closer examination it gets evident that such implications do not follow necessarily from biologism but cannot be precluded either. To better identify and possibly prevent such dangers, a more differentiated terminology seems helpful."}, {"Title": "Substance use disorders among mentally ill patients in a General Hospital in Sri Lanka: prevalence and correlates.", "Abstract": "To determine the prevalence, and demographic and clinical correlates of substance use disorders among the mentally ill.\nCross sectional analytical study. Data were collected from consecutive patients treated at a Tertiary care Psychiatry Unit, Western Province, Sri Lanka using an interview schedule administered by a senior registrar in psychiatry.\nDiagnosis was based on ICD 10 criteria and the Clinician Rating Scale: Alcohol Use Scale (AUS) and the Drug Use Scale (DUS). The data were analysed using SPSS and WinPepi software programmes, utilising the chi squared, t test and median test.\nAmong a sample of 325 patients, 66% were male; 33% were diagnosed with depressive disorder, 30% with schizophrenia, 23% with bipolar affective disorder and 13% with other disorders. Prevalence of comorbid substance use disorders was 43% (95% CI 38 - 49%). Alcohol was the commonest type of substance used. Those who had a comorbid substance use diagnosis were more likely to be male, have a lower educational level, be unemployed and have a poorer level of social support. They were also found to have poorer treatment adherence, increased number of hospital admissions and an increased association with episodes of violence.\nA significant proportion of patients were found to have a comorbid substance use diagnosis and associated complications.

They differ in their clinical presentation and in their time course of major symptoms, which predominantly occurs for MR and ASD during childhood and for SCZ during young adult age. Recent findings with focus on the developmental neurobiology of these disorders emphasize shared mechanisms of common origin. These findings propose a continuum of genetic risk factors impacting on synaptic plasticity with MR causing impairments in global cognitive abilities, ASD in social cognition and SCZ in both global and social cognition.\nWe assess here the historical developments that led to the current disease concepts of the three disorders. We then analyse, based on the functions of genes mutated in two or three of the disorders, selected mechanisms shared in neurodevelopmental pathways and synaptic plasticity.\nThe analysis of the psychopathological constructs supports the existence of three distinct clinical entities but also elaborates important associations. Similarly, there are common mechanisms especially in global and social cognition.\nWe discuss implications from this integrated view on MR, ASD and SCZ for child & adolescent and adult psychiatry in pathophysiology and research perspectives."}, {"Title": "[National and international schizophrenia guidelines. Update 2013 regarding recommendations about antipsychotic pharmacotherapy].", "Abstract": "Treatment guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment to assist clinicians, care givers and patients in finding an optimized treatment option in given clinical situations. Specific treatment guidelines for schizophrenia issued by the German Association of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics (DGPPN) and published under the auspices of the Working Group for Scientific Medical Specialist Societies (AWMF) (i.e. fulfilling the highest quality standards at the S3 level) have been available in Germany since 2006. Currently, a comprehensive revision process is ongoing to update these guidelines with the aim to publish the revision before 2014. However, since publication of the German treatment guidelines many clinical trials and meta-analyses have been published which appear to make a new evaluation of antipsychotic drug treatment necessary. Currently available national and international guidelines, such as the WFSBP, PORT and NICE guidelines, place less emphasis on the general superiority of atypical antipsychotic medication but support the idea to evaluate antipsychotic drugs based on the side effect profiles. The present overview discusses the recent guidelines development processes regarding schizophrenia and compares the available German treatment guidelines with recently published international guidelines. Current developments and issues for discussion are described in detail to provide possible implications for changes in treatment recommendations."}, {"Title": "In Defence of Professional Judgement.", "Abstract": "A judgement is an assertion made with evidence or good reason in a context of uncertainty. In psychiatry the uncertainty is inherent in the professional context, and the evidence derives from the academic literature and scientific studies as they are applied to a specific patient. The nature of the uncertainty and the factors which should inform professional judgement are explored. Professional judgement is currently facing two serious challenges: an obsession with numbers, which comes from within medicine, and the 'patient choice' agenda, which is politically inspired and comes from outside medicine. This paper strives to defend professional judgement in the clinic against both challenges."}, {"Title": "Masters of their Conditions III: Clinical applications of theater anthropology in cultural psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Body learning gives actors basic structures and references that enable them to codify their actions in a script or score.

Molecular karyotyping using DNA microarrays is a new technology for diagnosis of genomic and chromosomal abnormalities in autism implemented in the fields of biological psychiatry and medical genetics. We carried out a comparative analysis of the frequency and spectrum of genome abnormalities in children with mental retardation and autism of unknown etiology using high-resolution comparative genomic methods for hybridization (HRCGH) and molecular karyotyping (array CGH). In a study of 100 children with autism, learning difficulties and congenital malformations by HRCGH, we identified genomic rearrangements in 46% of cases. Using array CGH we examined 50 children with autism. In 44 cases out of 50 (88%), different genomic abnormalities and genomic variations (CNV - copy number variations) were identified. Unbalanced genomic rearrangements, including deletions and duplications, were found in 23 cases out of 44 (52%). These data suggest that genomic abnormalities which are not detectable by common methods of chromosome analysis are often discovered by molecular cytogenetic techniques in children autism spectrum disorders. In addition, 54 children with idiopathic mental retardation and congenital malformations (31 boys and 23 girls) without autism spectrum disorders were examined using molecular karyotyping and microarray containing an increased number of DNA samples for genomic loci of chromosome X.

Issues such as validity, usefulness and acceptability of the diagnoses in this manual are increasingly debated. Several alternative possibilities have been suggested including: (i) the introduction of truly cross-cutting dimensional measures, that would facilitate dynamic multidimensional formulations of psychopathology, (ii) the Research Domain Criteria, that may facilitate biological research but move away from clinical symptoms, (iii) a system of personalized diagnosis based on psychopathology as a network of symptoms and contexts, and (iv) enhanced focus on motor alterations, other than catatonia, as a possible additional informative dimension of diagnosis in psychiatry, particularly as a possible marker of underlying neurodevelopmental alterations. We suggest that novel systems of diagnosis are likely to rely more on continuous monitoring of diagnostically relevant information in daily life, complementing retrospective symptom criteria in DSM and ICD. Patients and their families are likely to benefit from these projects, as novel models of diagnosis based on daily life information may be linked more strongly to treatment needs and prognosis."}, {"Title": "[The role of psychiatry in family violence treatment].", "Abstract": "The aim of the paper is reassessment of the role of psychiatry in the treatment of family violence within the context of contemporary approaches and researches.

We developed workflow models for a translational research study in psychiatry and the clinic where its data collection was carried out. After identifying points of dissonance between clinical and research models we derived a corresponding classification system that ultimately enabled us to re-engineer the data collection workflow. We considered (1) the number of patients approached for enrollment and (2) the number of patients enrolled in the study as indicators of efficiency in research workflow. We also recorded the number of dissonances before and after the workflow modification.\nWe identified 22 episodes of dissonance across 6 dissonance categories: actor, communication, information, artifact, time, and space. We were able to eliminate 18 episodes of dissonance and increase the number of patients approached and enrolled in research study trough workflow modification.\nThe classification developed in this study is useful for guiding the identification of dissonances and reveal modifications required to align the workflow of data collection and the clinical setting.

Furthermore, translational research on neuromodulation will allow us to glean something about the underlying cause of patient's illnesses before figuring out a treatment that addresses the source of the problem. Major depression offers perhaps the best example of the rapid progress being made in understanding the biology of mental illness. Studies on the underlying neurobiology of major depression have typically focused on the description of biological differences between patients and healthy subjects such as alterations of monoaminergic or endocrine systems. Psychotropic drugs work by altering neurochemistry to a large extent in widespread regions of the brain, many of which may be unrelated to depression. We believe that more focused, targeted treatment approaches that modulate specific networks in the brain will prove a more effective approach to help treatment-resistant patients. In other words, whereas existing depression treatments approach this disease as a general brain dysfunction, a more complete and appropriate treatment will arise from thinking of depression as a dysfunction of specific brain networks that mediate mood and reward signals (Berton and Nestler, Nat Rev Neurosci 7 (2):137-151, 2006; Krishnan and Nestler, Nature 455(7215):894-902, 2008). A better understanding of defined dysfunctions in these networks will invariably lead to a better understanding of patients afflicted with depression and perhaps contribute to a de-stigmatization of psychiatric patients and the medical specialty treating them."}, {"Title": "Main topics in transcultural psychiatric research in the Netherlands during the past decade.", "Abstract": "The population of the Netherlands has become increasingly diverse in terms of ethnicity and religion, and anti-immigrant attitudes have become more apparent. At the same time, interest in issues linked to transcultural psychiatry has grown steadily. The purpose of this article is to describe the most important results in Dutch transcultural psychiatric research in the last decade and to discuss their relationship with relevant social and political developments in the Netherlands. All relevant PhD theses (N\u2009=\u200927) between 2000 and 2011 were selected. Screening of Dutch journals in the field of transcultural psychiatry and medical anthropology and a PubMed query yielded additional publications. Forensic and addiction psychiatry were excluded from this review. The results of the review indicate three main topics: (a) the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and their relation to migration issues as social defeat and ethnic density, showing considerable intra- and interethnic differences in predictors and prevalence rates, (b) the social position of refugees and asylum seekers, and its effect on mental health, showing especially high risk among asylum seekers, and (c) the patterns of health-seeking behaviour and use of mental health services, showing a differentiated picture among various migrant groups. Anthropological research brought additional knowledge on all the above topics. The overall conclusion is that transcultural psychiatric research in the Netherlands has made a giant leap since the turn of the century. The results are of international importance and invite redefinition of the relationship between migration and mental health, and reconsideration of its underlying mechanisms in multiethnic societies."}, {"Title": "University psychiatry in Italy.

This report aims to provide an overview of the involvement of university medical schools in this process, considering their responsibility for teaching and training specialist practitioners and professionals.\nThe study was carried out between early 2010 and February 2011. An 18-items, self-administered, questionnaire was designed to investigate the number of faculty members that are responsible both for running a clinical ward and for providing communitybased healthcare.\nNine out of 53 faculty members (17%) manage a Mental Health Department, 9 (17%) manage a University Department, and 2 (3.8%) manage both types of department. Less than half of the teachers have full responsibility (hospital and community); however the percentage reaches 73.2% if we include the hospital wards open to the community emergencies. The remaining 26.8% have no responsibility for community psychiatry. Moreover there were undoubtedly still too many universities with specialisation schools that are without an appropriate network of facilities enabling them to offer complex psychiatric training.\nAs expected, there were several types of healthcare management that were not uniformly distributed throughout Italy and there were also marked differences between mental health care provision in the North, Centre, and South of Italy. The university involvement in clinical responsibility was great, but at the management level there was a lack of equality in terms of clinical care, which risks being reflected also on the institutional functions of teaching and research."}, {"Title": "Ethical considerations for evaluating the issue of physical restraint in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This article examines some of the ethical issues associated with the use of physical restraint in psychiatry and neurology. It offers no specific answers to individual operational problems, but a methodological matrix is proposed as an aid to experts in the various settings in which decisions are taken. The subject is addressed mainly by considering two sources: reference documents published by eminent organisations, and the theoretical framework of ethical values (or principles). A number of analytical criteria arising from these sources are then identified and proposed. The proposed criteria can be applied in cases for which the legitimate use of restraint may be an option, bearing in mind that restraint is an extremely serious affront to human dignity and is widely held to be of no therapeutic value. Its abuse is illegitimate in both ethical and legal terms."}, {"Title": "[Differences between patients in consultation psychiatry and psychiatric inpatients].", "Abstract": "To optimize psychiatric consultation service epidemiological information is needed.\nWe compared data on gender, age and diagnoses of patients in the consultation service to psychiatric inpatients.\nIn psychiatric consultation service patients are older (56.6 vs. 44.9 years, p\u200a<\u200a0.05) and males are older than females (58.8 vs. 54.4 years, p\u200a<\u200a0.05).

In the light of newer insights into neuroscience and molecular biology it is necessary to re-evaluate this issue. Since the medical model in previous decades was more of a confession rather than evidence based, one could assume that it is-due to scientific progress-currently becoming the one and only bedrock of psychiatry. This article argues that this would be a misapprehension of the normative constitution of the assessment of human behavior. The claim made here is twofold: First, whether something is a mental disease can only be determined on the mental level. This is so because we can only call behavior deviant by comparing it to non-deviant behavior, i.e., by using norms regarding behavior. Second, from this it follows that psychiatric disorders cannot be completely reduced to the physical level even if mental processes and states as such might be completely reducible to brain functions."}, {"Title": "Suicide-related events in young people following prescription of SSRIs and other antidepressants: a self-controlled case series analysis.", "Abstract": "We aimed to examine the temporal association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) prescriptions and suicide-related events in children and adolescents.\nSelf-controlled case series.\nElectronic health records were used from 479 general practices in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) UK primary care database from 1995 to 2009.\n81 young people aged 10-18 years with a record of completed suicide, 1496 who attempted suicide, 1178 with suicidal ideation and 2361 with intentional self-harm.\nIncidence Rate Ratios (IRRs) for completed and attempted suicide, suicidal ideation and intentional self-harm.\nFor non-fatal suicide-related behaviour, IRRs were similar for the time the person was prescribed either SSRIs or TCAs: IRRs increased during pre-exposure, peaked on prescription day, were stable up to the fourth prescription-week, and decreased after the prescriptions were stopped.

The purpose of this study was to describe the demographic, socio economic and clinical profile of the users at the child and adolescent mental health clinic of the Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital (RMMCH).\nA descriptive, retrospective clinical audit from users' clinical files was performed over a one-year period from January to December 2007. Descriptive statistical analyses of demographic and socio-economic variables were made and these variables were compared with the presenting clinical problems. Odds ratios were calculated for variables that showed a statistically significant association (p-value less than 0.05).\nA total of 303 users attended this clinic. Statistical comparisons between demographic data and disorders revealed that being male increased the likelihood of presenting with AHDH and disruptive behaviour disorders; being female increased the likelihood of being sexually abused. Race showed a significant association with parent-child relationship difficulties. Regarding socio-economic variables, the identity of the caregiver of the child influenced the risk of disruptive behaviour disorders, sexual abuse, neglect and academic problems. Where the child was placed was a risk factor for disruptive behaviour disorders, sexual abuse, neglect and academic problems. Whether the mother of a user was alive or deceased, was found to be related to ADHD and disruptive behaviour and whether the father of a user was alive or deceased, was found to be related to sexual abuse and academic problems. The education level of the caregiver showed a significant association with sexual abuse, neglect and academic problems; the marital status of the parent (widowed mother) showed a significant association with bereavement. Household income was associated with sexual abuse, neglect and academic problems.\nThis study demonstrated the impact that socio-economic circumstances have on the prevalence of childhood disorders; hence the urgent need for government and social welfare departments to improve the socio-economic status of communities. There is a need to improve psychiatric services for the population served by this hospital, including more clinics in its catchment area, as well as child psychiatry training posts and extended social work services."}, {"Title": "The National Football League and chronic traumatic encephalopathy: legal implications.", "Abstract": "The growing awareness of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has the potential to change the public perception and on-field rules of the National Football League (NFL).

Although most can be resolved by following the AAPL Ethics Guidelines and the AAPL Ethics Questions and Answers, the more complex ones inevitably have no easy solutions. Ethics-based duties can conflict without clear guidance on prioritization. Weighing competing factors necessitates more than merely following a rule, since there are potentially conflicting rules, and ethical practitioners may prioritize them differently. Concerns pertaining to the death penalty and defendants who are victims of discrimination are especially difficult. Such considerations usually are in the realm of aspirational ethics, with conclusions open to debate. They need consideration by most practitioners concerned with determining the most ethical course of action. Much as it is insufficient for an ethical citizen merely to avoid breaking the law, it is not enough to avoid violating any one guideline while remaining blind to context. Most such dilemmas need resolution long before testimony and arise first in the way the forensic assessment is conducted and in decisions on the data to be included in a report and how they are presented. Although there can be legitimate differences of opinion about how to weigh and resolve conflicting considerations, ethics-related dilemmas should not be sidestepped."}, {"Title": "The role of psycho-education in improving outcome at a general hospital psychiatry clinic in Uganda.", "Abstract": "While psychoeducation has been shown to positively affect outcomes in psychiatric disorders, its utility has been little studied in developing countries. The current study sought to examine the role of psychoeducation at a general psychiatric outpatient clinic in Kampala, Uganda in improving clinic attendance, treatment adherence, and clinical outcomes.\nA prospective case-control study using a quasi-experimental design was conducted in 117 patients suffering various psychiatric disorders. Participants were recruited for two months and then followed for a further three months after recruitment ended. Participants in the intervention group received formalized psychoeducation sessions at each clinic visit in addition to the usual psychiatric evaluation and care. Participants in the control group received the usual clinical care. Measured outcomes were knowledge of mental illness, compliance with medications and follow-up, and Clinical Global Impression (CGI).\nThe groups did not differ with respect to sociodemographic characteristics or attendance at scheduled follow-up visits. Both groups significantly improved on the CGI, but with no significant difference between the groups. However, the intervention group was more likely to adhere to medication, and their knowledge of mental illness was significantly higher at follow-up.\nThese data suggest that psychoeducation is a beneficial mental health intervention in a developing country that may increase compliance with medication and result in greater knowledge of mental illness. However, other factors such as distance from a centralized clinic or cost of treatment may impact outcomes, including attendance at scheduled follow-up visits."}, {"Title": "Use of interactive teaching techniques to introduce mental health training to medical schools in a resource poor setting.", "Abstract": "There are currently no practising psychiatrists in Somaliland.

Informal feedback informed a flexible teaching package. Assessment tools designed specifically for this course included a pre and post course MCQ exam and an OSCE. Changes in students' attitudes were evaluated using a questionnaire administered before and after the course. In addition, a questionnaire administered following the course evaluated the changes students perceived in their knowledge and attitudes to mental health.\nThe MCQ improved from 50.7% pre course to 64.4% post course (p = 9.73 E-08).

The aim of this article is to examine the current pathways to psychiatric care in Italy.\nWe used a method developed in the World Health Organization international collaborative studies to investigate pathways to care in 15 Italian mental health centers. We recruited 420 patients with a psychiatric illness and explored the care pathways they took to reach to psychiatric services and the delays from the onset of illness to reaching psychiatric care.\nThe majority of patients (33.8%) had direct access to mental health care, whereas the others arrived to a specialist in psychiatry through general hospitals (20.3%), general practitioners (33.0%) or private practitioners (9.8%). The main diagnosis for referral was neurotic disorder (36.6%), followed by affective disorder (35.4%) and psychotic disorder (11.5%). The delay from onset of illness to psychiatric care was greater for patients with psychotic disorders than for those with affective and neurotic disorders. The most frequently prescribed treatments were pharmacotherapy (56%), psychological support (8%), and psychotherapy (7.0%); 15% of the patients received no treatment.\nOur multicenter study shows that although general practitioners and hospital doctors are still the main referral point for mental health care, a greater proportion of patients are first seen in private settings or directly reach mental health centers, compared to previous surveys conducted in Italy.

This has been long needed in psychiatry, where treatment options have been empirical and treatment choices have been made largely based on clinical judgment. The efficacy and tolerability of antidepressants, the most common drugs used in mood disorders, have been widely studied in pharmacogenetics. Genetic association studies have been reported for pharmacokinetic genes such as the CYP450 isoenzymes or MDR1, and pharmacodynamic genes such as the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) or the serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A). However, despite the large number of reports, clinically useful predictors are still scarce for antidepressant monotherapy. Pharmacogenetic predictors of efficacy for mood stabilizers such as lithium and anticonvulsants have not had a dissimilar fate, and clinically meaningful markers are yet to emerge. The lack of consistent results may be in part due to small samples of heterogeneous populations and lack of consensus on phenotype definitions. Current pharmacogenetic recommendations include testing for HLA-B*1502 when using carbamazepine in Asian ancestry populations to prevent Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome, CYP2D6 genotypes when using pimozide, and CYP2D6 in polypharmacy to minimize drug interactions.

There has been marked scientific interest in sleep for a century, with the discoveries of the electrical activity of the brain (EEG), sleep-wake system, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and circadian rhythm system. Additionally, the advent of video-polysomnography in clinical research has revealed some of the consequences of disrupted sleep and sleep deprivation in psychiatric disorders. Decades of clinical research have demonstrated that sleep disorders are intimately tied to not only physical disease (e. g., lifestyle-related disease) but psychiatric illness. According to The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (2005), sleep disorders are classified into 8 major categories: 1) insomnia, 2) sleep-related breathing disorders, 3) hypersomnias of central origin, 4) circadian rhythm sleep disorders, 5) parasomnias, 6) sleep-related movement disorders, 7) isolated symptoms, and 8) other sleep disorders. Several sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, sleepwalking, REM sleep behavior disorder, and narcolepsy, may be comorbid or possibly mimic numerous psychiatric disorders, and can even occur due to psychiatric pharmacotherapy. Moreover, sleep disorders may exacerbate underlying psychiatric disorders when left untreated. Therefore, psychiatrists should pay attention to the intimate relationship between sleep disorders and psychiatric symptoms. Sleep psychiatry is an academic field focusing on interrelations between sleep medicine and psychiatry. This mini-review summarizes recent findings in sleep psychiatry. Future research on the bidirectional relation between sleep disturbance and psychiatric symptoms will shed light on the pathophysiological view of psychiatric disorders and sleep disorders."}, {"Title": "[Lessons from addiction psychiatry].", "Abstract": "In this paper, I would like to share my experience of helping to establish treatment systems for alcohol dependence in hospital and community settings during the period of relatively inadequate alcohol-dependence care in the 1970s. In the hospital-based treatment system, it was important to ensure that information on the patient's condition and course of treatment was shared with colleagues. It was also important to nurture the patient's compliance with treatment decisions, and involve family members in the treatment process. To promote the rehabilitation of the patient back into the community, it was vital to develop a network of staff in relevant hospitals, clinics, health centers, and welfare offices. Self-help groups also played an important role in rehabilitation. The systems we developed for the treatment of alcoholics offer many instructive lessons for the care of patients with other psychiatric disorders. Alcohol dependence and depression share many common symptoms and biological mechanisms. In consequence, studies on the biological basis of alcohol dependence can provide insights into biological mechanisms underlying other psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "[Toward reconsideration of involuntary treatment system in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The guardian system depending on families in the mental health and welfare act is expected to be revised in the near future.

On admission, she weighed 24.8 kg and her body mass index was 9.6 kg/m2. Treatment on a medical ward was not possible due to her resistance to being fed and repeated secretive and deviant behaviors. Therefore, she was treated mainly on a psychiatric ward, with a psychiatrist as the attending doctor. After hospitalization for more than 3 years, she had sufficiently recovered to leave the hospital. She was discharged weighing 37.7 kg and her body mass index was 14.5 kg/m2. As physical complications, the patient manifested with a tracheoesophageal fistula, duodenal bulb perforation, and tension pneumothorax, which were considered to reflect the vulnerability of the intrapleural and intraperitoneal soft tissue. She also manifested with lower limb edema, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, overreaction to a diuretic, dehydration, and hypernatremia, which were considered to reflect the disturbances of water balance. As seen in this case, a patient with anorexia nervosa who resists being fed, even though treatment of the physical complications requires an improved nutritional status above all, may require treatment on a psychiatric ward even at the risk of providing less than ideal care for the physical complications. We discuss \"medical psychiatry\" as a model for treating anorexia nervosa patients with severe physical complications. In this concept of \"medical psychiatry\", it is the most important that staff on the psychiatric ward take an interest in and have concerns about the patient's physical complications. If the psychiatrist as the attending doctor actively and continuously participates in the treatment of physical complications, it should be possible to create a treatment plan that, although complex due to its multidisciplinary nature, is followed smoothly and consistently, and, therefore, provide patients with trustworthy and appropriate medical treatment."}, {"Title": "Psychodermatology: an overview.", "Abstract": "Psychodermatology is an interface between dermatology and psychiatry.

We think that DSM widely determines the scientific and clinical orientation of the discipline, and therefore provides a good vantage point to critique the current psychiatric methodology. The main scientific problem is a perseverative attempt at validating descriptively defined disorders that are standardized and simplified to achieve diagnostic reliability. Lack of a single psychiatric phenomenon that is valid, i.e. natural, for initiating any reduction limits research to inductive-probabilistic methods, basically correlational analyses. Furthermore, reduction in psychiatry is typically directed at basic sciences, neglecting general medical diagnoses as possible intermediary correlates. The subcategory \"Due to a General Medical Condition\" is elusive, and the biopsychosocial approach does no more than strengthen the brain-disease illusion surrounding DSM definitions by justifying psychiatry as a branch of medicine while failing to stipulate detailed medical assessment and discouraging psychopathology-based clinical reasoning. It is therefore no surprise that, although our understanding of the neural basis and mechanisms of behavior has improved along with advances in the neurosciences, not a single DSM disorder has been validated by the discovery of a specific cause, pathophysiology, or structural abnormality since the adoption of the descriptive approach in 1980. New knowledge involves single traits or dimensions of mood, thought, or behavior, none of which are specific to any disorder. The optimum approach today would be to redefine the discipline as neuropsychiatry."}, {"Title": "Computer-aided psychotherapy based on multimodal elicitation, estimation and regulation of emotion.", "Abstract": "Contemporary psychiatry is looking at affective sciences to understand human behavior, cognition and the mind in health and disease.

Therefore, this paper presents multidisciplinary research results of Laboratory for Interactive Simulation System at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb in the stress resilience. Patient's distortion in emotional processing of multimodal input stimuli is predominantly consequence of his/her cognitive deficit which is result of their individual mental health disorders. These emotional distortions in patient's multimodal physiological, facial, acoustic, and linguistic features related to presented stimulation can be used as indicator of patient's mental illness. Real-time processing and analysis of patient's multimodal response related to annotated input stimuli is based on appropriate machine learning methods from computer science. Comprehensive longitudinal multimodal analysis of patient's emotion, mood, feelings, attention, motivation, decision-making, and working memory in synchronization with multimodal stimuli provides extremely valuable big database for data mining, machine learning and machine reasoning. Presented multimedia stimuli sequence includes personalized images, movies and sounds, as well as semantically congruent narratives. Simultaneously, with stimuli presentation patient provides subjective emotional ratings of presented stimuli in terms of subjective units of discomfort/distress, discrete emotions, or valence and arousal. These subjective emotional ratings of input stimuli and corresponding physiological, speech, and facial output features provides enough information for evaluation of patient's cognitive appraisal deficit.

Unfortunately, psychiatric texts and the educational process in psychiatry training do not adequately address the combined approach. There is a lack of information concerned with the psychological aspect of prescribing medications. This is striking since many patients require both treatments. There is an inevitable psychological aspect of the administration of medication in psychiatry, and the meaning ascribed to the prescription of drugs has an impact on doctor-patient relationship. Understanding the psychodynamic issues is crucial for the success of psychopharmacology. Psychodynamic psychopharmacotherapy represents an integration of biological psychiatry and psychodynamic insights and techniques. This approach recognizes that many of the core discoveries of psychoanalysis are powerful factors in the complex relationship between the patient, the illness, the doctor, and the medications. Scientific pharmacotherapy is, as it should be, based upon patients' responses to treatments of specific target conditions. Enduring personality traits are being increasingly incorporated as targets for pharmacotherapy. However, in the real world of psychiatric practice we see that transference issues and a patient's character or set of personality traits have a greater impact on the selection, dosage, tolerability, and treatment outcome than is generally recognized or admitted. In contemporary psychiatry, a psychodynamic perspective must be preserved.

Ten of the 22 persons in this subgroup had been committed in forensic psychiatric inpatient care and later discharged. The same number of persons had been sentenced to prison and subsequently released after the previous forensic mental examination.\nWhile primary prevention of crime for the larger population of all patients with psychosis is not feasible, secondary prevention (prevention of reoffending) might be possible by focusing on the small subgroup, which had undergone a previous forensic mental examination. Obligatory follow-up and treatment in outpatient care would probably decrease recidivistic offending among discharged forensic psychiatric patients and among those offenders found not guilty by reason of insanity but not considered to fulfill criteria for involuntary hospital treatment."}, {"Title": "The third wave of biological psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In this article I will argue that we are witnessing at this moment the third wave of biological psychiatry. This framework conceptualizes mental disorders as brain disorders of a special kind that requires a multilevel approach ranging from genes to psychosocial mechanisms. In contrast to earlier biological psychiatry approaches, the mental plays a more prominent role in the third wave. This will become apparent by discussing the recent controversy evolving around the recently published DSM-5 and the competing transdiagnostic Research Domain Criteria approach of the National Institute of Mental Health that is build on concepts of cognitive neuroscience. A look at current conceptualizations in biological psychiatry as well as at some discussions in current philosophy of mind on situated cognition, reveals that the thesis, that mental brain disorders are brain disorders has to be qualified with respect to how mental states are constituted and with respect to multilevel explanations of which factors contribute to stable patterns of psychopathological signs and symptoms."}, {"Title": "Cyborg psychiatry to ensure agency and autonomy in mental disorders. A proposal for neuromodulation therapeutics.", "Abstract": "Neuromodulation therapeutics-as repeated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and neurofeedback-are valuable tools for psychiatry. Nevertheless, they currently face some limitations: rTMS has confounding effects on neural activation patterns, and neurofeedback fails to change neural dynamics in some cases. Here we propose how coupling rTMS and neurofeedback can tackle both issues by adapting neural activations during rTMS and actively guiding individuals during neurofeedback. An algorithmic challenge then consists in designing the proper recording, processing, feedback, and control of unwanted effects. But this new neuromodulation technique also poses an ethical challenge: ensuring treatment occurs within a biopsychosocial model of medicine, while considering both the interaction between the patients and the psychiatrist, and the maintenance of individuals' autonomy. Our solution is the concept of Cyborg psychiatry, which embodies the technique and includes a self-engaged interaction between patients and the neuromodulation device."}, {"Title": "Sleep disturbances in a clinical forensic psychiatric population.", "Abstract": "Poor sleep is known to cause detrimental effects on the course of diverse psychiatric disorders and is a putative risk factor for hostility and aggression. Thus, sleep may be crucial in forensic psychiatric practice. However, little is known about the prevalence of sleep disturbances in these complex psychiatric patients.\nIn this study we investigated the presence of sleep disorders and subjective sleep quality using the Sleep Diagnosis List (SDL), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), interviews addressing the causes of sleep complaints, and file information on sleep medications in 110 patients admitted to a forensic psychiatric hospital.\nAlmost 30% of the participants suffered from one or more sleep disorders, especially insomnia. An even larger proportion of the participants (49.1%) experienced poor sleep quality. Interestingly, patients with an antisocial personality disorder or traits were particularly dissatisfied with their sleep. The most common causes of sleep problems were suboptimal sleep hygiene, stress or ruminating, negative sleep conditioning, and side effects of psychotropic medication. Of the poor sleepers, 40.7% received a hypnotic drug.\nDespite intensive clinical treatment, sleep problems are experienced by a large number of forensic psychiatric patients. It would be worthwhile to examine the effects of pharmacological and non-pharmacological sleep interventions on both psychiatric symptoms and reactive aggressive behavior in forensic patients."}, {"Title": "History, background, concepts and current use of comedication and polypharmacy in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Based on a careful literature search a review is presented of the history, background, concepts and current use of comedication and polypharmacy in psychiatry.

This study investigates this trend and discusses its likely impact on the quantity and quality of medical care available.\nData on licensed physicians and new licenses issued to physicians were taken from a Ministry of Health database, and analyzed by gender, age, academic origin (Israeli graduates, immigrants, Israeli-born who studied abroad), and specialty for the years 1999-2011.Data on employed physicians, their population group, and work hours were taken from the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) annual Labour Force Survey for the years 2009-2011.\nThe proportion of women amongst physicians aged under 65 rose from 38% in 1999 to 42% in 2011, and was even higher for younger physicians. The highest proportion of females is found amongst new immigrant physicians who studied abroad. The corresponding proportion has been rising steadily amongst Israeli-educated physicians, and is lowest amongst Israeli-born physicians who studied abroad.Similarly, among newly licensed physicians, the proportion of females has traditionally been highest among immigrants who studied abroad and lowest among Israeli-born graduates who studied abroad. Among newly-licensed physicians who studied in Israel, the proportion of females has historically been intermediate between the other two groups, but it has recently risen to 54% and now parallels the proportion of females among immigrants who studied abroad. In recent years, the mix of academic origins among newly licensed physicians has changed dramatically, with important implications for the proportion of women among newly licensed physicians.The highest percentage of females was found in family medicine followed by oncology, pediatrics and psychiatry. The greatest increase over the years in this percentage was for gynecology and internal medicine.Female physicians worked shorter hours than males, particularly at younger ages. The proportion of females among employed Arab physicians is much lower than among Jewish physicians.\nThe proportion of female physicians has been steadily rising, although in recent years the increase has leveled off. This has been due, in part, to the decline in the flow of immigrant physicians and the increase in the number of Israelis studying abroad. Future developments in medical education options and immigration will determine whether their proportion will continue rising.

Although guidelines are available, clinical practice is often guided by experience and there is little agreement on which drugs should be first-line treatment for rapid tranquilisation. This study aimed to investigate sedation for ABD in an acute mental healthcare unit, including the effectiveness and safety of high dose sedation.\nA prospective study of parenteral sedation for ABD in mental health patients was conducted from July 2010 to June 2011. Drug administration (type, dose, additional doses), time to sedation, vital signs and adverse effects were recorded. High dose parenteral sedation was defined as greater than the equivalent of 10 mg midazolam, droperidol or haloperidol (alone or in combination), compared to patients receiving 10 mg or less (normal dose). Effective sedation was defined as a fall in the sedation assessment tool score by two or a score of zero or less. Outcomes included frequency of adverse drug effects, time to sedation/tranquilisation and use of additional sedation.\nParenteral sedation was given in 171 cases. A single drug was given in 96 (56%), including droperidol (74), midazolam (19) and haloperidol (3). Effective sedation occurred in 157 patients (92%), and the median time to sedation was 20 min (Range: 5 to 100 min). The median time to sedation for 93 patients receiving high dose sedation was 20 min (5-90 min) compared to 20 min (5-100 min; p = 0.92) for 78 patients receiving normal dose sedation. Adverse effects occurred in 16 patients (9%); hypotension (14), oxygen desaturation (1), hypotension and oxygen desaturation (1). There were more adverse effects in the high dose sedation group compared to the normal dose group [11/93 (12%) vs. 5/78 (6%); p = 0.3]. Additional sedation was given in 9 of 171 patients (5%), seven in the high dose and two in the normal dose groups.\nLarge initial doses of sedative drugs were used for ABD in just over half of cases and additional sedation was uncommon. High dose sedation did not result in more rapid or effective sedation but was associated with more adverse effects."}, {"Title": "Clinical and Demographic Profile of Attendees at Baghdad's Walk-in Psychiatric Clinic.", "Abstract": "Few studies have examined clinical and demographic profile of attendees of a walk-in psychiatric clinic in countries ravaged by wars.

In his teaching, he used artistic representations from previous centuries to illustrate the historical developments of hysteria, mainly with the help of his pupil Paul Richer. Charcot liked to draw portraits (in particular, sketches of colleagues during boring faculty meetings and students' examinations), caricatures of himself and others, church sculptures, landscapes, soldiers, etc. He also used this skill in his clinical and scientific work; he drew histological or anatomic specimens, as well as patients' features and demeanor. His most daring artistic experiments were drawing under the influence of hashish. Charcot's tastes in art were conservative; he displayed no affinity for the avant-gardes of his time, including impressionism, or for contemporary musicians, such as C\u00e9sar Franck or Hector Berlioz. L\u00e9on Daudet, son of Charcot's former friend and famous writer Alphonse Daudet, described Charcot's home as a pseudo-gothic kitsch accumulation of heteroclite pieces of furniture and materials.

A cognitive-behavioural therapy or schema-focused model was felt to be best suited to inform CF in PD offenders. No agreement was achieved on the assessment of quality of CF.\nOur findings support the government's PD strategy in that experts agreed that CF could be performed by professionals other than psychiatrists and psychologists. However, more research is needed on how to best assess the quality of CF and its utility in determining treatment pathways.\nIt may be possible for probation staff to take on a more active role in CF for PD offenders using a cognitive-behavioural or schema-focused model.

Two cases are presented from an evaluation study in a psychiatric hospital. In both cases, the nurses follow the intervention protocol, but the outcome is different. In the first case, the patient ends up in the seclusion room. In the second case, this does not happen. Analyzing the cases from a care ethics perspective, we conclude that applying the intervention in the right way implies more than following the steps laid down in the protocol. It requires a new way of thinking and acting, resulting in new relationships between nurses and patients. Care ethics theory can help clarify what good care is actually about and keep in mind what is needed to apply the intervention.

The bank was affiliated in 1994 as a member of the National Network of Brain Banks and also focuses on schizophrenia and healthy control tissue. Alcohol abuse is a major problem worldwide, manifesting in such conditions as fetal alcohol syndrome, adolescent binge drinking, alcohol dependency, and alcoholic neurodegeneration. The latter is also referred to as alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD). The study of postmortem brain tissue is ideally suited to determining the effects of long-term alcohol abuse, but it also makes an important contribution to understanding pathogenesis across the spectrum of alcohol misuse disorders and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases. Tissue from the bank has contributed to 330 peer-reviewed journal articles including 120 related to alcohol research. Using the results of these articles, this review chronicles advances in alcohol-related brain research since 2003, the so-called genomic age. In particular, it concentrates on transcriptomic approaches to the pathogenesis of ARBD and builds on earlier reviews of structural changes (Harper et\u00a0al.

There are currently 145 medical schools in Brazil, the highest concentration being in the more developed areas. In 2005, there were 6,003 psychiatrists working in Brazil, a rate of 3.3 psychiatrists per 100,000 inhabitants, with unequal distribution across the geographical regions of the country: a rate of 4.5 psychiatrists/100,000 inhabitants in the southern region, and less than one psychiatrist per 100,000 inhabitants in the northern region. The south and south-east regions comprise 56% of the national population and 76% of the residency posts in psychiatry. In 2013, 27% of the residency posts in psychiatry were not filled, particularly in the north and north-east areas, where the shortage of professionals is more pronounced. The number of specialized doctors is far below what is needed to cover the burden attributed to neuropsychiatric disorders in the country. The main hypotheses to explain this imbalance in Brazil are the relatively low exposure to the speciality during undergraduate course work, the stigma attached to mental disorders, and the poor organization of mental healthcare services."}, {"Title": "Recruitment and training of psychiatrists in Hong Kong: what puts medical students off psychiatry--an international experience.", "Abstract": "The Hospital Authority employs over 60,000 staff and manages 41 public hospitals and institutions, 47 specialist outpatient clinics and 74 general outpatient clinics throughout Hong Kong.

The role of premedical and medical factors on career choice in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Despite the high prevalence of mental disorders, a worldwide shortage of psychiatrists exists. Moreover, the number of students interested in choosing psychiatry as their future profession is low and psychiatry is frequently regarded as one of the least wanted medical specializations. We report the findings of a cross-sectional quantitative survey of final year Croatian medical students as part of the International Survey of Student Career Choice in Psychiatry (ISoSCCiP). The questionnaire consisted of three sections: socio-demographic factors, psychiatric education during medical school, and attitudes and personality characteristics. Out of 200 students, 122 completed the questionnaire (response rate 61%). The overall student evaluation of the compulsory psychiatry curriculum was 'average'. Significantly higher ratings were reported by students who attended special psychiatry teaching modules, or felt more involved in the teaching of the subject. Poor evaluation of medical school psychiatric education significantly increased the likelihood of not choosing psychiatry as a future career. The choice of psychiatry was also predicted by attitudes towards psychiatry and by personal characteristics. In conclusion, student ratings of medical school psychiatric education and involvement in teaching appear to influence choice towards psychiatry.

We attempt to address this burning issue by examining medical student's attitudes towards psychiatry and factors influencing their career choice in the Czech Republic. In 2010, 71 students in their last year of medical school at the First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague were recruited in this quantitative cross-sectional online study. From the sample, 16% (n = 11) of students were considering psychiatry as a career path. An important factor in choosing psychiatry as a career path was personal/family presence of mental illness. Longer experience with psychiatry placement also contributed to the choice of psychiatry, as well as participation in elective courses or psychiatric research projects. Students considering psychiatry were less systematic compared to the group not considering psychiatry. Low reported levels of recruitment to psychiatry present a problematic issue in the Czech Republic. To make psychiatry more appealing to medical students, proactive steps by the relevant stakeholders need to be implemented. These strategies should include steps such as allocating more time for psychiatry in the medical curriculum, better quality of lectures, and the inclusion of additional elective courses."}, {"Title": "Encouraging French medical students to choose a career in psychiatry: how and why?", "Abstract": "There is an increasing demand for psychiatrists in France. This paper reviews the reasons for French medical students choosing psychiatry and the rationale and mechanisms for encouraging them towards this medical speciality. The main factors associated with choosing psychiatry as a career are the quantity and quality of undergraduate training and placements in psychiatry, better attitudes towards psychiatry and more emphasis on a positive life/work balance. The quality of postgraduate training can also influence students' decisions. Medical students should be encouraged to choose psychiatry first to counterbalance the existing stigma towards mental illness within the society, but also towards psychiatry within the medical profession, and second because of the current decline in French medical demography. Ways to improve recruitment are a selection process that favours a large number of psychiatric trainees, and an increase in the quality and quantity of training. Providing medical students with relevant information about training in psychiatry, notably through a national trainees' association, will not only improve the quality of care by increasing recruitment in psychiatry, but also ensure that all future doctors are familiar with and develop positive attitudes towards mental health issues."}, {"Title": "International study of student career choice in psychiatry (ISoSCCiP): results from Modena, Italy.", "Abstract": "Italy was one of the 16 countries to take part in the International Study of Student Career Choice in Psychiatry (ISoSCCiP).

Paradigms which have represented the foundations of psychiatry in the last century now need a major revision. In particular, both trainees in psychiatry and early career psychiatrists need to (1) (re)discover psychopathology, (2) improve mental healthcare through integrated treatments, (3) identify and treat new syndromes, (4) promote an image of psychiatry with patients at the heart of care and as advocates for each other by fighting stigma and promoting the recruitment in psychiatry by medical students.

A total of 31 students (13%) said they would like to be psychiatrists while 44 (18%) were neutral and 170 (69%) did not want to become psychiatrists. The factors that made psychiatry interesting for the students included the view that the problems presented by psychiatric patients were often particularly interesting and challenging and the fact that mental illness presented the field of medicine with one of the greatest challenges. Discouraging factors articulated by the students included views that psychiatry was a vague and speculative speciality, psychiatry was not an important part of the curriculum in medical schools, and psychiatric patients tend to make more emotional demands on their doctors than other patients. There was a negative view of psychiatric patients who most of the students thought were strange, dangerous and incurable, although they were curious to know more about them. Most of the negative influence in psychiatry is due to the misconceptions that students have about its prestige and scope, the rewards it offers in terms of job satisfaction and opportunities and the negative views towards psychiatric patients.

Negative opinions on psychiatry among medical students have been associated with various matters, such as problems with scientific soundness, stigma, prestige and financial incentives. It has been reported that these negative opinions could be reversed by clinical exposure, improved knowledge base and increased affiliation with the field. Unfortunately, reversed attitudes do not have permanency. Considering that there has not been any study focusing on recruitment problems in Turkey, we attempted to provide a perspective by reporting the results of our study conducted with Turkish medical students. Attractive qualities of psychiatry were of particular interest. We found that brain research, neuroscience, philosophy, psychotherapy and academics are main areas of interest in psychiatry.

A review of factors before and during medical school.", "Abstract": "Potential psychiatrists decide on their careers before, during or after medical school. This article summarises the literature focusing on the first two groups. Pre-medical school factors associated with choosing psychiatry include gender, academic aptitude, ethnicity and migration, exposure to mental illness, economic considerations and medical school route and selection. Factors involved in influencing career choice at medical school level include attitudes towards psychiatry, teaching methods, quality and length of clinical exposure, electives and enrichment activities, and personality factors. Considering these factors may improve recruitment to psychiatry and address shortages in the speciality."}, {"Title": "Research into recruitment: critical gaps in the literature.", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to systematically review the literature available internationally on recruitment into psychiatry.

The notion of \"controllable lifestyle (CL) specialties,\" defined by work hours and income, is gaining in popularity. As a result, many reports advocate providing a 'lifestyle-friendly' work environment to attract medical graduates. However, little has been documented about the priority in choosing specialties across the diverse career opportunities.This nationwide study was conducted in Japan with the aim of identifying factors that influence specialty choice. It looked for characteristic profiles among senior students and junior doctors who were choosing between different specialties.\nWe conducted a survey of 4th and 6th (final)-year medical students and foundation year doctors, using a questionnaire enquiring about their specialty preference and to what extent their decision was influenced by a set of given criteria. The results were subjected to a factor analysis. After identifying factors, we analysed a subset of responses from 6th year students and junior doctors who identified a single specialty as their future career, to calculate a z-score (standard score) of each factor and then we plotted the scores on a cobweb chart to visualise characteristic profiles.\nFactor analysis yielded 5 factors that influence career preference. Fifteen specialties were sorted into 4 groups based on the factor with the highest z-score: \"fulfilling life with job security\" (radiology, ophthalmology, anaesthesiology, dermatology and psychiatry), \"bioscientific orientation\" (internal medicine subspecialties, surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, emergency medicine, urology, and neurosurgery), and \"personal reasons\" (paediatrics and orthopaedics). Two other factors were \"advice from others\" and \"educational experience\". General medicine / family medicine and otolaryngology were categorized as \"intermediate\" group because of similar degree of influence from 5 factors.\nWhat is valued in deciding a career varies between specialties. Emphasis on lifestyle issues, albeit important, might dissuade students and junior doctors who are more interested in bioscientific aspects of the specialty or have strong personal reasons to pursue the career choice. In order to secure balanced workforce across the specialties, enrolling students with varied background and beliefs should be considered in the student selection process."}, {"Title": "Improving residents' performance on the PRITE: is there a role for peer-assisted learning?", "Abstract": "The authors implemented a peer-assisted learning approach to prepare residents for the Psychiatry Resident-In-Training Examination (PRITE), with the goal of increasing test performance.\nThe authors developed a PRITE review curriculum utilizing a peer-assisted learning approach.

As an initial step in supporting residents as teachers, a baseline self-assessment of residents' knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values related to teaching was conducted among psychiatry and family medicine residents to compare and improve their confidence and skills as teachers.\nPsychiatry residents (N=12) and family medicine residents (N=23) completed self-assessments of their knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values related to teaching. Residents also were asked to list steps used in the One-Minute Preceptor process and estimate the time each spent in teaching. Descriptive summary statistics were used for four main areas related to teaching; t-test and chi-square analyses were conducted to ascertain whether there was a significant difference in resident groups.\nIn the current study, the perceived amount of time spent for teaching patients was significantly higher among family practice residents, whereas no group differences were found for time teaching medical students, peers, community members, non-physicians, or others. However, family medicine residents rated themselves higher than psychiatry residents in their understanding of their roles in teaching medical students and teaching patients. Also, family medicine residents' self-reported teaching skills were more advanced (82.4%) than psychiatry residents' (54.2%). They most likely applied at least two different teaching methods in inpatient and outpatient settings, as compared with psychiatry residents. No significant group differences were found in the other 15 items assessing teaching knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values.\nResults indicate that residents' knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values regarding teaching varies across institutions and training programs. The psychiatry residents in this study do not clearly understand their role as educators with patients and medical students; they have a less clear understanding of teaching techniques, and report spending less time educating patients than do family medicine residents. The differences might be due to different patient populations and treatment settings. The study suggests that psychiatry residents may have difficulty adapting the One-Minute Preceptor technique in psychiatric settings.

Participants characterized their program's child welfare training curriculum and indicated their awareness of selected child welfare information and training resources.\nIn all, 68% of program directors responded; 90% of respondents indicated that their residents encounter child welfare-involved youth very frequently or frequently. Just over half of the respondents reported inadequate training materials, and half were aware of at least one of the three queried child welfare information resources. However, nearly 40% of respondents who were familiar with the queried child welfare resources still reported having inadequate training materials. Respondents with adequate training materials were more likely to classify their program as devoting enough time to child welfare training. Respondents at sites that spent less than 5 hours on non-didactic child welfare training during residency were more likely to indicate that not enough time was spent on training.\nThe findings of this study suggest that increasing child psychiatry program director awareness of existing child welfare information resources and providing 6-or-more hours of non-didactic child welfare training, two feasible and relatively low resource actions, may improve child welfare training in child psychiatry residencies."}, {"Title": "Team-based learning for psychiatry residents: a mixed methods study.", "Abstract": "Team-based learning (TBL) is an effective teaching method for medical students.

The present review briefly describes the background of this novel treatment modality and summarizes evidence from clinical trials into the efficacy of rTMS for depression and hallucinations. Evidence for efficacy in depression is stronger than for hallucinations, although a number of studies have reported clinically relevant improvements for hallucinations too. Different stimulation parameters (frequency, duration, location of stimulation) are discussed. There is a paucity of research into other psychiatric disorders, but initial evidence suggests that rTMS may also hold promise for the treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.

The first part of the article explores how 'autism' was used as a category to describe hallucinations and unconscious fantasy life in infants through the work of significant child psychologists and psychoanalysts such as Jean Piaget, Lauretta Bender, Leo Kanner and Elwyn James Anthony. Theories of autism were then associated both with schizophrenia in adults and with psychoanalytic styles of reasoning. The closure of institutions for 'mental defectives' and the growth in speech therapy services in the 1960s and 1970s encouraged new models for understanding autism in infants and children. The second half of the article explores how researchers such as Victor Lotter and Michael Rutter used the category of autism to reconceptualize psychological development in infants and children via epidemiological studies. These historical changes have influenced the form and function of later research into autism and related conditions."}, {"Title": "Vestibular insights into cognition and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The vestibular system has traditionally been thought of as a balance apparatus; however, accumulating research suggests an association between vestibular function and psychiatric and cognitive symptoms, even when balance is measurably unaffected. There are several brain regions that are implicated in both vestibular pathways and psychiatric disorders. The present review examines the anatomical associations between the vestibular system and various psychiatric disorders. Despite the lack of direct evidence for vestibular pathology in the key psychiatric disorders selected for this review, there is a substantial body of literature implicating the vestibular system in each of the selected psychiatric disorders. The second part of this review provides complimentary evidence showing the link between vestibular dysfunction and vestibular stimulation upon cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. In summary, emerging research suggests the vestibular system can be considered a potential window for exploring brain function beyond that of maintenance of balance, and into areas of cognitive, affective and psychiatric symptomology. Given the paucity of biological and diagnostic markers in psychiatry, novel avenues to explore brain function in psychiatric disorders are of particular interest and warrant further exploration."}, {"Title": "A Canadian perspective on documentary film: Drug Addict.", "Abstract": "In 1948 the first National Film Board (NFB) documentary in Canada about illegal drugs, trafficking, and addiction was produced. The documentary is titled Drug Addict, and was directed by Robert Anderson. This paper provides a socio-historical context for the documentary Drug Addict. Viewing the film through the lens of Canadian history gives readers a better context to understand the claims and representations in the film about law enforcement, people who use illegal drugs and treatment.\nTo examine Drug Addict, a socio-historical analysis and case study were conducted. This project's qualitative methodological framework is consistent with its critical theoretical perspective, drawing from Stuart Hall's perspectives on visual and textual representation and cultural criminology.\nDrug Addict is a significant documentary because it provides insight into early foundational law enforcement discourses and practices about illegal drugs, addiction, and treatment, including obstacles to drug substitution and maintenance programs. It also highlights the emergence of psychiatry as a new knowledge producer in the area of drug treatment. The film also transmits ideas about the criminal nature of addicts and the need for punitive criminal justice control.\nDrug Addict captures some past and contemporary tensions related to Canadian drug policy. The film also provides another lens to understand some of the foundational frameworks of Canadian drug policy such as the dominance of criminal justice, and its practices of knowledge production, the resistance espoused by institutions to diverse models of treatment such as drug maintenance programs, and the power of visual representation."}, {"Title": "The state of the service: a survey of psychiatry resident education in psychosomatic medicine.", "Abstract": "Although required by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, training of general psychiatry residents in Psychosomatic Medicine (PM) varies significantly between programs.

Since then, there has been no assessment of the status of PM training during psychiatry residency.\nAssessment of the current state of PM training in U.S. psychiatry residency programs.\nA 46-item questionnaire was sent via e-mail to 206 residency directors. Four major areas were assessed: the timing and duration of the PM rotation, level of faculty supervision, didactic curriculum, and role (or potential role) of the APM in residency education.\nNinety-two surveys were returned (response rate 45%). Forty-four (54%) of the general psychiatry residencies reported the total duration of the C-L rotation as being between 3 and 6 months (including both full- and part-time rotation). Only 38 (46%) programs' residents complete their PM experience in 1 year of residency. The average Full-Time Equivalent of teaching faculty per service was 1.74 (standard deviation 0.92).

Data on HMI in India is scarce. This retrospective chart review aimed to evaluate socio-demographic, socio-cultural and clinical profile of HMI patients, and to study reasons of homelessness and outcome related variables in these patients. One hundred and forty homeless persons were admitted to the department of psychiatry of a north Indian medical university from February 2005 to July 2011. Of these, one hundred and twenty-seven (90.7%) had psychiatric illness and six had only intellectual disabilities. The majority of HMI persons were illiterate/minimally literate, adult, male, and from low socioeconomic and rural backgrounds. Most of the patients (55.7%) had more than one psychiatric diagnosis. HMI had considerably high rates of co-morbid substance abuse (44.3%), intellectual disabilities (38.6%) and physical problems (75.4%). Most (84.3%) were mentally ill before leaving home and 54.3% left home themselves due to the illness. Most HMI responded to the treatment. After treatment of mental illness, it was possible to reintegrate about 70% of the patients into their families. Families were willing to accept and support them.

SOC gained attention recently in the fields of psychiatry after it was reported to be associated with a lowered risk of various health problems. However, the effect of SOC as a buffer against performance impairment caused by health problems is not well known. Thus, we aimed to examine the relationships among health problem, the degree of presenteeism (performance loss due to health problems), and SOC in adolescents.\nParticipants were 2824 university students (1855 males, mean age; 18.35\u00b10.84 years). SOC and self-reported health problems were assessed using an SOC scale (29 items) and the presenteeism scale for students, respectively.\nSOC scores differed between students with and without health problems (t(2822)=5.75, P<0.001). The effect size (Cohen's d) was 0.22 for this difference. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, male gender (odds ratio [OR]=0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.53-0.73), moderate SOC (within \u00b11 SD; OR=0.59; 95% CI=0.47-0.72), and high SOC (>1 SD; OR=0.43; 95% CI=0.33-0.58) were independently associated with a lower frequently of health problems. In addition, SOC showed a significant inverse correlation with presenteeism (r=-0.27, P<0.001).\nThese results suggest that application of the concept of SOC might aid in the prevention of health problems among university students. Students with a strong SOC might be less prone to a decline in performance when health problems arise."}, {"Title": "[Collective violence: neurobiological, psychosocial and sociological condition].", "Abstract": "Collective violence, despite its often disastrous consequences has widely been disregarded by psychiatry, as was the case for individual violence. Physical violence is not only an individual, mostly male phenomenon but manifests mainly as collective violence among men in multiple forms. Due to the plentitude of theories and findings on collective violence the present article is limited to a few relevant sociological and neurobiological aspects of collective violence as a group and intergroup phenomenon. A special focus is given to the association of the phylogenetic disposition to group violence and constructions of masculinity, to the potential relevance of mirror neurons for social contagion and to the influence of sociostructural factors for male adolescents joining violence-prone groups. In this context group dynamics such as in-group overevaluation and out-group devaluation are of central importance by stabilizing the male sense of self-worth and legitimizing, normalizing and internalizing violent behavior. Instead of mythologizing, biologizing or banalizing violence, transdisciplinary approaches are necessary to improve violence prevention on different ecological levels being obligated to a culture of nonviolent conflict management."}, {"Title": "Tamoxifen and depression: drug interactions in breast cancer.", "Abstract": "This case describes a 76-year-old African-American female with a history of depression, breast cancer, and hypothyroidism admitted to the inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit for an electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) evaluation.

The most striking example of clinical morbidity associated with PTSD is the well-known increase in the risk of suicidal behavior. Given that PTSD and medical illnesses increase the likelihood of suicide separately and independently, it is reasonable to suggest that the risk of suicidal behavior differs between patients suffering from PTSD comorbid with medical illnesses and patients having either condition alone. The available data point toward a novel clinical notion, an altered risk of suicidal behavior in patients suffering from comorbid PTSD and medical illnesses. This area of overlap between medicine and psychiatry is still in its infancy, with many unanswered questions about the rate, patterns and psychobiological mechanisms of suicidal behavior in this patient population. The positive association between PTSD, medical illness and suicidal behavior that appears to exist in the adult population, most likely affects the pediatric population as well. Closer investigation into the significance of the association between chronic medical illnesses, PTSD and suicidality in children, adolescents and adults is necessary."}, {"Title": "[Violence in residential care: a retrospective study from a psychotraumatological perspective].", "Abstract": "Commissioned by the victims-organisation 'Wei\u00dfer Ring', we conducted 130 interviews (34% female, 66% male, medium age of 53.6 years) during a period of 12 months (March 2011-March 2012). All of them reported that they had been traumatised children in residential care (1946-1975: 70%, 1976-1990: 25%). The interviews primarily aimed at providing expert estimates of the consequences of individual traumas in order to establish a valid basis for compensation. The later evaluation of the interviews allows insight in to forms and quantity of subjective experiences of trauma and of their consequences for later life; although-due to the sampling procedures-no reliable generalisations about the entire system of Social Pedagogy of the City of Vienna are possible. All 130 one-hour long, clinical-biographic interviews were conducted by the same expert (who has qualifications in general and in adolescent psychiatry).\n98.5% report experiences of psychic, 96.2% of bodily and 46.9% of sexual violence. 45.5% also report some positive experiences (independent of the form of experienced violence). There are significantly more reports about the frequency of physical violence during 1946-1975, however not about other forms of violence than from the later years. Problems in later life emerge more frequently after experiences of sexual violence, such as instable career trajectories, instable partnerships, psychopathological symptoms and severe turbulences in one's life history. The experiences of physical violence correlate significantly higher with instable career trajectories and (not significantly) with criminal tendencies. The frequency of later psychiatric care is related to the length of time spent in residential care (but not significantly)."}, {"Title": "Deep brain stimulation: lessons learned in 25 years and future ahead.", "Abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a major advancement in the field of functional neurosurgery in the last century.

The results of this study show that the people of Chosun realized the need to sterilize mental patients because they considered mental patients very violent, dangerous and eugenically inferior and they believed that mental patients would eventually impede the prosperity of Chosun. The people of colonial Chosun had learned about the lifelong mental hygiene movement, which had knowledge of mental illness prevention. However, they also recognized that people who developed mental illness despite efforts to prevent such condition needed help from the modern system, especially from modern Western psychiatry. The primary responsibility to attend to mental patients was imposed on their family. The family had to understand the symptoms of mental illness according to the modern medical classification and how to deal with them. When the family could not afford to take care of its mentally ill family member due to the increase in the member's risk behavior such as frenzied-convulsive excitement, paranoia and delusion of jealousy, the family was also responsible for isolating him and connecting him with a mental hospital. The police and social workers were also responsible for observing and monitoring mental patients in their community and for connecting them with a mental hospital. The police made a list of mental patients within their area of jurisdiction and prohibited them from wandering based on the law. It was also considered desirable for mental patients who could not identify their family members to be sent to a mental hospital. Social workers were responsible for managing mental patient sanatoriums, and district commissioners sent to the police mental patients who had no family to look after them or who posed a threat to others, or else commissioned them to the government hospital. Thus, the final responsibility for mental patients was imposed on the modern Western medical team, because the district commissioners sent them to the police and the police sent them to the government mental hospital. Most educated people and government personnel in the colonial era thought modern Western psychiatry circles were responsible for mental patient management, and the Japanese empire enacted mental-healthrelated laws and made efforts to secure funds for the establishment of mental hospitals. As the literature at that time also show the position of the modern Western medical circle, their ambivalent attitude to mental patients must also be clarified to interpret the modern approach to treating mental patients in colonial Chosun. In this context, a research on historical figures in Japanese psychiatry, a study on the specific treatment methods used by the modern Western psychiatric team in the colonial era and their effects, and the extension of the subject period for such researches are suggested."}, {"Title": "Facility based cross-sectional study of self stigma among people with mental illness: towards patient empowerment approach.", "Abstract": "Self stigma among people with mental illness results from multiple cognitive and environmental factors and processes.

This paper is based on a dissociative cult, the Kiyang-yang (KYY), in Guinea Bissau. In a previous article, we used a refined definition of the concept of idiom of distress to analyze the dissociative behavior displayed in KYY as a symbolic language addressing politically dangerous truths. This paper uses the concept of \"collective trauma processing\" to analyze how the idiom offered the local population a pathway to mitigate the consequences of protracted and widespread political violence. The paper first argues that the field of psychotraumatology lacks a comprehensive ecological theory on trauma. Moreover, within clinical psychology and psychiatry, little attention is paid to local cultural healing mechanisms addressing traumatic stress. This paper is an effort to study such mechanisms in their own right. To compare trauma processing mechanisms across the globe, we propose to analyze trauma processing mechanisms with the help of a comprehensive model discerning five ontological dimensions that are considered to be involved in suffering and are addressed in healing approaches. Our paper describes similarities and differences between psychological healing traditions and collective trauma processing within the West African context of Guinea Bissau. We will illustrate how the KYY movement uses the idiom of dissociation as both a collective expression of distress and as a vehicle to process social suffering and traumatic stress as a circular phenomenon."}, {"Title": "Awareness of venous thromboembolism in mental health services for older people.", "Abstract": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important safety issue in the inpatient mental health care of older people.

Results show that a majority of PU-PH (78%) were willing to maintain a single training pathway including adult psychiatry and child psychiatry with a single diploma, with the addition of a DESC (specific and additional Diploma) in forensic psychiatry (72%) and old age psychiatry (62%). Almost all respondents suggested the implementation of an assessment of teaching and a formal mentorship program. Some aspects of training included more controversial issues: such as the length of the training, the opening of training to private practice physicians, or the European harmonization.\nThe survey stressed some areas of improvement: such training in psychotherapy and research, access to supervision as well as barriers to improved training including an insufficient number of academic practitioners.

This study aimed to describe a sample of non-agenarians and centerians attending an old age psychiatry service with a focus on pharmacotherapy.\nRetrospective, cross-sectional survey of patients aged >90 in contact with the Department of Old Age Psychiatry in a university hospital over a 1-year period. Results were compared with the Beers, the Canadian and Screening Tool of Older Persons' potentially inappropriate Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria.\nA total of 65 nonagenarians or centerians were identified (mean age 93, 82% female). The majority (65%) resided in a nursing home; dementia was the most common diagnosis (77%), followed by depression (29%). The most commonly prescribed psychotropics were antidepressants (58%), followed by antipsychotics (45%), hypnotics (42%), anti-dementia agents (31%) and anxiolytics (26%). Overall, patients were on a mean of 2.1 (S.D. 1.3, range 0-5) psychotropics and 4.99 (S.D. 2.7, range 0-11) non-psychotropics. Mean Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 15 (S.D. 8.1). Increasing anticholinergic burden was negatively associated with MMSE scores (B = -1.72, p = 0.013). Residing in a nursing home was associated with a higher rate of antidepressant [OR 5.71 (95% CI 1.9-17.4)], anxiolytic [OR 13.5 (95% CI 1.7-110.4)] and antipsychotic [OR 3.4 (95% CI 1.1-10.4)] use.

Psychiatric assessment was performed in 142 patients by the Department of Psychiatry. The data contained in medico-legal reports and patient records were then examined with respect to patients' age, gender, nature of traumatic events, psychiatric diagnoses, descriptive characteristics of the patients, severity of trauma and past history of mental disorder and trauma experience. Results of the medicolegal evaluations were also analyzed.\nOf the 142 patients, 80 (56.3%) were female and their average age was 40.30\u00b117.17 years. The most frequent traumatic events were traffic accidents (29.6%) and violence-related blunt force trauma (28.9%). When the distribution of the most common psychiatric diagnoses was examined, it was found that anxiety disorders were found in 69 cases (48.6%), adjustment disorders were found in 16 cases (11.3%) and mood disorders were found in 12 cases (8.5%). Among anxiety disorders, acute stress disorder (n=39) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (n=27) were the most common ones. In 27 cases of the 142, it was determined that, psychiatric symptoms and findings did not meet the diagnostic criteria of any psychiatric disorder. Diagnosis of psychiatric disorder was not significantly related with traumatic experiences, comorbidity, marriage status, education level or lack of health insurance.\nWe assume elucidating the presence of a psychological trauma is crucial not only for the health benefit but also for legal rights of the patient.

The number of male patients who were involuntarily hospitalized was higher than the number of female patients. Most of the patients in the involuntary hospitalized group were graduates of primary school, were not married and were not working at the time of hospitalization. Schizophrenia was the most common diagnosis in the involuntarily hospitalized psychiatric patients and these patients needed longer stay in the hospital. The next hospitalization of the involuntarily hospitalized patients was mostly involuntary.\nMost of the involuntarily hospitalized psychiatric inpatients were male, were not working and had the diagnosis of schizophrenia.

It is recognized that depression/anxiety causes physical changes, including insomnia, anorexia, and bladder dysfunction. We aimed to delineate bladder dysfunction in patients with depression/anxiety by reviewing the literature. We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify the frequency, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), urodynamic findings, putative underlying pathology, and management of bladder dysfunction in patients with depression/anxiety. From a recent survey of a depression cohort (at a psychiatry clinic), the frequency of bladder dysfunction in depression is lower (up to 25.9%) than that in Parkinson's disease (up to 75%) and stroke (up to 55%), whereas it is significantly higher than that in age-matched controls (around 10%). In both the depression cohort and the psychogenic bladder dysfunction cohort (at a urology clinic), the most common LUTS was overactive bladder (OAB), followed by difficult urination and infrequent voiding. Compared with severe LUTS, urodynamic findings were dissociated; i.e. urodynamic findings were normal except for increased bladder sensation without detrusor overactivity for OAB (50% of all patients), followed by underactive detrusor without post-void residual for difficult urination. The effectiveness of serotonergic or anti-cholinergic medication for ameliorating OAB in the patients awaits further study. In conclusion, although the frequency of LUTS among the depression cohort is not elevated, depression/anxiety is obviously a risk factor for OAB. This finding presumably reflects that the bladder is under emotional control. Amelioration of bladder dysfunction is an important target in treating patients with depression/anxiety."}, {"Title": "[Schizotypical Disorder or Schizophrenia?

A merger of hospitals is an effort to increase and rationalize this production. Decisions behind a merger are made at the top leadership level. How this might be done is demonstrated by examples from a 36 bed acute psychiatric facility. The aim of the study was to calculate the hidden costs of fragmented destruction of parts of a total hospital supply to patients after a merger. Fragmented destruction is the deliberate stopping of activities deemed not part of the core activities of the hospital without due consideration of the impact on core activities. The proposed changes to operational expenses at a single acute psychiatric hospital were materials for the study. The changes included activities as a reduction in local laboratory service, cleaning services, closure of physiotherapy unit, closing of cultural activities and reduced productivity. The selected activities are calculated as giving an imputed gain of \u20ac 630,000 as indicated by the leadership. The not calculated costs of reducing or removing the selected activities are estimated at \u20ac 1,955,640. The cost of staff disappointment after a merger is difficult to assess, but is probably higher than assumed in the present calculations. Imputed cost containment is not attained. The calculations indicate that implemented changes may increase cost, contrary to the belief of the leadership at both the hospital level and further up in the hospital trust. Arguments in favor of a merger have to be scrutinized thoroughly for optimistic neglect of uncalculated costs of mergers.

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), from embryonic origin (hESCs) or induced from adult somatic cells (iPSCs), represent an opportunity to study the role of miRNAs in the earliest steps of human neurogenesis in both physiological and pathological contexts. Robust protocols are now available to convert pluripotent stem cells into several sub-types of fully functional neurons, recapitulating key developmental milestones along differentiation. This provides a convenient cellular system for dissecting the role of miRNAs in phenotypic transitions critical to brain development and plasticity that may be impaired in neurological diseases with onset during development. The aim of this review is to illustrate how hPSCs can be used to recapitulate early steps of human neurogenesis and summarize recent reports of their contribution to the study of the role of miRNA in regulating development of the nervous system."}, {"Title": "The subjective experience of community treatment orders: patients' views and clinical correlations.", "Abstract": "There is little objective evidence to support the use of community treatment orders (CTOs) from randomized controlled trials.

Here, we extracted 1,174 primary outcomes appearing in 82 meta-analyses published in health-related biological and behavioral research sampled from the Web of Science categories Genetics & Heredity and Psychiatry and measured how individual results deviated from the overall summary effect size within their respective meta-analysis. We found that primary studies whose outcome included behavioral parameters were generally more likely to report extreme effects, and those with a corresponding author based in the US were more likely to deviate in the direction predicted by their experimental hypotheses, particularly when their outcome did not include additional biological parameters. Nonbehavioral studies showed no such \"US effect\" and were subject mainly to sampling variance and small-study effects, which were stronger for non-US countries. Although this latter finding could be interpreted as a publication bias against non-US authors, the US effect observed in behavioral research is unlikely to be generated by editorial biases. Behavioral studies have lower methodological consensus and higher noise, making US researchers potentially more likely to express an underlying propensity to report strong and significant findings."}, {"Title": "High rate of suicide attempt and associated psychological traits in an isolated tribal population of North-East India.", "Abstract": "Cases of suicide documented earlier all over the world reflect the presence of suicide behavior in primitive world at a higher rate compared to general urban population.

Both classic, episodic BD and SMD are severe mood disorders characterized by deficits in processing emotional stimuli. Neuroimaging techniques can be used to test whether the pathophysiology mediating these deficits are similar across the two phenotypes. Amygdala dysfunction during face emotion processing is well-documented in BD, but little is known about amygdala dysfunction in chronically irritable youth. We compared neural activation in SMD (n=19), BD (n=19), and healthy volunteer (HV; n=15) youths during an implicit face-emotion processing task with angry, fearful and neutral expressions. In the right amygdala, both SMD and BD exhibited greater activity across all expressions than HV. However, SMD and BD differed from each other and HV in posterior cingulate cortex, posterior insula, and inferior parietal lobe. In these regions, only SMD showed deactivation in response to fearful expressions, whereas only BD showed deactivation in response to angry expressions.

The objective of this population-based study is to uncover practical insights regarding patients with 1 or more chronic illnesses. A cross-sectional investigation was designed to gather data from health records drawn from diverse US geographic markets. A database of 9.74 million fully-insured, working individuals was used, together with members in the same households. Among nearly 3.43 million patients with claims, 2.22 million had chronic conditions. About 24.3% had 1 chronic condition and 40.4% had multi-morbidity. Health care expenditures for chronic conditions accounted for 92% of all costs (52% for chronic costs and 40% for nonchronic costs). Psychiatry, orthopedics-rheumatology, endocrinology, and cardiology areas accounted for two thirds of these chronic condition costs; nonchronic condition costs were dominated by otolaryngology, gastroenterology, dermatology, orthopedics-rheumatology conditions, and preventive services. About 50.1% of all households had 2 or more members with chronic conditions. In summary, multi-morbidity is prevalent not only among those older than age 65 years but also in younger and working individuals, and commonly occurs among several members of a household. The authors suggest that the disease-focused model of medicine should change to a more holistic illness-wellness model, emphasizing not only the physical but also the mental and social elements that can influence individual health. In that way the chronic care model could be broadened in context and content to improve the health of patients and households."}, {"Title": "[An analysis of impact factor of Chinese Journal of Internal Medicine from 2008 to 2010].", "Abstract": "To analyze the articles and citation published in the Chinese Journal of Internal Medicine from 2008 to 2010, in order to investigate the influence factors of impact factor (IF).\nAll articles published in the Chinese Journal of Internal Medicine covered by Chinese Medical Citation Index(CMCI) from 2008 to 2010 were searched and downloaded. Some article related attributions were manual added and their influences to IF were analyzed.\nA total of 1164 academic papers were published in the journal in 3 years, with 9.95 references per paper. The total citation was 1029 times, with 0.93 time per paper and 0.31 time per page. Among them, 736 articles were not cited, accounting for 63.2%.

However, the striatum does not act in isolation and reversal learning is also well-accepted to depend on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the amygdala. Here we assessed whether dopaminergic drug effects on human striatal BOLD signaling during reversal learning is associated with anatomical connectivity in an orbitofrontal-limbic-striatal network, as measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). By using a fiber-based approach, we demonstrate that dopaminergic drug effects on striatal BOLD signal varied as a function of fractional anisotropy (FA) in a pathway connecting the OFC with the amygdala. Moreover, our experimental design allowed us to establish that these white-matter dependent drug effects were mediated via D2 receptors. Thus, white matter dependent effects of the D2 receptor agonist bromocriptine on striatal BOLD signal were abolished by co-administration with the D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride. These data provide fundamental insight into the mechanism of action of dopaminergic drug effects during reversal learning. In addition, they may have important clinical implications by suggesting that white matter integrity can help predict dopaminergic drug effects on brain function, ultimately contributing to individual tailoring of dopaminergic drug treatment strategies in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "An interprofessional psychiatric advanced pharmacy practice experience.", "Abstract": "To create an interprofessional psychiatry advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) and assess the initial outcomes.\nAn elective psychiatry APPE was developed in a setting of interdisciplinary practice.

The CAP has conducted three surveys since 1996. This paper reports on the 2012 survey.\nTo investigate the composition (i.e. age and gender) of specialists working in child and adolescent psychiatry, to find out how much time these psychiatrists really spend on child and adolescent psychiatry and what type of work they actually do; furthermore, to make a list of specific questions such as 24-hour availability, and to note opinions regarding the planned transfer of child and adolescent mental health care facilities to town councils.\nA survey was conducted and an analysis was made of the data collected.\nThe number of specialists practicing child and adolescent psychiatry in the Netherlands, expressed in full-time equivalents, has more than doubled since 1996 (from 183 in 1996 tot 389 in 2012). Compared to 1996, many more of these psychiatrists spend nearly all their time on CAP. The percentage of these specialists working only in private practice remains the same as in 1996 (19%) , although the percentage was lower in 2003 (135). Whereas in 1996 specialists in child and adolescent psychiatry worked mainly as psychotherapists, in 2012 they were working in a broader field, including assessment and pharmacotherapy.\nDutch CAP has grown substantially over the past 15 years. Growth in psychiatry in general has been even more marked. Considering the current composition of the population, there is only a relatively limited amount of specialised psychiatric help available for people under the age of 20. The impending transfer of CAP mental health care facilities to town councils is a matter of deep concern to professionals and to psychiatrists in particular. Only if CAP investigations continue over the coming years will it become clear that this deep concern is entirely justified."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry and brua].", "Abstract": "Patients from Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao are often inclined to attribute mental problems to brua, the Dutch-Antillean counterpart of voodoo.

For example, the mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a event-related potentials (ERPs), neurophysiological indices of sensory and cognitive function, are reduced in schizophrenia patients and may be used as biomarkers of the disease. In agreement with glutamatergic theories of schizophrenia, NMDA antagonists, such as ketamine, elicit many symptoms of schizophrenia when administered to normal subjects, including reductions in the MMN and the P3a. We sought to develop a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of schizophrenia based on NMDA-receptor blockade using subanesthetic administration of ketamine. This provided neurophysiological measures of sensory and cognitive function that were directly comparable to those recorded from humans. We first developed methods that allowed recording of ERPs from humans and rhesus macaques and found homologous MMN and P3a ERPs during an auditory oddball paradigm. We then investigated the effect of ketamine on these ERPs in macaques. As found in humans with schizophrenia, as well as in normal subjects given ketamine, we observed a significant decrease in amplitude of both ERPs. Our findings suggest the potential of a pharmacologically induced model of schizophrenia in NHPs that can pave the way for EEG-guided investigations into cellular mechanisms and therapies. Furthermore, given the established link between these ERPs, the glutamatergic system, and deficits in other neuropsychiatric disorders, our model can be used to investigate a wide range of pathologies."}, {"Title": "Use of a structured medication history to establish medication use at admission to an old age psychiatric clinic: a prospective observational study.", "Abstract": "Medication reconciliation results in fewer adverse drug events. The first step in medication reconciliation is to carry out a structured interview about medication use. It is not known whether such an interview is useful in inpatient old age psychiatry. The object of this study was to determine at admission the number of discrepancies in medication use, comparing the structured history of medication use (SHIM) procedure with the usual procedure for taking the medication history.\nA prospective observational study was conducted. All consecutive patients aged 55 years and older admitted from January until April 2011 to the inpatient old age psychiatric clinic of a large psychiatric teaching hospital in The Hague, the Netherlands, were eligible for inclusion; 50 patients were included. In every patient, the usual procedure (medication history-taking at admission by the treating physician) was compared with the SHIM procedure administered by the researcher. The SHIM procedure consists of a structured interview with the patient about the actual use of medication, incorporating the information from the community pharmacy and the patient's medications brought to the interview. The main outcome was the number of discrepancies in recorded medication use between the SHIM and the usual procedure.\nIn total, 100 discrepancies (median 2 per patient, range 0-8) in medication use were identified; 78 % (n = 39) of the patients had at least one discrepancy. Of the discrepancies, 69 % were drug omissions, and 31 % were drug additions or discrepancies in the frequency or dosage of medications. Eighty-two percent of all discrepancies were potentially clinically relevant. In 24 % of the patients, the discrepancies had clinical consequences.\nThe number of discrepancies that were found suggests that the usual procedure for taking the medication history can be improved. The SHIM procedure enables a comprehensive and accurate overview of the medication used by older patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital, and contributes to the prevention of clinically relevant adverse drug events."}, {"Title": "Active DNA demethylation in post-mitotic neurons: a reason for optimism.", "Abstract": "Over the last several years proteins involved in base excision repair (BER) have been implicated in active DNA demethylation. We review the literature supporting BER as a means of active DNA demethylation, and explain how the various components function and cooperate to remove the potentially most enduring means of epigenetic gene regulation. Recent evidence indicates that the same pathways implicated during periods of widespread DNA demethylation, such as the erasure of methyl marks in the paternal pronucleus soon after fertilization, are operational in post-mitotic neurons. Neuronal functional identities, defined here as the result of a combination of neuronal subtype, location, and synaptic connections are largely maintained through DNA methylation. Chronic mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, may be the result of both altered neurotransmitter levels and neurons that have assumed dysfunctional neuronal identities. A limitation of most current psychopharmacological agents is their focus on the former, while not addressing the more profound latter pathophysiological process. Previously, it was believed that active DNA demethylation in post-mitotic neurons was rare if not impossible. If this were the case, then reversing the factors that maintain neuronal identity, would be highly unlikely. The emergence of an active DNA demethylation pathway in the brain is a reason for great optimism in psychiatry as it provides a means by which previously pathological neurons may be reprogrammed to serve a more favorable role. Agents targeting epigenetic processes have shown much promise in this regard, and may lead to substantial gains over traditional pharmacological approaches."}, {"Title": "A Regression Framework for Effect Size Assessments in Longitudinal Modeling of Group Differences.", "Abstract": "The use of growth modeling analysis (GMA)--particularly multilevel analysis and latent growth modeling--to test the significance of intervention effects has increased exponentially in prevention science, clinical psychology, and psychiatry over the past 15 years.

Focus group discussions were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim, and we performed content analysis using NVivo 8 software.\nIn both care environments, participants emphasized the importance of communicating with service users, as well as assessing their needs and their particular situation, for reducing the use of restraint and seclusion. A better welcome and accompaniment of people admitted for short-term psychiatric care emerged also as key approaches to reduce the use of restraint and seclusion. Long-term care facilities could also reduce the need for restraint and seclusion by creating a stimulating home environment and individualized occupational therapy programs. Participants in both groups suggested that caregivers other than healthcare staff could be more involved, especially peer-support workers in the case of psychiatric care and volunteers in the case of long-term care facilities.\nParticipants suggested that changes were needed at a broader and more systemic level than simply replacing current measures of restraint and seclusion with alternative techniques.

We surveyed drug and alcohol screening routines in 34 general child and adolescent (only practice for adolescents, not children, was assessed) and 29 adult psychiatric outpatient departments in Stockholm County, Sweden. Structured telephone interviews mapping SUD screening procedures were conducted with department representatives in charge. Only a minority of child and adolescent departments regularly used SUD screening questionnaires (6\u00a0%) in ADHD and ASD assessment, while this was more common in adult psychiatry (55\u00a0%).

It influenced the genesis and design of his doctrine of understanding, General Psychopathology, even more decisively than Nietzsche's topos of resentment did. This article places Jaspers' work in the framework of a history of ideas. It begins by pursuing Nietzsche's perspective in the context of Darwinism, then focuses on the role concealed resentment played for Jaspers' genealogical concept of understanding in the first (1913) edition of General Psychopathology, which is primarily oriented towards Max Weber, before examining the idea of Kantian freedom, which was to become crucial for Jaspers' later work. The antinomy of freedom already shapes the suicidology contained in Jaspers' Philosophy of 1931. The idea gains prominence in the final, philosophically grounded revision of GeneralPsychopathology published in 1941/1942. Jaspers' reception of Kantian idealism leads him to develop a concept of critical understanding that clearly distinguishes itself from speculative understanding, whose hazards Jaspers illustrates on the basis of Viktor von Weizs\u00e4cker's theory of medicine. This goes far beyond Kant, embracing Schelling and Hegel philosophically.

This paper argues that the micro-level perspective can be used to identify the smallest building blocks underlying the onset and course of mental ill-health. Psychopathology may be the result of the continuous dynamic interplay between micro-level moment-to-moment experiences and behavioural patterns over time. Reinforcing loops between momentary states may alter the course of mental health towards either a more or less healthy state. An example with observed data, from a population of individuals with depressive symptoms, supports the validity of a dynamic network model of psychopathology and shows that together and over time, this continuous interplay between momentary states may result in the cluster of symptoms we call major depressive disorder. This approach may help conceptualize the nature of mental disorders, and generate individualized insights useful for diagnosis and treatment in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Turkish intern nurses regarding physical restraints.", "Abstract": "This study was carried out to determine knowledge, attitudes, and practices of intern nurses who completed the nursing internship program on the use of physical restraints.\nThis research was conducted using descriptive and cross-sectional research design.\nThe study sample comprises 91 fourth-grade students who took an integrated curriculum and completed the nursing internship program.

The mean knowledge, attitude, and practice scores of the nurses for physical restraint were 9.38 \u00b1 1.19 (0-11 points), 34.70 \u00b1 5.62 (12-48 points), and 37.95 \u00b1 2.32 (14-42 points), respectively.\nIntern nurses' knowledge about how to use physical restraints was at a very good level; they displayed positive attitudes, and they used their knowledge and attitudes in their practices to a great extent.\nAlthough there are studies on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of nurses working in the fields of elderly care, rehabilitation, and psychiatry in acute care units, there are no studies investigating intern nurses and other nursing students. However, intern nurses about to begin their careers should make accurate decisions regarding the use of physical restrains if they are to ensure patient safety and to fulfill this application effectively in their professional lives."}, {"Title": "Reliability and validity of the German version of the Structured Interview of Personality Organization (STIPO).", "Abstract": "The assessment of personality organization and its observable behavioral manifestations, i.e. personality functioning, has a long tradition in psychodynamic psychiatry. Recently, the DSM-5 Levels of Personality Functioning Scale has moved it into the focus of psychiatric diagnostics. Based on Kernberg's concept of personality organization the Structured Interview of Personality Organization (STIPO) was developed for diagnosing personality functioning. The STIPO covers seven dimensions: (1) identity, (2) object relations, (3) primitive defenses, (4) coping/rigidity, (5) aggression, (6) moral values, and (7) reality testing and perceptual distortions. The English version of the STIPO has previously revealed satisfying psychometric properties.\nValidity and reliability of the German version of the 100-item instrument have been evaluated in 122 psychiatric patients. All patients were diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and were assessed by means of the STIPO. Moreover, all patients completed eight questionnaires that served as criteria for external validity of the STIPO.\nInterrater reliability varied between intraclass correlations of .89 and 1.0, Crohnbach's \u03b1 for the seven dimensions was .69 to .93. All a priori selected questionnaire scales correlated significantly with the corresponding STIPO dimensions. Patients with personality disorder (PD) revealed significantly higher STIPO scores (i.e. worse personality functioning) than patients without PD; patients cluster B PD showed significantly higher STIPO scores than patients with cluster C PD.\nInterrater reliability, Crohnbach's \u03b1, concurrent validity, and differential validity of the STIPO are satisfying. The STIPO represents an appropriate instrument for the assessment of personality functioning in clinical and research settings."}, {"Title": "A review of systems for psychology and psychiatry: adaptive systems, personality psychopathology five (PSY-5), and the DSM-5.", "Abstract": "We outline a crisis in clinical description, in which atheoretical categorical descriptors, as in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), has turned focus away from the obvious: evolved major adaptive systems. Adaptive systems, at the core of a medical review of systems (ROS), allow models of pathology to be layered over an understanding of systems as they normally function. We argue that clinical psychology and psychiatry would develop more programmatically by incorporating 5 systems evolved for adaptation to the external environment: reality modeling for action, short-term danger detection, long-term cost-benefit projection, resource acquisition, and agenda protection. These systems, although not exhaustive, coincide with great historical issues in psychology, psychopathology, and individual differences. Readers of this journal should be interested in this approach because personality is seen as a relatively stable property of these systems. Thus, an essential starting point in ROS-based clinical description involves personality assessment. But this approach also places demands on scientist-practitioners to integrate across sciences. An ROS promotes theories that are (a) compositional, answering the question: What elements comprise the system?; (b) dynamic, answering: How do the elements and other systems interact?; and (c) developmental: How do systems change over time? The proposed ROS corresponds well with the National Institute of Mental Health's recent research domain criteria (RDoC) approach. We urge that in the RDoC approach, measurement variables should be treated as falsifiable and theory-laden markers, not unfalsifiable criteria. We argue that our proposed ROS promotes integration across sciences, rather than fostering the isolation of sciences allowed by atheoretical observation terms, as in the DSM."}, {"Title": "Influence of patient characteristics on duration of seclusion/restrain in acute psychiatric settings in Japan.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the current state of duration of seclusion/restraint in acute psychiatric settings in Japan and the effect of patient characteristics on duration of seclusion/restraint.\nDuring an 8-month period starting from November 2008, duration of seclusion/restraint and patient characteristics were investigated in 694 psychiatric inpatients who experienced seclusion/restraint in three emergency and three acute wards at four psychiatric hospitals. Reasons for starting seclusion/restraint were also assessed. Analysis was performed using generalized linear models, with the duration of seclusion/restraint as the dependent variable and patient characteristics and reasons for starting seclusion/restraint as independent variables.\nOf the patients secluded/restrained, 58.6% had a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia (F20-F29) and a large proportion (37.9%) were secluded/restrained due to hurting others. Median hours ofseclusion/restraint were 204 and 82\u2009h, respectively. The duration of seclusion was longer for patients with F20-F29 than those with disorders due to psychoactive substance use (F10-F19) or other diagnoses (F40-F99), and when the reason was danger of hurting others. In contrast, the duration of restraint in female patients and in patients with F10-F19 diagnosis was shorter.\nThe duration of seclusion/restraint at acute psychiatric care wards in Japan are much longer than those reported by previous overseas studies. Although Japanese structure issues such as more patients per ward and a lower ratio of nurses need to be considered, skills for dealing with patients with primary diagnosis of F20-F29 secluded due to danger posed to others should be improved."}, {"Title": "A \"glucose eater\" drug as a therapeutic agent in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Metformin, currently approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, is an interesting drug that has various cellular and molecular mechanisms.

Such knowledge could provide a basis for the design of interventions to change prescribing patterns for psychotropics. The aim of this study was to explore the views of general practitioners (GPs), GP interns, and heads of primary care units on factors affecting the prescribing of psychotropic drugs in primary care.\nWe performed four focus group discussions in Gothenburg, Sweden, with a total of 21 participants (GPs, GP interns, and heads of primary care units). The focus group discussions were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using manifest content analysis.\nThree different themes emerged from the focus group discussions. The first theme Seeking care for symptoms, reflects the participants' understanding of why patients approach primary care and comprised categories such as knowledge, attitudes, and society and the media. The second theme, Lacking a framework, resources, and treatment alternatives, which reflects the conditions for the physician-patient interaction, comprised categories such as economy and resources, technology, and organizational aspects. The third theme, Restricting or maintaining prescriptions, with the subthemes Individual factors and External influences, reflects the physicians' internal decision making and comprised categories such as emotions, knowledge, and pharmaceutical industry.\nThe results of the present study indicate that a variety of factors may affect the prescribing of psychotropic medications in primary care. Many factors were related to characteristics of the patient, the physician or their interaction, rather than the patients' medical needs per se. The results may be useful for interventions to improve psychotropic prescribing in primary care."}, {"Title": "Voices across the fence: commonality, difference and respectful practice across a half century of change.", "Abstract": "To describe changes that have occurred in the field of indigenous mental health over the last 50 years.\nThe last half-century has seen major advances in psychiatry and in the roles and capacities of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.

Gewirtz et al. (Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry 22:625-648, 1998) found that, in rats, persistent shock-induced startle increases were prevented by pre-test electrolytic lesions of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). We used reversible inactivation to determine if similar effects reflect actions on (a) BNST neurons themselves versus fibers-of-passage, (b) the development versus expression of such increases, and (c) associative fear versus non-associative sensitization. Twenty-four hours after the last of three shock sessions, startle was markedly enhanced when rats were tested in a non-shock context. These increases decayed over the course of several days. Decay was unaffected by context exposure, and elevated startle was restored when rats were tested for the first time in the original shock context. Thus, both associative and non-associative components could be measured under different conditions. Pre-test intra-BNST infusions of the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX (3\u00a0\u03bcg/side) blocked the non-associative (as did infusions into the basolateral amygdala) but not the associative component, whereas pre-shock infusions disrupted both. NBQX did not affect baseline startle or shock reactivity. These results indicate that AMPA receptors in or very near to the BNST are critical for the expression and development of non-associative shock-induced startle sensitization, and also for context fear conditioning, but not context fear expression. More generally, they suggest that treatments targeting the BNST may be clinically useful for treating trauma-related hyper-arousal and perhaps for retarding its development."}, {"Title": "Taiwan consensus of pharmacological treatment for bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "Bipolar disorder is an important psychiatric disorder with different disease phases.

Participant observation research conducted between 2008 and 2012 for a larger study involving 127 interviews with policy makers, clinic managers, clinical practitioners and patients revealed that the shift heralded the decline of arts based therapies in the clinic, and of the social networks that had developed around them. It also inspired a participatory video self-documentary project among art group members, to portray the importance of arts-based therapies and garner public support for such therapies. Group members found a way to take action in the face of unilateral decision making, but experienced subsequent restrictions on clinic activities and discharge of core members from the clinic.

This paper sets out to detect the feasibility of reform in a psychiatric clinic in a Swedish hospital prior to implementation of a new working method - a structured tool based on the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health. A survey consisting of two instruments - an organizational values questionnaire (OVQ) and a resistance to change scale (RTC) - was distributed to registered and assistant nurses at the clinic. The association between the organizational subcultures and resistance to change was investigated with regression analysis. The results revealed that the dominating cultures in the outpatient centers and hospital wards were characterized by human relation properties such as flexibility, cohesion, belongingness, and trust. The mean resistance to change was low, but the subscale of cognitive rigidity was dominant, reflecting a tendency to avoid alternative ideas and perspectives.

Somatoform disorder diagnoses were solely based on file-content.\nDepression in migrants presented as a complex, chronic clinical picture. Most of our migrant patients experienced significant psychosocial adversity before and after migration: beyond cultural issues, our results suggest that psychosocial adversity impacts on the clinical expression of depression. Our study also suggests that migration associated with psychosocial adversity might play a specific etiological role, resulting in a distinct clinical picture, questioning the DSM-IV unitarian model of depression. The chronic course might indicate a resistance to standard therapeutic regimen and hints at the necessity of developing specific treatment strategies, adapted to the individual patients and their specific context."}, {"Title": "Effect of COMT Val158Met polymorphism on personality traits and educational attainment in a longitudinal population representative study.", "Abstract": "The COMT Val158Met polymorphism has been associated with anxiety and affective disorders, but its effect on anxiety-related personality traits varies between studies. Our purpose was to investigate the effect of COMT Val158Met on personality traits from adolescence to young adulthood in a population representative Caucasian birth cohort. Also its association with educational attainment and anxiety and mood disorders by the age 25 were examined. This analysis is based on the older cohort of the Estonian Children Personality Behavior and Health Study (original number of subjects 593). The personality traits were assessed when the participants were 15, 18 and 25 years old. COMT Val158Met had an effect on Neuroticism in females by age 25 (p=0.001, Bonferroni-corrected for five traits), whereas female Val homozygotes scored the highest. In addition, the Conscientiousness scores of subjects with Val/Val genotype were decreasing in time, being the lowest by the age 25 (p=0.006, Bonferroni-corrected for five traits). By the age 25, males with the Val/Met genotype had mainly secondary or vocational education, whereas female heterozygotes mostly had obtained or were obtaining university education. COMT Val158Met was not associated with anxiety or mood disorders in either gender. These results suggest that genes affecting dopamine system are involved in the development of personality traits and contribute to educational attainment."}, {"Title": "[Antipsychotic-drug-induced hyperprolactinemia: physiopathology, clinical features and guidance].", "Abstract": "Hyperprolactinemia is a frequent but neglected adverse effect observed in patients treated with antipsychotic-drugs. In this review, we summarize its physiopathogenetic mechanism, its clinical manifestations in men and women, and the way to manage it.\nProlactin is a hormone secreted by lactotroph cells in the anterior pituitary. Its synthesis and release are under the control of peptides, steroids and neurotransmitters. The main inhibitory regulation is made by dopamine, which binds dopamine receptors D2 on the membrane of lactotroph cells. Antipsychotic-drugs block these receptors and thus remove the inhibitory effect of dopamine on prolactin secretion. All antipsychotic-drugs block D2 receptors and all can induce hyperprolactinemia. Nonetheless, it seems that the faster the antipsychotic-drug dissociates from D2 receptors, the lesser the increase of prolactin in the plasma. Another way to explain hyperprolactinemia is the ability of antipsychotic-drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier. The role of their metabolites should also be considered. For these reasons, one can distinguish prolactin-raising (conventional neuroleptics, amisulpride, risperidone) and prolactin-sparing (clozapine, aripiprazole, olanzapine) antipsychotics. An English study showed that 18% of men and 47% of women treated with antipsychotics for severe mental illness had a prolactin level above the normal range. Hyperprolactinemia is in fact more frequent in women than in men. Sometimes it is asymptomatic, but the higher the prolactin level is, the more patients have clinical manifestations. Some symptoms are due to the hypogonadism caused by prolactin, which disturbs hypothalamic-pituitary axis function, and others are due to direct effects on target tissues. Consequently, patients can suffer from sexual dysfunction, infertility, amenorrhea, gynecomastia or galactorrhoea. Data suggest that these symptoms are common, but patients don't mention them spontaneously and clinicians underestimate their prevalence. In the long-term, hypogonadism involves a premature bone loss in men and women. Klibanski and colleagues showed that this loss is significant only in women with hyperprolactinemia associated with amenorrhea. That suggests that prolactin is not directly responsible for this clinical feature. Nevertheless, prolactin seems to be involved in the development of breast cancer, but its role is unclear for prostate cancer.\nOur review promotes a check-up before beginning a treatment with antipsychotic agents. First, a baseline prolactin level should be measured. It should also include the research on previous treatment with antipsychotic-drugs and the assessment of adverse effects suggestive of hyperprolactinemia. Questioning should finally look for any contra-indication to antipsychotics. Monitoring during antipsychotic treatment has been studied by a group of international experts in psychiatry, medicine, toxicology and pharmacy who made a critical review of clinical guidance on hyperprolactinemia. Experts notify that it is important to check whether patients have any sexual dysfunction, such as loss of libido or menstrual irregularity, and galactorrhoea. Prolactin level should also be controlled after three months of stable dose treatment, or if any clinical feature of hyperprolactinemia appears. If a patient prescribed antipsychotic-drugs has a confirmed prolactin level above the normal range, it is necessary to exclude other causes of hyperprolactinemia. If antipsychotics are really involved, the management should be adapted with the prolactin level and the patient him/herself. To summarize, clinicians can decrease the dose of the antipsychotic or switch to a prolactin-sparing drug. Oral contraceptives can be added whether to prevent pregnancy or to prevent bone loss and osteoporosis. Finally, experts recommend reserving dopamine agonists to treat antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia in very exceptional circumstances as it can worsen the mental illness."}, {"Title": "Theory of mind and the social brain: implications for understanding the genetic basis of schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies in schizophrenia have recently made significant progress in our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of this disorder. Many genetic loci have been identified and now require functional investigation. One approach involves studying their correlation with neuroimaging and neurocognitive endophenotypes. Theory of Mind (ToM) deficits are well established in schizophrenia and they appear to fulfill criteria for being considered an endophenotype. We aim to review the behavioral and neuroimaging-based studies of ToM in schizophrenia, assess its suitability as an endophenotype, discuss current findings, and propose future research directions. Suitable research articles were sourced from a comprehensive literature search and from references identified through other studies. ToM deficits are repeatable, stable, and heritable: First-episode patients, those in remission and unaffected relatives all show deficits. Activation and structural differences in brain regions believed important for ToM are also consistently reported in schizophrenia patients at all stages of illness, although no research to date has examined unaffected relatives. Studies using ToM as an endophenotype are providing interesting genetic associations with both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and specific copy number variations (CNVs) such as the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. We conclude that ToM is an important cognitive endophenotype for consideration in future studies addressing the complex genetic architecture of schizophrenia, and may help identify more homogeneous clinical sub-types for further study."}, {"Title": "Influence of CRTC1 polymorphisms on body mass index and fat mass in psychiatric patients and the general adult population.", "Abstract": "There is a high prevalence of obesity in psychiatric patients, possibly leading to metabolic complications and reducing life expectancy.

To this fill this gap, we interviewed investigators who conduct functional neuroimaging studies involving adults with mood disorders, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, providers who offer clinical neuroimaging services in the open marketplace, and consumers of these services, in order to understand perspectives underlying different views and practices.\nSemi-structured interviews were conducted over the telephone. Verbal consent was obtained and all interviews were audio recorded. Interviews of investigators and service providers followed the same interview guide. A separate set of questions was developed for consumers. All interviews were transcribed and made software ready. We applied the qualitative methodology of constant comparison to analyze the data, whereby two researchers independently analyzed the results into textual themes. Coding discrepancies were discussed until consensus was achieved.\nInvestigators, service providers, and consumers held many common perspectives about the potential or actual risks and benefits of functional neuroimaging for mental illness. However, we also found striking divergences. Service providers focused on the challenges posed by the persistence of symptoms based diagnostic categories, whereas the limitations of the science in this area was the challenge noted most frequently by investigators. The majority of consumers stated that their expectations were met.\nOur findings point toward a fundamental tension between academic investigators on the one hand, and commercial service providers and their customers on the other. This scenario poses dangers to the communities directly involved, and to public trust in science and medicine more generally.

In this context, access to medical care should be provided by the establishment of guidelines and/or recommendations for this specific population. The aim of our study was to assess how cancer was managed among long term psychiatric inpatients. For this pilot study, we used a mixed methodology: a quantitative part with a retrospective chart review of cancer patients in a psychiatric institution and a qualitative part based on semi-structured interviews with psychiatrists with discourse analysis. Delay in cancer diagnosis can be explained by communication and behavior disorders, inadequate screening, and additional tests often refused by patients. Compliance and ethical issues (i.e. obtaining informed consent) are many pitfalls to optimal cancer care that should be explored in further research."}, {"Title": "[Social decision-making and theoretical neuroscience: prospects for human sciences and computational psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Learning to predict others' minds is critical for social cognition, but the underlying computation and neural mechanisms remains largely unknown. According to theories in social cognition, a simple conception is that humans simulate others' mental processes by directly recruiting one's own process to model others' minds. In this review, we first describe our recent finding and discuss its possible implications. Using human fMRI with model-based analysis on frameworks of reinforcement learning and value-based decision making, we found that simulation involves two hierarchical learning signals: a reward prediction error, generated by simulation of direct recruitment to model others' valuation, and an action prediction error, based on simulation and observation of the other's choices to track others' variability. These findings show that humans can learn to predict others' minds from simulation, using a scaffold of mentalizing signals. Then, we discuss prospects that theoretical neuroscience and computational approaches will play significant roles in understanding human behavior and neural mechanisms, leading to the so-called computational psychiatry as well as synthesis over different disciplines to study human."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric consultation-liaison interventions: recollection, perception and outcome.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate recollection, perception and outcome of psychiatric consultation in a general hospital.\n321 patients with three main diagnoses (substance use, affective, and adjustment disorders), who had been examined by consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatrists within the past twelve months, initially took part in a telephone interview and were subsequently asked to complete and return questionnaires by mail.\nResponse rates for the telephone interview were 75.4%, and 46.7% of patients returned the completed questionnaires. 86.0% of the patients were able to remember seeing the C-L psychiatrist and 43.3% recalled their diagnosis accurately. 70.5% stated that this contact had been helpful. 61.5% remembered being given a psychiatric after-care recommendation, and 43.5% of the patients stated that they either disregarded or prematurely discontinued after-care.\nEven though the perception of the consultation is generally positive, many patients are not able to retain the given information on diagnosis and treatment recommendation.

The Bipolar Trials Network developed and implemented the MRTF in a comparative effectiveness study for bipolar disorder (LiTMUS). The MRTF was used to assess the frequency, types, and reasons for medication adjustments. Changes in treatment were operationalized by the metric Necessary Clinical Adjustments (NCA), defined as medication adjustments to reduce symptoms, optimize treatment response and functioning, or to address intolerable side effects. Randomized treatment groups did not differ in rates of NCAs, however, responders had significantly fewer NCAs than non-responders. Patients who had more NCAs during their previous visit had significantly lower odds of responding at the current visit. For each one-unit increase in previous CGI-BP depression score and CGI-BP overall severity score, patients had an increased NCA rate of 13% and 15%, respectively at the present visit. Ten-unit increases in previous Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores resulted in an 18% and 14% increase in rates of NCAs, respectively. Patients with fewer NCAs had increased quality of life and decreased functional impairment. The MRTF standardizes the reporting and rationale for medication adjustments and provides an innovative metric for clinical effectiveness. As the first tool in psychiatry to track the types and reasons for medication changes, it has important implications for training new clinicians and examining clinical decision making.

However, these studies have been limited in that they have not been able to directly assess differential patterns of gene expression in the human brain. Here, we assessed G \u00d7 E interactions using two publically available datasets to assess if DNA variation is associated with post-mortem brain gene expression changes based on smoking behavior, a biobehavioral construct that is part of a complex system of genetic and environmental influences.\nWe conducted an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study on two independent human brain gene expression datasets assessing G \u00d7 E for selected psychiatric genes and smoking status. We employed linear regression to model the significance of the Gene \u00d7 Smoking interaction term, followed by meta-analysis across datasets.\nOverall, we observed that the effect of DNA variation on gene expression is moderated by smoking status. Expression of 16 genes was significantly associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms that demonstrated G \u00d7 E effects. The strongest finding (p = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9) was neurexin 3-alpha (NRXN3), a synaptic cell-cell adhesion molecule involved in maintenance of neural connections (such as the maintenance of smoking behavior). Other significant G \u00d7 E associations include four glutamate genes.\nThis is one of the first studies to demonstrate G \u00d7 E effects within the human brain. In particular, this study implicated NRXN3 in the maintenance of smoking. The effect of smoking on NRXN3 expression and downstream behavior is different based upon SNP genotype, indicating that DNA profiles based on SNPs could be useful in understanding the effects of smoking behaviors. These results suggest that better measurement of psychiatric conditions, and the environment in post-mortem brain studies may yield an important avenue for understanding the biological mechanisms of G \u00d7 E interactions in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Photooxidation mechanism of levomepromazine in different solvents.", "Abstract": "Unwanted photoinduced responses are well-known adverse effects of most promazine drugs, including levomepromazine (LPZ, Levoprome(\u00ae) or Nozinan(\u00ae)). This drug is indicated in psychiatry primarily for the treatment of schizophrenia and other schizoaffective disorders. Levomepromazine's particular sedative properties make it especially fit for use in psychiatric intensive care. Nevertheless, it is photolabile under UV-A and UV-B light in aerobic conditions resulting in the formation of its sulfoxide. The LPZ photochemistry in acetonitrile (MeCN) is completely different from that in methanol (MeOH) and phosphate buffer solutions (PBS, pH = 7.4). The major photoproduct in PBS and MeOH under aerobic conditions is levomepromazine sulfoxide (LPZSO), although the amount is considerably higher in the aqueous environment. The corresponding main photoproduct in MeCN could not be characterized. The destruction quantum yields of LPZ in PBS, MeOH and MeCN are 0.13, 0.02 and <10(-3), respectively. It is further demonstrated that LPZSO does not form by the reaction of singlet oxygen with ground-state LPZ. This oxidation product is actually produced by the reaction of the cation radical of LPZ (LPZ\u00b7(+)) with molecular oxygen. This cation radical in turn, is produced by an electron transfer process between the (3) LPZ* and ground-state molecular oxygen."}, {"Title": "The borderline mother and her child: a couple at risk.", "Abstract": "The child whose mother is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) is at risk for developing this disorder.

The first case is of a patient with BPD who, after surrendering custody of her two children to their father, participated in weekly Dynamic Deconstructive Psychotherapy sessions for two years. The second case is a mother with BPD who presents for dyadic therapy with her three-month-old daughter.

We now want to draw attention to conditions that mainly apply to patients with mental disorders.\nBy searching the DPIA database over the past 15 years, we identified 1,278 patients with mental disorders. These patients were studied with respect to whether they had been treated within the psychiatric specialty or in a somatic specialty. During the study period, there was a change of opinion in the legal system after the Supreme Court ruled that surveillance of a psychiatric patient during admission, e.g. as anti-suicide precaution, should also be considered part of the treatment.\nOf the registered claims, 742 had received specialised psychiatric treatment for their mental disorders, and 536 had been treated in one of the somatic specialties. Of the 1,278 patients, 16% had their claims accepted. A marked difference was found in the acceptance rate of claims between these two groups: in psychiatry, 13% of the claims were accepted, whereas in the somatic specialties, the acceptance rate was 21%. Both of these numbers are well below the usual DPIA acceptance rate, which is 36% (p = 0.001). During the study period, there was a change in the Danish legal system after the Danish Supreme Court ruled that surveillance of a psychiatric patient during admission, e.g. as an anti-suicide precaution, should be considered part of the treatment.\nThe low acceptance rate for claims made by patients with mental disorders concerning treatment or examination may, in part, be due to the lodging of unqualified claims, but other causes may also have contributed to this.

Paradoxically however, and while difficulties to perform this integrative process have been suggested in a large range of psychopathological states (e.g., schizophrenia and autism), these crossmodal paradigms have been very rarely used in the exploration of psychiatric populations. The main aim of the present paper is thus to underline the experimental and clinical usefulness of exploring crossmodal processes in psychiatry. We will illustrate this proposal by means of the recent data obtained in the crossmodal exploration of emotional alterations in alcohol-dependence. Indeed, emotional decoding impairments might have a role in the development and maintenance of alcohol-dependence, and have been extensively investigated by means of experiments using separated visual or auditory stimulations. Besides these unimodal explorations, we have recently conducted several studies using audio-visual crossmodal paradigms, which has allowed us to improve the ecological validity of the unimodal experimental designs and to offer new insights on the emotional alterations among alcohol-dependent individuals.

Here, we present and evaluate automated methods of frontal lobe parcellation with the programs FreeSurfer(FS) and TOADS-CRUISE(T-C), based on the manual method described in Ranta et al. [2009]: Psychiatry Res 172:147-154 in which sulcal-gyral landmarks were used to manually delimit functionally relevant regions within the frontal lobe: i.e., primary motor cortex, anterior cingulate, deep white matter, premotor cortex regions (supplementary motor complex, frontal eye field, and lateral premotor cortex) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions (medial PFC, dorsolateral PFC, inferior PFC, lateral orbitofrontal cortex [OFC] and medial OFC). Dice's coefficient, a measure of overlap, and percent volume difference were used to measure the reliability between manual and automated delineations for each frontal lobe region. For FS, mean Dice's coefficient for all regions was 0.75 and percent volume difference was 21.2%. For T-C the mean Dice's coefficient was 0.77 and the mean percent volume difference for all regions was 20.2%. These results, along with a high degree of agreement between the two automated methods (mean Dice's coefficient = 0.81, percent volume difference = 12.4%) and a proof-of-principle group difference analysis that highlights the consistency and sensitivity of the automated methods, indicate that the automated methods are valid techniques for parcellation of the frontal lobe into functionally relevant sub-regions. Thus, the methodology has the potential to increase efficiency, statistical power and reproducibility for population analyses of neuropsychiatric disorders with hypothesized frontal lobe contributions."}, {"Title": "Neuropsychological functioning in posttraumatic stress disorder following forced displacement in older adults and their offspring.", "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate neuropsychological performance in an untried trauma sample of older adults displaced during childhood at the end of World War II (WWII) with and without posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as transgenerational effects of trauma and PTSD on their offspring. Displaced older adults with (n=20) and without PTSD (n=24) and nondisplaced healthy individuals (n=11) as well as one of their respective offspring were assessed with a large battery of cognitive tests (primarily targeting memory functioning). No evidence for deficits in neuropsychological performance was found in the aging group of displaced people with PTSD. Moreover, no group difference emerged in the offspring groups. Findings may be interpreted as first evidence for a rather resilient PTSD group of older adults that is available for assessment 60 years after displacement."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric comorbidities in dystonia: emerging concepts.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric disorders are highly prevalent in patients with dystonia and have a profound effect on quality of life. Patients with dystonia frequently meet criteria for anxiety disorders, especially social phobia, and major depressive disorder. Deficits in emotional processing have also been demonstrated in some dystonia populations. Onset of psychiatric disturbances in patients with dystonia often precedes onset of motor symptoms, suggesting that the pathophysiology of dystonia itself contributes to the genesis of psychiatric disturbances. This article examines the hypothesis that mood and anxiety disorders are intrinsic to the neurobiology of dystonia, citing the available literature, which is derived mostly from research on focal isolated dystonias. Limitations of studies are identified, and the role of emotional reactivity, especially in the context of pain secondary to dystonia, is recognized. Available evidence underscores the need to develop dystonia assessment tools that incorporate psychiatric measures. Such tools would allow for a better understanding of the full spectrum of dystonia presentations and facilitate research on the treatment of dystonia as well as the treatment of psychiatric illnesses in the context of dystonia. This article, solicited for a special Movement Disorders issue on novel research findings and emerging concepts in dystonia, addresses the following issues: (1) To what extent are psychiatric disturbances related to the pathophysiology of dystonia? (2) What is the impact of psychiatric disturbances on outcome measures of current assessment tools for dystonia? (3) How do psychiatric comorbidities influence the treatment of dystonia? Answers to these questions will lead to an increased appreciation of psychiatric disorders in dystonia, a better understanding of brain physiology, more nuanced research questions pertaining to this population, better clinical scales that can be used to further patient management and research, and improved patient outcomes. \u00a9 2013 Movement Disorder Society."}, {"Title": "[Gottfried Ewald and the \"operation t4\" in G\u00f6ttingen].", "Abstract": "Gottfried Ewald (1888-1963) had been director of the State Hospital and Nursing Home and the University Clinic for Psychiatry from 1934.

In the DD group there was an attempt to evaluate the relation between substance use disorders and co-occuring mental disorders performed.\nThe frequency of DD among all patients hospitalized in the studied period of time was 8.3%, whereas among patients abusing SP was 30.5%. This study demonstrates that patients with the DD are statistically longer hospitalized, discharged from hospitals at their own request and more often need treatment in hospitals, statistically more often try to commit suicide and perform aggressive behavior. Mental disorders were substantially often secondary to substance related disorders in the DD group. There was proved that patients mainly abused alcohol and the most frequent mental disorder were mood (affective) disorders."}, {"Title": "Simulation-based ongoing professional practice evaluation in psychiatry: a novel tool for performance assessment.", "Abstract": "Ongoing professional practice evaluation (OPPE) activities consist of a quantitative, competency-based evaluation of clinical performance.

The growing clinical and preclinical interest in psychedelic, dissociative, and deliriant hallucinogens necessitates novel translational, sensitive, and high-throughput in vivo models and screens. Primate and rodent models have been traditionally used to study cellular mechanisms and neural circuits of hallucinogenic drugs' action. The utility of zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) in neuroscience research is rapidly growing due to their high physiological and genetic homology to humans, ease of genetic manipulation, robust behaviors, and cost effectiveness. Possessing a fully characterized genome, both adult and larval zebrafish are currently widely used for in vivo screening of various psychotropic compounds, including hallucinogens and related drugs. Recognizing the growing importance of hallucinogens in biological psychiatry, here we discuss hallucinogenic-induced phenotypes in zebrafish and evaluate their potential as efficient preclinical models of drug-induced states in humans."}, {"Title": "On the autonomy of the concept of disease in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Does the reference to a mental realm in using the notion of mental disorder lead to a dilemma that consists in either implying a Cartesian account of the mind-body relation or in the need to give up a notion of mental disorder in its own right?

However, this conviction is based on a limited awareness of the philosophical debate on the mind-body problem.

This review highlights findings regarding the prevalence and consequence of nonadherence, barriers to adherence and new intervention methods from 2012 onwards.\nRecent research has highlighted that nonadherence is a global challenge for psychiatry and has linked nonadherence to poorer outcomes, including hospital admissions, suicide and mortality. Optimizing medication regimens can reduce nonadherence; however, often a complex interplay of factors affects individuals' motivation and ability to follow their prescription. Psychiatrists can enable patients to develop an accurate model of their illness and treatment and facilitate adherence. However, nonadherence is often a hidden issue within consultations.

Recent problems of psychiatry originate from special development, controversial process of detachment, particular societal and cultural roots, differences from medical model, and problems of identity, self-determination and competence, which may cause many difficulties in clinical practice. The author - near the review of the theoretical background - mentions several practical topics as well, for example: the difficulties of diagnosing, and classification of mental disorders, the diagnostic and treating problems being in the background of psychopathological symptoms. In the article it is emphasized that the present situation results in several serious problems for the psychiatrists like emotional overburden, somatic and mental disorders and burnout, moreover psychiatry became one of the least popular medical professions, which causes huge difficulties in the aftergrowth. Furthermore the author emphasises, that this profession has to actualize the humanistic view in clinical practice based on the holistic bio-psycho-socio-spiritual approach.

Antidepressant use in the elderly without dementia has previously been shown to be associated with high risks of adverse events and with structural brain alterations.\nTo investigate cortical changes associated with depression and antidepressant use in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD).\n74 subjects with mild AD and LBD from geriatric and psychiatry outpatient clinics in Western Norway were included. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to assess depression. Automatic preprocessing using Freesurfer included steps for white and grey matter surface reconstruction.

Treatment-associated thinning was observed in the parahippocampal region and was significant even after correction for age, sex, AD/LBD diagnosis, and MADRS scores.\nDepression in mild AD and LBD is associated with cortical thinning in prefrontal and temporal areas. The findings suggest that depressive symptoms in mild dementia could develop due to neurodegeneration in the same neural circuits that are critical for depression across different brain disorders. Antidepressant use in patients with mild AD and LBD is associated with parahippocampal thinning.

Nurses often experience work-related stress. High stress can negatively affect job satisfaction and lead to emotional exhaustion with risk of burnout. Aim. To analyse possible differences in biological stress markers, psychosocial working conditions, health, and well-being between nurses working in two different departments. Methods. Stress was evaluated in nurses working in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (n = 33) and nurses working in a child and adolescent psychiatry inpatient ward (CAP) (n = 14) using salivary cortisol and HbA1c. Salivary cortisol was measured three times a day on two consecutive days during two one-week periods, seven weeks apart (=\u200912 samples/person). Psychosocial working conditions, health, and well-being were measured once. Results. NICU nurses had better social support and more self-determination. CAP nurses had a lower salivary cortisol quotient, poorer general health, and higher client-related burnout scores. Conclusion. When comparing these nurses with existing norm data for Sweden, as a group their scores reflect less work-related stress than Swedes overall. However, the comparison between NICU and CAP nurses indicates a less healthy work situation for CAP nurses. Relevance to Clinical Practice.

The social emphasis in individualism and responsibility may have changed not only the frequency, but also the phenomenology of mood disorders particularly the increases in bipolar disorders. From the sociobiological standpoint the conditions that may favour \"subthreshold\" bipolar or depressive features are to be considered in relation to the contextual role of gender and the different risks of the two disorders in males and females."}, {"Title": "How Mental Illness is Perceived by Iranian Medical Students: A Preliminary Study.", "Abstract": "The study aimed to assess medical students' attitudes toward mental illness following a 4-week psychiatry clerkship. All fifth-year medical students from three academic centers in Tehran were asked to participate in the study. They completed the questionnaire on the last day of their 4-week psychiatry clerkship. A self-administered questionnaire was used to examine participants' Attitudes Toward Mental Illness (ATMI). One hundred and sixty eight students completed the questionnaires (88.9% response rate). In general, the students had favorable attitudes toward mental illness at the end of their clerkship, with mean (\u00b1 SD) ATMI total score of 78.6 (\u00b1 8.1) (neutral score, 66.0). The students showed the most favorable opinion (95.2%) about Category 5 (stereotypic attitude toward people with mental illness) whilst they revealed the least favorable opinion (64.3%) regarding Category 1 (social relations with people affected by mental illness). In addition, the students thought that movies were on the top of influential media on shaping the attitudes toward mental illness. Overall, most of Iranian medical students had generally favorable attitudes toward people with mental illness at the end of their clerkship. Therefore, it may be expected next generation of medical doctors show more favorable attitude toward mental illness."}, {"Title": "Association between childhood adversities and adulthood depressive symptoms in South Korea: results from a nationally representative longitudinal study.", "Abstract": "To examine how childhood adversity (ie, parental death, parental divorce, suspension of school education due to financial strain or being raised in a relative's house due to financial strain) is associated with prevalence and incidence of adulthood depressive symptoms and whether this association differs by gender and by age in South Korea.\nProspective cohort design.\nNationally representative longitudinal survey in South Korea.\n11 526 participants in South Korea.\nPrevalence and incidence of adulthood depressive symptoms were assessed as a dichotomous variable using the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale in 2006 and 2007.\nIn the prevalence analysis, each of the four childhood adversities was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of adulthood depressive symptoms. The higher incidence of depressive symptoms was associated with suspension of school education (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.32\u00a0to 1.82) and parental divorce (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.71). In the age-stratified analyses, prevalence of depressive symptoms was associated with all CAs across different adulthoods, except for parental divorce and late adulthood depressive symptoms. After being stratified by gender, the association was significant for parental divorce (OR 3.76, 95% CI 2.34 to 6.03) in the prevalence analysis and for being raised in a relative's house (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.94) in the incidence analysis only among women.\nThis study suggests that childhood adversity may increase prevalence and incidence of adulthood depressive symptoms, and the impact of parental divorce or being raised in a relative's house due to financial strain on adulthood depressive symptoms may differ by gender."}, {"Title": "Assessment of the growth of epidural injections in the medicare population from 2000 to 2011.", "Abstract": "Among the many diagnostic and therapeutic interventions available for the management of chronic pain, epidural steroid injections are one of the most commonly used modalities. The explosive growth of this technique is relevant in light of the high cost of health care in the United States and abroad, the previous literature assessing the effectiveness of epidural injections has been sparse with highly variable outcomes based on technique, outcome measures, patient selection, and methodology. However, the recent assessment of fluoroscopically directed epidural injections has shown improved evidence with proper inclusion criteria, methodology, and outcome measures. The exponential growth of epidural injections is illustrated in multiple reports. The present report is an update of the analysis of the growth of epidural injections in the Medicare population from 2000 to 2011 in the United States.\nAnalysis of utilization patterns of epidural procedures in the Medicare population in the United States from 2000 to 2011.\nThe primary purpose of this assessment was to evaluate the use of all types of epidural injections (i.e., caudal, interlaminar, and transforaminal in the lumbar, cervical, and thoracic regions) with an assessment of specialty and regional characteristics.\nThis assessment was performed utilizing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Physician/Supplier Procedure Summary (PSPS) Master data from 2000 to 2011.\nEpidural injections in Medicare beneficiaries increased significantly from 2000 to 2011. Overall, epidural injections increased 130% per 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries with an annual increase of 7.5%. The increases per 100,000 Medicare recipients were 123% for cervical/thoracic interlaminar epidural injections; 25% for lumbar/sacral interlaminar, or caudal epidural injections; 142% for cervical/thoracic transforaminal epidural injections; and 665% for lumbar/sacral transforaminal epidural injections. The use of epidurals increased 224% in the radiologic specialties (interventional radiology and diagnostic radiology) and 145% in psychiatric settings, whereas and physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians' use of epidurals increased 520%.\nStudy limitatations include lack of inclusion of Medicare Advantage patients. In addition, the statewide data is based on claims which may include the contiguous or other states.\nEpidural injections in Medicare recipients increased significantly. The growth was significant for some specialties (radiology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and psychiatry) and for certain procedures (lumbosacral transforaminal epidural injections)."}, {"Title": "More equal societies have less mental illness: what should therapists do on Monday morning?", "Abstract": "Therapists seeing poor clients may ask if countries with greater income equality have less mental illness.

Research examining the psychosocial aspects of kidney disease has focussed predominantly on depressive disorders in dialysis patients where they are independently associated with increased risk of mortality and poor health-related quality of life. In contrast, studies examining the influence of psychosocial factors in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) prior to the initiation of renal replacement therapy are sparse. Limited data indicate that clinical depression and depressive symptoms are common and may independently predict progression to dialysis, hospitalization and death. In contrast, the influence of anxiety disorders, lower perceived social support and impaired health-related quality of life on the clinical course of CKD have received little attention. Large-scale prospective cohort studies are needed to clarify the burden and prognostic impact of these factors in this vulnerable population. Given the escalating burden of CKD worldwide examining the role of these potentially modifiable risk factors is crucial.

Specialty trainees do much of the medical student teaching during their clinical placements but infrequently receive instruction on how to teach. The two common approaches to increasing capacity are, first, establishing education rotations for individual trainees and, second, providing workshops to improve trainees' confidence and skill. Psychiatry trainees surveyed in New South Wales welcomed the role of teacher and the opportunity to improve their teaching capacity. Further support from supervisors, health services and medical schools is needed to assist trainees in their teaching role.\nThe role that trainees play as clinical teachers should be acknowledged and supported.

Net samples comprised 1927 employees in 14 of the 17 Norwegian Ministries.\nThe employees reported where they were at the time of the explosion. PTSD was assessed with the Norwegian version of the PTSD checklist (PCL).\nA total of 207 of the 1881 (11%) ministerial employees who completed the survey were present at work when the bomb exploded. Of these, a quarter (24%, 95% CI 18.4 to 30.0) had symptom levels equivalent to PTSD, while the prevalence was approximately 4% among those not present at work. In the latter group the prevalence was similar irrespective of whether their location was in Oslo, other places in Norway or abroad.

Previous studies reported that gatekeeper attitudes toward suicide could affect caregiving behaviors toward people at risk for suicide. Nevertheless, only few studies have examined the attitudes of pharmacists toward suicide.\nThis study explores the factors associated with the attitudes of pharmacists toward suicide.\nA self-administered questionnaire and written explanation of the study were mailed to 541 pharmacists who had registered for the Board Certified Psychiatry Pharmacy Specialist Seminar in Tokyo, Japan. A Japanese version of the Attitudes Toward Suicide questionnaire was used to assess participant attitudes toward suicide. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to assess relationships between participant attitudes toward suicide as well as demographics, occupational, and personal factors.\nParticipants who had previously received suicide-related education were more likely to have positive attitudes toward suicide prevention.

It has been known that key requirements could only be fulfilled on a regional basis, the Leipzig University Department of Psychiatry being an outstanding example, although its staff worked rather autonomously of the Rodewisch Theses.

Among Jaspers' contributions was his powerful vision of psychiatry as a crucial way to shed light on the human condition and existence by integrating the scientific study of psychic diseases with a theoretical approach focused on human experience. This perspective should be revitalized. In the present paper we start from the role Jaspers assigns to the body when discussing the notion of 'personalization'. We explore the relationship between a minimal notion of the self, the 'bodily self', and its potentiality for movement - the self's 'power for action'. Based on recent empirical evidence, we then propose a connection between the implicit bodily self-experience and important psychopathological aspects of schizophrenia by showing that schizophrenic patients exhibit a disruption of implicit bodily self-knowledge. We propose that the bodily nature of the implicitly experiencing self might enable the continuum of experience along which all visions of the world are located - both in healthy and psychotic individuals. The power for action might provide the possibility to give form to the bodily presence characterizing in the first place our being selves."}, {"Title": "Classification systems in psychiatry: diagnosis and global mental health in the era of DSM-5 and ICD-11.", "Abstract": "The development of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and- of the 11th edition of the International Classification of Disease (ICD-11) have led to renewed attention to the conceptual controversies surrounding the nosology of mental disorder. This article reviews recent work in this area, and suggests potential ways forward for psychiatric nosology, focusing in particular on the need for improved classification approaches for public and global mental health.\nDSM-5 and ICD-11 have taken somewhat different approaches, but both appropriately emphasize the importance of clinical utility and diagnosic validity in psychiatric nosology. The Research Domain Criteria framework provides a useful focus on the individual-level causal mechanisms that are relevant to vulnerability to mental disorder. An analogous approach to societal-level causal mechanisms would be useful from a public and global mental health perspective.\nIn their day-to-day work, clinicians will continue to use the fuzzy constructs operationally defined and narratively depicted in DSM-5 and ICD-11. Advances in our understanding of the individual-level and society-level causal mechanisms that contribute to vulnerability to mental disorder may ultimately lead to improved classification systems, and in turn to better individualized care as well as improved global mental health."}, {"Title": "A note on relevance of diagnostic classification and rating scales used in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In the clinical practice of psychology and psychiatry, presence or absence of particular disorder or syndromes is based on the subjective interpretation of mental and behavioral descriptions offered by the patient.

The study then examined whether similar findings were reproduced in a sample of people with psychotic disorders.\nLinear and hierarchical regressions were used to determine the role of metacognitive beliefs in the proneness to symptoms, whilst ANCOVAs analysed group differences.\nParticipants were recruited to a non-clinical sample (N = 133) and a psychosis sample (N = 100). Both groups completed the Launay-Slade Hallucinations Scale-Revised (Laroi et al., ; Eur. Psychiatry, 19, 15), the Peters Delusions Inventory (Peters et al., ; Schizophr. Bull., 25, 553), and the Metacognitions Questionnaire-30 (Wells & Cartwright-Hatton, ; Behav. Res. Ther., 42, 385).\nMetacognitions were predictive of both hallucination- and delusion-proneness in the non-clinical sample. Controlled analyses in the non-clinical sample revealed specific effects: low cognitive confidence (CC) predicted hallucination-proneness, whilst negative beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of thoughts (NBUD) predicted delusion-proneness. Mean ratings on NBUD, low CC, and need to control thoughts were elevated in the psychosis sample; however, after controlling for comorbid symptoms, no metacognitive belief predicted symptom-specific vulnerability in the clinical sample.\nThe pattern of findings provided little support for Morrison's theoretical model of symptom-proneness. Metacognitive beliefs may be related to sub-acute vulnerability to psychosis symptoms; however, the specificity of the relationship between individual metacognitive beliefs and positive psychosis symptoms appeared no longer significant in psychosis patients. The possibility that these metacognitive beliefs are evoked by psychotic experiences, rather than primarily functioning as a driver of them, warrants greater attention.\nMetacognitive beliefs appear at least equally associated with delusion-proneness as hallucination-proneness. Negative metacognitive beliefs appear more central to delusion-proneness than hallucination-proneness in the general population. When controlling for alternate symptom, no individual metacognitive belief appears reliably able to predict symptom-proneness in psychosis patients.\nConsistent with existing literature on metacognitions in psychosis, this study adopted a cross-sectional design, meaning we were unable to determine the causal direction of the observed associations between metacognitive beliefs and symptom-proneness. Although a strength of this study design was its control for alternate psychotic symptoms, we did not control for non-psychotic symptoms, particularly, anxiety and depression. The symptom measures used were developed primarily for assessment of psychosis-proneness within the general population; thus, their use by people with established psychosis may have been less sensitive to clinical manifestations of these phenomena."}, {"Title": "Attracting Child Psychiatrists to a Televideo Consultation Service: The TeleLink Experience.", "Abstract": "Objective. Identify aspects of psychiatry work that are rewarding, as well as those that are challenging, from the perspective of psychiatrists and residents participating in televideo consultation services. Method. A web-based survey was distributed to psychiatrists within the Division of Child Psychiatry at the University of Toronto. Also, semistructured interviews were conducted with six child psychiatrists providing services to a telepsychiatry program. Finally, a focus group interview was held with four psychiatry residents. Results. Child psychiatrists are very comfortable conducting assessments via televideo. Factors identified as being important in the decision to participate in telepsychiatry include assisting underserved communities, supportive administrative staff, enhanced rural provider capacity, financial incentives, and convenience. The study's qualitative phase identified four themes in the decision to participate in telepsychiatry: (1) organizational, (2) shared values, (3) innovation, and (4) the consultation model. Conclusion. The success of televideo consultation programs in attracting child psychiatrists to provide consultation services to underresourced communities makes an important contribution to psychiatric workforce shortages.

This study was undertaken to analyze the changes and how parents have experienced the diagnostic process in France. Data were obtained from in-depth interviews with parents and psychiatrists, and from 248 questionnaires with open-ended questions filled in by parents. We compared the experiences of parents with adult autistic children to those of parents with young autistic children. Progressively earlier age at diagnosis was evidenced. These changes occurred later than in North America and the UK, due to the reluctance of French professionals to adopt the new classifications of diseases which they viewed as undervaluing both the physician's holistic clinical skills, and psychoanalytical interpretations. Parents' experiences and interviews with psychiatrists were analyzed in order to document changes over time in the diagnostic process following tensions between parents and professionals, and intra-professional debates in psychiatry. Our data support the notion that the diagnosis of autism is historically and nationally contingent. The interactions between changes in the diagnostic process, policy, and parental experiences have led to changes in the way autism is defined, understood, and experienced."}, {"Title": "Subjectivity and schizophrenia: another look at incomprehensibility and treatment nonadherence.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry is in a time of crisis. The absence of significant breakthroughs to actionable etiological knowledge has left the discipline in a state of uncertainty and worries are being voiced about its status and future. In our view, the stagnation can be, at least in part, ascribed to an excessive, behaviorist-oriented, epistemological, and ontological simplification of psychopathology. The aim of this phenomenological study is to articulate the notion of the 'disordered self' in schizophrenia, a notion that we believe constitutes an important step forward in grasping its essential pathogenetic structures. Through the framework of self-disorders, we analyze two domains of the psychopathology of schizophrenia, seeking to recast their puzzling nature into more useful clinical and scientific terms. First, we examine the so-called schizophrenic incomprehensibility (bizarre gestalt, bizarre delusions, and 'crazy actions') and argue that grasping the altered framework for experiencing, associated with the disordered self, makes these phenomena appear comprehensible to a considerable extent. Second, we explore the issue of treatment noncompliance and provide a novel account of 'poor insight' into illness. We propose that poor insight into schizophrenia is not simply a problem of insufficient self- reflection due to psychological defenses or impaired metacognition, but rather that it is intrinsically expressive of the severity and nature of self-disorders. The instabilities of the first-person perspective throw the patient into a different, often quasisolipsistic, ontological-existential framework. We argue that interventions seeking to optimize the patients' compliance might prove more efficient if they take the alterations of the patients' ontological-existential framework into account."}, {"Title": "Prevalence and patterns of psychiatric disorders in referred adolescents with Internet addiction.", "Abstract": "To investigate prevalence and patterns of psychiatric disorders in young subjects with Internet addiction (IA).\nSubjects were taken from a sample of patients, aged 10-18 years old, referred to Istanbul Medical Faculty, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department due to a variety of behavioral and emotional problems alongside problematic Internet use.

All subjects (100%) had at least one and 88.3% (n\u2009=\u200953) had at least two comorbid psychiatric disorders. The frequency of diagnostic groups were as follows: behavioral disorder, n\u2009=\u200952 (86.7%); anxiety disorder, n\u2009=\u200943 (71.7%); mood disorder, n\u2009=\u200923 (38.3%); elimination disorder, n\u2009=\u200916 (26.7%); tic disorder, n\u2009=\u200910 (16.7%); and substance use disorder, n\u2009=\u20094 (6.7%). The most common psychiatric disorders were attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (n\u2009=\u200953; 83.3%), social phobia (n\u2009=\u200921; 35.0%) and major depressive disorder (n\u2009=\u200918; 30.0%).\nHigh rates of psychiatric comorbidity, particularly behavioral, anxiety and mood disorders were found in young subjects with IA. Because the presence of psychiatric disorders may affect the management /prognosis of IA, assessment should include that for other psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Personal reflections on a life of learning and teaching psychiatry.", "Abstract": "I have been actively learning and teaching psychiatry since starting residency in 1966. Over the decades my educational endeavours have been guided by a fairly consistent set of operating principles. Fortunate opportunities in several excellent psychiatry departments and national organizations have allowed me to experiment, and these principles have tested well. My objectives for this article are to review these principles and describe some educational activities that have provided notable pleasure and lasting satisfaction. Readers may wish to try out some of these ideas. They have worked for me, and they may work for others as well."}, {"Title": "New directions in medical education related to psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The 100-year anniversary of the Flexner report provides an opportunity to reflect on the future of medical education. We will consider the legacy of the original report, the centenary follow up to that report and consider how these, in concert with emerging learning theories, will influence medical education. We first provide a brief overview of the original Flexner report and review the recommendations of the 2010 centenary follow up to the report. We then discuss some of the major developments in learning theory and consider how they have influenced medical education. In general, there has been a gradual shift from passive to active methods, spurred in part by constructivist theories of learning. Many of the attitudes and skills required are particular strengths of the psychiatrist, making psychiatric educators particularly suitable to lead curricular change. Although much literature is devoted to determining the 'best' educational method, we take an ecumenical approach, suggesting that the various pedagogical approaches are all legitimate educational tools from which to choose. Each has its strength and limitations, and when designing a curriculum we should consider these when making pedagogical choices. We finish with some practical advice for those contemplating curricular change."}, {"Title": "Lessons from psychiatry and psychiatric education for medical learners and teachers.", "Abstract": "Medical learners, teachers, and institutions face significant challenges in health care delivery and in training the next generation of clinicians. We propose that psychiatry offers lessons which may help improve how we take care of patients and how we teach others to care for patients. Our objective is to discuss what learners and teachers can learn from psychiatry, organized around (1) how we make decisions, (2) how we learn, and (3) how we reflect on our practice. Information from clinical care, education, neuroscience and other aspects of life (e.g. business, creativity, and research) help us on these processes. We make 'good' decisions in concert with patients and learners, by listening to their experiences, asking questions and exploring subjective and objective information. Our learning has a neurobiological basis, and is effectively furthered by personalization, reinforcement, acquisition of critical thinking skills, and assessment of our limitations and errors. Our ability to reflect is determined by attitude, skill, tolerating ambiguity or dissonance, and planning for the unexpected. These processes - in addition to knowledge and other skills - will help physicians be successful in practice, learning and teaching, research and leadership."}, {"Title": "Impact of changes in psychiatric practice on psychiatric education in the USA.", "Abstract": "The evidence base for the field of psychiatry is rapidly changing in the twenty-first century due to advances in neuroscience that are in the process of being translated into clinical interventions. The delivery systems for mental healthcare are simultaneously undergoing dramatic transformations as the field attempts to meet population needs effectively and efficiently. These changes demand a reconsideration of the content and priorities of psychiatric training programmes for both medical students and residents. This article examines the current state of psychiatric practice, as well as future challenges and potential models of practice, and discusses how these changes are impacting the present needs of trainees. Preparing today's medical students and residents to be active participants in the creation of the mental healthcare delivery system of the future is the key to the success of the specialism and to the welfare of tomorrow's patients."}, {"Title": "Assessing competencies during education in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The utilization of competencies in medical education is relatively recent. In 1999 the United States Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) established six main competencies. Since then, the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology have approved a specific list of competencies for their specialities in each of the ACGME's core competency areas. Assessment of competencies in both medical students and residents can be achieved through such methods as structured case discussion, direct observation, simulation, standardized patients, and 360-degree assessments, etc. Each assessment methodology has specific applications in the discipline of psychiatry. This paper reviews the different methods for assessing competencies with specific examples in psychiatric education. It is not intended as a comprehensive review of all assessment methods, but to provide examples and strategies to guide psychiatric educators in their practice. Students and residents were intentionally separated because there are differences in the teaching goals and objectives, and thus in the assessment purposes and design. Students are general, undifferentiated physicians-in-training who need to learn about psychiatric nosology, examinations, and treatment. Residents are mental health professionals who need more in-depth supervision in order to hone skills in all the specialized areas that arise in psychiatric practices, making supervision a vital part of residency programs."}, {"Title": "Stepping stones for psychiatry residents who pursue scientific research careers.", "Abstract": "Advances in areas of neuroscience are highly relevant to psychiatric disorders but there exists a gap between discoveries in neuroscience and the practice of clinical psychiatry. Psychiatry is a field in need of high impact research conducted by physician-scientists who have first-hand experience treating patients with mental illness and who use this clinical knowledge to improve and discover better or novel interventions. This paper focuses primarily on the training of psychiatry residents for successful scientific research careers and what residency programmes and others can do to help them succeed. Changes also need to be made at a regulatory level to enhance the research training and literacy of psychiatry residents. The shortage of psychiatrists who are well trained in basic and translational research can only be remedied if the path to becoming an independent investigator is lined with stepping stones that support success, including during the residency years. Partnerships among funding agencies, professional societies and training institutions can lay the groundwork for our psychiatric trainees to stay on the path to rewarding scientific research careers."}, {"Title": "Educating psychiatry residents in neuropsychiatry and neuroscience.", "Abstract": "Neuropsychiatry and psychiatric neuroscience should be part of the general psychiatry curriculum so that graduate psychiatrists will be able to allow their patients the benefit of neuroscientifically informed diagnosis and treatment.

Thirty-three IMHP were recruited from outpatient and day clinics at the psychiatry department of a university hospital within a 5-month time period for this qualitative, descriptive study. Data were gathered using a structured interview form with open-ended questions to explore the changes in everyday life experienced by IMHP during the course of their illness. Data were analysed using the Colaizzi method of analysis. Our findings show that almost all IMHP were concerned about being stigmatized by others, society, their family, and health care professionals. Another concern that IMHP reported was self-stigmatization. Stigmatization serves as a barrier to treatment adherence and socialization in IMHP. Furthermore, stigmatization has a significant impact on the lives of IMHP, and methods of coping with stigmatization are commonly ineffective. However, stigmatization can be reduced by dealing with the illness, IMHP, their relatives, and professionals in an unprejudiced manner."}, {"Title": "[Development of forensic psychiatry in Serbia].", "Abstract": "The development of legislation in the field of mental health in our region is linked with the emergence and development of the oldest psychiatric hospitals in Serbia.The principle that the mentally ill who committed a criminal offense need to be placed in a psychiatric hospital instead of a prison was introduced at the same time as in the most developed European countries. The founders of the Serbian forensic psychiatry, Dr. Jovan Dani\u0107, Dr.Vojislav Suboti\u0107 Jr. and Dr. Dusan Suboti\u0107, were all trained at the first Serbian Psychiatric Hospital (\"Home for the Unsound of Mind\") that was founded in 1861 in the part of Belgrade called Guberevac.

It is believed that the God is Lord Shiva and the woman part is his consort Goddess Parvati or Shakti. The Ardhanareeshvara represents a constructive and generative power. Ardhanareeshvara symbolizes male and female principles cannot be separated. It conveys the unity of opposites in the universe. The male half stands for Purusha and female half is Prakriti. Ardhanareeshvara harmonizes the two conflicting ways of life: The spiritual way of the ascetic as represented by Shiva, and the materialistic way of the householder symbolized by Parvati. It conveys that Shiva and Shakti are one and the same. A human being is not a pure unisexual organism. Each human organism bears the potentiality of both male and female sex. Neurohormonal mechanisms have been found to be greatly influencing the sexual behavior.

In schizophrenia patients, yoga has benefits as an add-on intervention in pharmacologically stabilized subjects. The effects are particularly notable on negative symptoms. Yoga also helps to correct social cognition. Yoga can be introduced early in the treatment of psychosis with some benefits. Elevation of oxytocin may be a mechanism of yoga effects in schizophrenia.

In recent years, there has been an increased interest in studies examining competence for treatment in psychiatric patients. In this study, we aimed to investigate the decision-making competencies of inpatients with a range of psychiatric diseases.\nThis study was carried out at the psychiatry clinic of Kocaeli University Hospital in Turkey from June 2007 to February 2008. Decision-making competence was assessed in 83 patients using the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool-Treatment (MacCAT-T).\nThe study groups consisted of patients with mood (39.8%), psychotic (27.7%) and anxiety disorders (18.1%), and alcohol/substance addiction (14.5%). There was a significant relation between decision-making competence and demographic and clinical characteristics. Appreciation of the given information was more impaired in psychotic disorder patients than in other patients, but understanding and reasoning of the given information was similar in all groups.\nThese results reveal the importance of evaluating decision-making competencies of psychiatric patients before any treatment or intervention is carried out to ascertain their ability to give informed consent to treatment.

It is not legally regulated because no illicit ingredients have been detected in the drug by conventional screening tests. It is easily obtained via the Internet or from street vendors. As the population abusing this drug has grown, medical problems such as psychosis, disturbances of consciousness caused by acute intoxication, and social problems such as traffic accidents while under the influence of the drug have been increasingly reported. However, few psychiatric symptoms associated with it have been identified, and little is known about the psychosocial features of abusers. The purpose of the present study was to examine the clinical and psychosocial features of outpatients with dappou herb use disorder.\nSubjects were 15 male outpatients with dappou herb use disorder who had their first medical examination at the Drug Dependence Clinic in the Center Hospital, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry between November 2009 and April 2012. The control group comprised 28 age-matched oupatients who had methamphetamine use disorder, the most serious drug-related problem in Japan since the 1950s. They underwent their first medical examination at the same clinic during the same time frame as the study subjects. Clinical and psychosocial information on subjects and controls including life histories (educational, occupational, and criminal) and clinical information (history of psychoactive substance use, access to the mainly abused drug, and DSM-IV diagnoses of substance use disorder and comorbid psychiatric disorders) were collected from medical records. These variables were compared between the two groups.\nAnalyses revealed differences in the life history and clinical characteristics between the subjects and controls. The subjects had a higher level of education, more work experience, and a less marked history of anti-social behavior other than illicit drug use and possession than the controls. However, a clinical history of psychiatric disorders, other than substance-related disorders, before drug abuse began was more frequently found in the subjects than in the controls.\nThe present study demonstrates that patients with dappou herb use disorder may differ from those with methamphetamine use disorder in terms of their background, psychosocial factors, and clinical features. These findings suggest that the dappou herb may be creating a new type of drug abuser in Japan. Our study also indicates that some patients abusing this herb may have been \"self-medicating\" for symptoms of other psychiatric disorders such as depression or anxiety, given that they were more likely to have received psychiatric treatment before the start of drug abuse. This suggests that the legal regulation of this drug as well as early comprehensive intervention for adolescents with mental health problems may be required to prevent abuse of the dappou herb. Two limitations of this study should be noted. The definition of the dappou herb was vague because the ingredients are still unclear. In addition, the sample size of this study was very small. However, no studies using larger samples have been reported in Japan. Future studies that overcome these limitations are needed."}, {"Title": "Assessing the comparative effectiveness of long-acting injectable vs. oral antipsychotic medications in the prevention of relapse provides a case study in comparative effectiveness research in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "As psychopathology and social functioning can worsen with repeated psychotic episodes in schizophrenia, relapse prevention is critical. Because high nonadherence rates limit the efficacy of pharmacotherapy, the use of long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics is considered an important treatment option. To date, many studies comparing LAIs and oral antipsychotics have been conducted; however, the results are mixed, and careful interpretation of the data is required.\nSelective review of existing literature regarding LAIs. We especially focused the discussion on the impact of the design of studies with different approaches comparing LAIs and oral antipsychotics in preventing relapse.\nThe results were diverse and were influenced by the design used, that is, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed LAIs and oral antipsychotics to have similar effects, whereas mirror-image and some large cohort studies showed LAIs to be superior to oral antipsychotics.\nDivergent results from studies using different methodologies create a dilemma for comparative effectiveness research, and LAI studies may serve as an example of a situation in which a conventional RCT is not the gold standard. Traditional RCTs generally increase adherence compared with clinical practice and, therefore, might not be well suited to detect differences between LAIs and oral medications, because any increase in adherence affects patients on oral medications more than those on LAIs and thus leads to an underestimation of any potential difference in effectiveness. A possible solution would be the implementation of a true effectiveness trial in which post-randomization involvement would be kept to a minimum to better reflect routine practice."}, {"Title": "The use of clinical trials in comparative effectiveness research on mental health.", "Abstract": "A large body of comparative effectiveness research (CER) focuses on the use of observational and quasi-experimental approaches. We sought to examine the use of clinical trials as a tool for CER, particularly in mental health.\nExamination of three ongoing randomized clinical trials in psychiatry addressing issues that would pose difficulties for nonexperimental CER methods.\nExisting statistical approaches to nonexperimental data appear insufficient to compensate for biases that may arise when the pattern of missing data cannot be properly modeled such as when there are no standards for treatment, when affected populations have limited access to treatment, or when there are high rates of treatment dropout.\nClinical trials should retain an important role in CER, particularly in cases of high disorder prevalence, large expected effect sizes, difficult-to-reach populations, or when examining sequential treatments or stepped-care algorithms. Progress in CER on mental health will require careful consideration of appropriate selection between clinical trials and nonexperimental designs and on allocation of research resources to optimally inform key treatment decisions for each patient."}, {"Title": "Jung's archetype, 'The Wounded Healer', mental illness in the medical profession and the role of the health humanities in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Carl Jung used the term, 'The Wounded Healer' as an archetype to describe doctors who have suffered from an illness. Reading and writing autobiographical narratives of the 'Wounded Healer' is gaining popularity among doctors with mental illness as an effective form of adjunctive therapy. Moreover, reading autobiographical narratives of psychopathology sufferers can 'augment' service providers' humanity by offering valuable qualitative insights into minds afflicted with a psychiatric disorder. The primary author, a doctor of Middle-Eastern descent practicing in the UK, composed an autobiographical narrative about his personal experiences with oscillations in his mood in an attempt to illustrate the cultural, religious and psychosocial factors that influence disease detection, progression, treatment and outcome. An inordinate amount of misconceptions about mental illness abound. We hope that this manuscript will help to lessen the stigma associated with those who suffer from psychopathology (particularly doctors) and encourage sufferers to engage with the appropriate services."}, {"Title": "The 100 top-cited articles published in psychiatric journals.", "Abstract": "An examination of top-cited articles is a tool that can be used to identify and monitor outstanding scientific research. The goal of this study was to identify and analyze the characteristics of the 100 top-cited articles published in international journals dedicated to psychiatry. The Science Citation Index Expanded provided by the Thomson Reuters Institute for Scientific Information Web of Knowledge was searched in December, 2011, and 128 journals were identified in the subject category \"Psychiatry.\" Each journal was searched on the Web of Science under \"Publication Name\" and the results were sorted by category \"Times Cited.\" The 100 top-cited articles were recorded, and the list was analyzed with regard to journals, number of citations, authors, year, institution, and country of origin. The original research articles of the 100 top-cited articles were classified into one of five categories: scale/measurement, descriptive/epidemiology, mechanism, management, and imaging. The 100 top-cited articles were cited between 26,578 and 781 times; they were published between 1957 and 2005, with the largest number (35) published in the 1990s. The articles appeared in 24 journals, with more than half published in the Archives of General Psychiatry (56), followed by the American Journal of Psychiatry (6), and Psychological Medicine (6). Articles that dealt with the development, application, or validity of measurements led the list of top-cited psychiatric publications (43) and had a significantly higher number of citations compared with the rest of the articles. The time and language of publication, field of study, country of origin, and journal in which the paper appeared are possible determinants of the likelihood of citation and impact."}, {"Title": "A model for therapeutic risk management of the suicidal patient.", "Abstract": "While the practice of psychiatry involves many challenges, few scenarios are as clinically and emotionally demanding as managing the patient who is at high risk for suicide. Risk management is a reality of psychiatric practice, and this necessitates practicing and documenting thoughtful suicide risk assessment and management. Therapeutic risk management is based on clinical risk management that is patient-centered, supportive of the treatment process, and maintains the therapeutic alliance. In this article, the authors present a broad overview of a model for achieving therapeutic risk management of the suicidal patient that involves augmenting clinical risk assessment with structured instruments, stratifying risk in terms of both severity and temporality, and developing and documenting a safety plan. These elements are readily accessible to and deployable by mental health clinicians in most disciplines and treatment settings, and they collectively yield a suicide risk assessment and management process (and attendant documentation) that should withstand the scrutiny that often occurs in the wake of a patient suicide or suicide attempt."}, {"Title": "Fungal hallucinogens psilocin, ibotenic acid, and muscimol: analytical methods and biologic activities.", "Abstract": "Psychoactive drugs of fungal origin, psilocin, ibotenic acid, and muscimol among them have been proposed for recreational use and popularized since the 1960s, XX century. Despite their well-documented neurotoxicity, they reached reputation of being safe and nonaddictive. Scientific efforts to find any medical application for these hallucinogens in psychiatry, psychotherapy, and even for religious rituals support are highly controversial. Even if they show any healing potential, their usage in psychotherapy is in some cases inadequate and may additionally harm seriously suffering patients. Hallucinogens are thought to reduce cognitive functions. However, in case of indolealkylamines, such as psilocin, some recent findings suggest their ability to improve perception and mental skills, what would motivate the consumption of \"magic mushrooms.\" The present article offers an opportunity to find out what are the main symptoms of intoxication with mushrooms containing psilocybin/psilocin, muscimol, and ibotenic acid. The progress in analytical methods for detection of them in fungal material, food, and body fluids is reviewed. Findings on the mechanisms of their biologic activity are summarized. Additionally, therapeutic potential of these fungal psychoactive compounds and health risk associated with their abuse are discussed."}, {"Title": "PET neuroimaging of extrastriatal dopamine receptors and prefrontal cortex functions.", "Abstract": "The role of prefrontal dopamine D1 receptors in prefrontal cortex (PFC) functions, including working memory, is widely investigated. However, human (healthy volunteers and schizophrenia patients) positron emission tomography (PET) studies about the relationship between prefrontal D1 receptors and PFC functions are somewhat inconsistent. We argued that several factors including an inverted U-shaped relationship between prefrontal D1 receptors and PFC functions might be responsible for these inconsistencies. In contrast to D1 receptors, relatively less attention has been paid to the role of D2 receptors in PFC functions. Several animal and human pharmacological studies have reported that the systemic administration of D2 receptor agonist/antagonist modulates PFC functions, although those studies do not tell us which region(s) is responsible for the effect. Furthermore, while prefrontal D1 receptors are primarily involved in working memory, other PFC functions such as set-shifting seem to be differentially modulated by dopamine. PET studies of extrastriatal D2 receptors including ours suggested that orchestration of prefrontal dopamine transmission and hippocampal dopamine transmission might be necessary for a broad range of normal PFC functions. In order to understand the complex effects of dopamine signaling on PFC functions, measuring a single index related to basic dopamine tone is not sufficient. For a better understanding of the meanings of PET indices related to neurotransmitters, comprehensive information (presynaptic, postsynaptic, and beyond receptor signaling) will be required. Still, an interdisciplinary approach combining molecular imaging techniques with cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychiatry will provide new perspectives for understanding the neurobiology of neuropsychiatric disorders and their innovative drug developments."}, {"Title": "Prison suicides in Germany from 2000 to 2011.", "Abstract": "In many countries, suicide is the most frequent cause of prison deaths; moreover, the respective national penal suicide rates are consistently several times higher than the suicide rates in the general population. To assess the situation in German prisons, an assessment of all suicides in German prisons by means of a survey was carried out for the time from 2000 to 2011. The mean rate per year of prison suicides in Germany from 2000 to 2011 was 105.8 per 100,000 male inmates and 54.7 per 100,000 female inmates. Male prisoner suicide rates significantly declined during the period under investigation; no significant trend was evident for female prisoners in pre-trial detention but a noteworthy increase was apparent in the suicide rate of female sentenced prisoners. A significant positive relationship can be demonstrated between occupation density and the suicide rate for both men and women. These results should be taken as a challenge for further research on the reasons for the unexpected increase of suicide rate in female sentenced prisoners and as well on the effect of population density on prison suicide rate."}, {"Title": "How do you know your consult service is doing a good job? Generating performance measures for C-L service effectiveness.", "Abstract": "There is no consensus in the literature on measures for evaluating the performance of general hospital Consultation-Liaison psychiatry services.\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate what indicators might be used to this end.\nWe surveyed United States Psychosomatic Medicine fellowship directors (n = 53) about the use of performance measures for their psychiatric consultation services. Results of this survey led to the construction of a second survey, which was distributed to the representatives of services calling for psychiatric consultations at our hospital (n = 21); this survey sought to determine the importance of various performance parameters to overall consultee satisfaction.\nSixty-three percent of responding psychiatric consult services do not use any of the parameters identified in the literature as performance measures. Consultee satisfaction was endorsed as a valuable performance indicator by 67.7% of them, but no satisfaction rating instrument was identified. The internal survey of consultees identified 11 of 16 candidate parameters as important or very important to consultee satisfaction, of which \"consultant understands the core situation and the core question being asked\" received the highest rating.\nConsultee satisfaction is perceived as a useful global measure of the effectiveness of a psychiatric consult service. We elicited parameters that can be used to create a measurement tool for consultee satisfaction with Consultation-Liaison services. The use of such a tool merits testing in a larger multicenter study."}, {"Title": "[Feeding disorders in infants and toddlers: advantages of a joint consultation with pediatrician and psychologist].", "Abstract": "Feeding disorders and food refusal can be found in 25% of infants, a minority of these disorders has an organic explanation.

However, since the publication of its first version in 1952, controversies have been raised concerning its reliability and validity and the need for other novel clinical tools has emerged. Currently the DSM is in its fourth edition and a new fifth edition is expected for release in 2013, in an intense intellectual debate and in a call for new proposals. Since 1952, psychiatry has undergone many changes and is emerging as unique field in the medical area in which a novel approach is being demanded for properly treating patients: not the classical \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach, but a more targeted and tailored diagnosis and therapeutics, taking into account the complex interactions among genes and their products, environment, culture and the psychological apparatus of the subject. OMICS sciences, being based on high-throughput technologies, are systems biology related fields (like genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics and so on). In the frame of the P5 medicine (personalized, participatory, predictive, preventive, psycho-cognitive), they could establish links between psychiatric diseases, which are disorders with a final common symptomatology with vastly heterogeneous biological, environmental and sociological underpinnings, and by understanding the psychiatric diseases beyond their classic symptomatic or syndromal definitions using OMICS research, one can have a broader picture and unprecedented links and reclassification of psychiatric nosology. Importantly, by understanding the basis of heterogeneity in diseases through OMICS research, one could also personalize treatment of psychiatric illnesses. In this manuscript, we discuss a gap in the current psychiatric research, namely the missing logical link among OMICS, personalized medicine and reclassification of diseases. Moreover, we explore the importance of incorporating OMICS-based quantitative dimensional criteria, besides the classical qualitative and categorical approach."}, {"Title": "Defending the indefensible? Psychiatry, assisted suicide and human freedom.", "Abstract": "The siege guns of the forces for change to euthanasia and assisted suicide laws have been pounding for decades, but the longstanding proscription on these practices has held out in all but a few jurisdictions. A few psychiatrists have enlisted with the challengers, but many remain on the battlements, defending the impermissibility of active assistance in dying. Given the long history of the separation of church and state and the significant secularisation of society; the recognition by the law of both acts and omissions as legal causes; lenient sentences for mercy killers; critiques of the \"psychiatriatisation\" of different aspects of life; and the consistency of public opinion, this recalcitrant stand bespeaks undercurrents and positions that are often by rationalised or camouflaged, and which call for exploration. In this paper, I examine connections between psychiatry and conceptualisations of harm, suffering and natural death; medicalisation, psychiatrisation and medical paternalism; decision-making capacity, rationality and diagnosis; recent legal developments; social pluralism; and religious intuitionism. I conclude that psychiatrists and the psychiatry profession, concerned as they are with enlarging the province of human freedom, should begin a more transparent rapprochement with those they would repel."}, {"Title": "Maternal behavior in basic science: translational research and clinical applicability.", "Abstract": "Clinical aspects of the mother-infant relationship and related issues are well studied and very relevant to medical practice. Nevertheless, some approaches in this context cannot plausibly be investigated in humans due to their ethical implications and to the potential harm to the mother's and child's health. Studies on maternal behavior in animals have evident importance to some clinical fields, such as psychiatry and psychology, particularly considering topics, including mother-infant relationship, postpartum depression, cognitive and behavioral development of children, and associated issues. Hence, this theoretical article draws attention to the clinical applicability of studies about maternal behavior in animals to psychobiology, taking into account a translational perspective."}, {"Title": "An integrated clinical pharmacology approach for deriving dosing recommendations in a regulatory setting: review of recent cases in psychiatry drugs.", "Abstract": "Clinical pharmacology as an interdisciplinary science is unique in its capacity and the diversity of the methods and approaches it can provide to derive dosing recommendations in various subpopulations. This article illustrates cases where an integrated clinical pharmacology approach was used to derive dosing recommendations for psychiatry drugs within regulatory settings. The integrated approach is based on the view that once a drug is shown to be effective in the general population, it is reasonable to take into consideration other relevant findings and the use of alternative scientific tools and analysis to derive dosing recommendations in specific populations. The method provides useful means to solve the challenges of the paucity of available data and lead to clear dosing instructions. This in turn expands the benefits of any given drug to all individuals in which the drug is likely to be effective."}, {"Title": "Mass spectrometry strategies for clinical metabolomics and lipidomics in psychiatry, neurology, and neuro-oncology.", "Abstract": "Metabolomics research has the potential to provide biomarkers for the detection of disease, for subtyping complex disease populations, for monitoring disease progression and therapy, and for defining new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. These potentials are far from being realized because of a number of technical, conceptual, financial, and bioinformatics issues. Mass spectrometry provides analytical platforms that address the technical barriers to success in metabolomics research; however, the limited commercial availability of analytical and stable isotope standards has created a bottleneck for the absolute quantitation of a number of metabolites. Conceptual and financial factors contribute to the generation of statistically under-powered clinical studies, whereas bioinformatics issues result in the publication of a large number of unidentified metabolites. The path forward in this field involves targeted metabolomics analyses of large control and patient populations to define both the normal range of a defined metabolite and the potential heterogeneity (eg, bimodal) in complex patient populations. This approach requires that metabolomics research groups, in addition to developing a number of analytical platforms, build sufficient chemistry resources to supply the analytical standards required for absolute metabolite quantitation. Examples of metabolomics evaluations of sulfur amino-acid metabolism in psychiatry, neurology, and neuro-oncology and of lipidomics in neurology will be reviewed."}, {"Title": "Hyponatraemia: an audit of aged psychiatry patients taking SSRIs and SNRIs.", "Abstract": "Hyponatraemia is a serious adverse event commonly reported in elderly people treated with serotonergic antidepressants. The mechanism, incidence and risk factors for antidepressant induced hyponatraemia are not fully understood.\nIn a retrospective chart analysis, depressed patients aged >63 years were investigated for change in serum sodium levels between two time points, separated by a median period of 45.5 days, with the first specimen taken prior to treatment. Patients were grouped into three cohorts; treated with an SSRI or SNRI (n=77), treated with an antidepressant other than an SSRI or SNRI (n=54) and not treated with an antidepressant (n=128).\nFor change in sodium level between measurements and total number of patients with hyponatraemia, there was no significant difference between cohorts. However, the rate of reduction of serum sodium levels between time points was significantly greater for SSRI and SNRI treated patients (p<0.001) and patients treated with other antidepressants (p=0.03) compared to patients not treated with antidepressants. Moreover, the distribution of values of change in serum sodium was skewed towards reduced serum sodium in patients treated with SSRI or SNRIs (skew -0.43) and patients treated with other antidepressants (skew -0.09) but not for patients without antidepressants (skew 0.25).\nThese data suggest that antidepressant treatment is associated with hyponatraemia affecting a subgroup of individuals only. Generalised linear modelling showed that the risk of hyponatraemia increases with increased age, female gender, and particularly the antidepressant agents sertraline and escitalopram. The findings are of clinical significance as they demonstrate that hyponatraemia can occur rapidly with antidepressants, and SSRI/SNRI medications induce more rapid changes. They support the use of electrolyte monitoring early in antidepressant treatment in patients receiving antidepressants."}, {"Title": "Enuresis and more.", "Abstract": "We describe Pervasive Refusal Syndrome, an important but rare, debilitating condition that may present to paediatric services.

Suicide prevention strategies are more likely to be seen as the domain of psychiatry and a wealth of psychiatric literature is devoted to identifying and managing suicide risk. Whether or not suicide can be deemed permissible is ostensibly linked to discussions of autonomy and mental capacity, and UK legislation directs that a patient's wishes must be respected with regard to treatment refusal where decisional capacity is intact. In the context of the care and treatment of those with physical disorders, extreme and untreatable physical suffering is likely to be accepted as rational grounds for suicide, where the person possesses cognitive coherence and an ability to realistically appreciate the consequences of his or her actions. In the case of those with serious mental disorder, the grounds for accepting that suicide is rational are however less clear-cut. Serious mental illness is typically conceived of as a coercive pressure which prevents rational deliberation and as such, the suicides of those with serious mental illness are considered to be substantially non-voluntary acts arising from constitutive irrationality. Therefore, where an appropriate clinician judges that a person with serious mental disorder is non-autonomous, suicide prevention is likely to be thought legally and morally justified. There are arguably, two questionable assumptions in the position that psychiatry adopts: Firstly, that psychogenic pain is in some way less real than physical pain and secondly, that mental illness invariably means that a desire to die is irrational and inauthentic. If it can be shown that some people with serious mental illness can be rational with regard to suicide and that psychological pain is of equal significance as physical suffering, then it may be possible to conclude that some persons with serious mental illness should not by definition be excluded from the class of those for whom rational suicide may be a coherent choice."}, {"Title": "[Knowledge of German neurologists on migraine around 1890. Paul Julius M\u00f6bius and his 1894 monograph Die Migr\u00e4ne].", "Abstract": "Paul Julius M\u00f6bius (1853-1907), a Leipzig-based author and editor on a vast majority of subjects, has often been acknowledged as a leading 19th-century German neurologist. His impact on the development of knowledge on migraine has likewise been pointed to. This study compares the monograph published by M\u00f6bius on the illness in 1894 with contemporary publications and with present day best practice to establish if the author really made an essential contribution to the problem of migraine. As a representative of the central theory M\u00f6bius assumed that migraine was caused by aberrations in the brain. At the same time he made it clear that due to very limited diagnostic options this was only a hypothesis. Apart from a genetic factor and these cerebral changes, for M\u00f6bius the general state of health was a decisive factor and prevention and change in lifestyle therefore played a crucial role in his therapeutic recommendations. Basically there were only few differences between the views of M\u00f6bius and his colleagues, the major dissimilarity being that M\u00f6bius postulated a merely suggestive impact but no physical effect of electrotherapy. Although M\u00f6bius's monograph on migraine lacks originality, it provides a concise, easy to understand and stylistically impressive overview on the state of knowledge at that time. Therefore, the book can be considered as a benchmark publication of German speaking neurology around 1890 on migraine and it is highly recommended to present day headache and migraine researchers as well as historians of psychiatry and neurology."}, {"Title": "Barriers to implementing the DSM-5 cultural formulation interview: a qualitative study.", "Abstract": "The Outline for Cultural Formulation (OCF) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) marked an attempt to apply anthropological concepts within psychiatry. The OCF has been criticized for not providing guidelines to clinicians. The DSM-5 Cultural Issues Subgroup has since converted the OCF into the Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) for use by any clinician with any patient in any clinical setting. This paper presents perceived barriers to CFI implementation in clinical practice reported by patients (n = 32) and clinicians (n = 7) at the New York site within the DSM-5 international field trial. We used an implementation fidelity paradigm to code debriefing interviews after each CFI session through deductive content analysis. The most frequent patient threats were lack of differentiation from other treatments, lack of buy-in, ambiguity of design, over-standardization of the CFI, and severity of illness. The most frequent clinician threats were lack of conceptual relevance between intervention and problem, drift from the format, repetition, severity of patient illness, and lack of clinician buy-in. The Subgroup has revised the CFI based on these barriers for final publication in DSM-5. Our findings expand knowledge on the cultural formulation by reporting the CFI's reception among patients and clinicians."}, {"Title": "An insulinoma presenting with hypochondriac delusions and food refusal.", "Abstract": "The authors report a case of a 68-year-old man with an unrecognized insulinoma manifesting with neuropsychiatric symptoms. For two years, he presented with unspecified behavior changes, autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms, which led him to be misdiagnosed with a neurologic and psychiatric disorder before the insulinoma was recognized. Following neurological alterations in context of hypoglycemia, subsequent to longstanding food refusal, he was admitted in the psychiatric ward. Despite good global response and normal food intake, hypoglycemic episodes were still occurring and led to a careful evaluation which permitted the definitive diagnostic. This case highlights the diagnostic difficulties of medical disorders presenting with clinical features overlapping neurological and psychiatric syndromes. It also reflects the diagnostic difficulties in rare clinical entities, particularly in patients previously followed in psychiatry and underlines the need for a constant dialogue and updating of clinicians."}, {"Title": "Burnout in medical students: a systematic review.", "Abstract": "Burnout is a state of mental and physical exhaustion related to work or care-giving activities. Distress during medical school can lead to burnout, with significant consequences, particularly if burnout continues into residency and beyond.

We ultimately offer some suggestions to address and potentially ameliorate the current dilemma posed by burnout during medical education.\nA literature review was conducted using a PubMed/Medline, and PsycInfo search from 1974 to 2011 using the keywords: 'burnout', 'stress', 'well-being', 'self-care', 'psychiatry' and 'medical students'. Three authors agreed independently on the studies to be included in this review.\nThe literature reveals that burnout is prevalent during medical school, with major US multi-institutional studies estimating that at least half of all medical students may be affected by burnout during their medical education. Studies show that burnout may persist beyond medical school, and is, at times, associated with psychiatric disorders and suicidal ideation. A variety of personal and professional characteristics correlate well with burnout. Potential interventions include school-based and individual-based activities to increase overall student well-being.\nBurnout is a prominent force challenging medical students' well-being, with concerning implications for the continuation of burnout into residency and beyond. To address this highly prevalent condition, educators must first develop greater awareness and understanding of burnout, as well as of the factors that lead to its development.

However, since 1960 the population of people identifying as American Indian in the United States has grown faster than can be explained by birth rates, raising questions about the personal meaning of identity for newly self-designated American Indians. For this research, interviews were conducted with 14 self-identified American Indian clients receiving rural mental health care services in the Midwest. The goal was to assess clients' cultural connection to their racial identity and to understand what impact their American Indian identity had on their mental health care experiences. A modified Consensual Qualitative Research (CQR) method was used to develop the interview protocol and code responses. Interview data revealed that clients primarily based their racial identity on family stories of an American Indian ancestor and the majority did not feel their identification as American Indian was relevant to their mental health care. Regardless of lack of cultural connection, participants often reported feeling personal pride associated with identifying as American Indian. Implications for both researchers collecting self-reported race data and for mental health practitioners who might serve self-identified American Indian clients are discussed."}, {"Title": "An evaluation of knowledge, attitude and practices about prescribing fixed dose combinations among resident doctors.", "Abstract": "Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs) improve patient compliance and decrease pill burden.

Drawing on qualitative semistructured interviews, this paper examines the experiences of informal interpreters working within a psychiatric setting. Furthermore, this paper explores how working in this invisible capacity affects informal interpreters' views of themselves and the contribution they feel they are making by acting as interpreters. An interpretative phenomenological approach enabled an in-depth analysis of the experiences of the ad hoc interpreters. The results of this study reveal a dilemma. On the one hand, informal interpreters interviewed jeopardize ethical principles by breaching confidentiality and reporting on patient behaviour without their consent. On the other hand, they report fulfilling an additional beneficial role in terms of the overall care of patients which goes beyond the ambit of the interpreting session. The impact and extent of the informal interpreters' involvement in care could not be ascertained solely from the data obtained in this study, but it is clear that informal interpreting may usefully be viewed as a form of hidden care work. A detailed ethnographic study aimed at exploring this further is therefore recommended."}, {"Title": "A clinical study of the cognitive effects of benzodiazepines in psychogeriatric patients.", "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown cognitive impairment in long-term benzodiazepine users compared to non-users. However, little is known about such effects in a population of geriatric psychiatry patients. The aim of this study was to identify differences between benzodiazepine users and non-users on standardized tests of the cognitive fields of learning and memory, executive functions and vigilance, at admittance to a department of geriatric psychiatry.Hopkins verbal learning test, Stroop test and digit vigilance test were performed in all patients. Test performances were compared between benzodiazepine users (n=168) and non-users (n=73). A multiple linear regression model was used, adjusting for different baseline characteristics (years of education, dementia and depression).No significant differences in test results were found between benzodiazepine users and non-users on 11 out of 12 cognitive tests results. On one of the 12 test results (time used on the digit vigilance test), benzodiazepine users showed better performance compared to non-users (\u03b2=-0.20, p=0.032). This finding was not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.This study of geriatric psychiatry benzodiazepine users did not reveal cognitive impairment compared to non-users on the cognitive areas tested.

The current study aimed to compare these outcomes to a group of patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). A retrospective review of patients admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit identified 19 patients with IGE and 23 patients with TLE who underwent neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluations. Patients with IGE required a longer time to complete the Trail Making Tests and had lower performance IQ compared to patients with TLE. Despite a higher burden of convulsions, patients with IGE had lower depression scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) than patients with TLE. In the group with IGE, the BDI-II scores were inversely correlated with epilepsy duration. These findings indicate that patients with IGE have lower performance IQ, impaired performance on tests of executive functioning, and lower depression scores compared to patients with TLE, implicating different pathophysiological processes."}, {"Title": "Chromatin-bound RNA and the neurobiology of psychiatric disease.", "Abstract": "A large, and still rapidly expanding literature on epigenetic regulation in the nervous system has provided fundamental insights into the dynamic regulation of DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications in the context of neuronal plasticity in health and disease. Remarkably, however, very little is known about the potential role of chromatin-bound RNAs, including many long non-coding transcripts and various types of small RNAs. Here, we provide an overview on RNA-mediated regulation of chromatin structure and function, with focus on histone lysine methylation and psychiatric disease. Examples of recently discovered chromatin-bound long non-coding RNAs important for neuronal health and function include the brain-derived neurotrophic factor antisense transcript (Bdnf-AS) which regulates expression of the corresponding sense transcript, and LOC389023 which is associated with human-specific histone methylation signatures at the chromosome 2q14.1 neurodevelopmental risk locus by regulating expression of DPP10, an auxillary subunit for voltage-gated K(+) channels. We predict that the exploration of chromatin-bound RNA will significantly advance our current knowledge base in neuroepigenetics and biological psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The clinician's dilemma: two dimensions of ethical care.", "Abstract": "There is a continuing intense medico-ethico-legal debate around legalized euthanasia and physician assisted suicide such that ethically informed clinicians often agree with the arguments but feel hesitant about the conclusion, especially when it may bring about a change in law. We argue that this confusion results from the convergence of two continua that underpin the conduct of a clinician and are especially prominent in psychiatry. The two continua concern the duty of care and the importance of patient autonomy and they do not quite map into traditional divides in debates about sanctity of life, paternalism, and autonomy. As ethical dimensions, they come into sharp focus in the psychological complexities of end-of-life care and they form two key factors in most ethical and legal or disciplinary deliberations about a clinician's actions. Whereas both dimensions are important when a clinician reflects on what s/he has done or should do, they need careful balancing in a request for euthanasia or physician assisted suicide where the patient wants to take a decisive role in his or her own end-of-life care. However, end-of-life is also a situation where clinicians often encounter 'cries for help' so that both continua are importantly in play. Balancing these two continua without using blunt legal instruments is often required in psychiatric care in such a way as to problematize the idea that patient decisions should dominate the care options available. A simplistic approach to that issue arguably plays into what has been called an 'impoverished construction of life and death' and, some would say, devalues the basic commitments fundamental to medical care."}, {"Title": "Physician-assisted suicide in psychiatry and loss of hope.", "Abstract": "In the Netherlands, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) are considered acceptable medical practices in specific circumstances. The majority of cases of euthanasia and PAS involve patients suffering from cancer. However, in 1994 the Dutch Supreme Court in the so-called Chabot-case ruled that \"the seriousness of the suffering of the patient does not depend on the cause of the suffering\", thereby rejecting a distinction between physical (or somatic) and mental suffering. This opened the way for further debate about the acceptability of PAS in cases of serious and refractory mental illness. An important objection against offering PAS to mentally ill patients is that this might reinforce loss of hope, and demoralization. Based on an analysis of a reported case, this argument is evaluated. It is argued that offering PAS to a patient with a mental illness who suffers unbearably, enduringly and without prospect of relief does not necessarily imply taking away hope and can be ethically acceptable."}, {"Title": "Suicide following an infestation of bed bugs.", "Abstract": "Male, 62.\nBipolar disorder.\nBordeline personality disorder.\n-\nBed bug infestation.\nPsychiatry.\nUnusual clinical course.\nIn the past decade, bed bug infestations have been increasingly common in high income countries.

Unlike cognitive therapies, it does not involve cognitive functioning and may increase psychotherapies' efficiency.\nIn the absence of data in the scientific literature (Medline and Web of Science), we propose a synthesis of theoretical data from social psychology with a reflection on its applications in the daily practice of psychiatry.\nFirstly we present auto-manipulation: the \"chilling effect\" is the fact that people tend to keep to a decision and to duplicate it, even if it does not work. The commitment of the patient, i.e., the degree to which he/she identifies with his/her act, will be even stronger if the patient's sense of freedom is high. The rationalization process is the ability for individuals to revisit their beliefs after being forced to issue a behavior (that he/she did not adhere to) to justify it a posteriori. In the second part, we present techniques for hetero-manipulation. Priming is to ask about a low effort to \"initiate\" the behavior. The lure technique is to hide convenience or invent fictitious benefits of a product, but is not ethical. The labeling technique is to assign an individual to a positive value regardless of his or her behavior, which increases the probability of emission of positive behaviors. The touch technique, whatever the cultural context, encourages a patient to have more confidence in his/her therapist and to make them friendly towards the person involved by creating a positive mood, reduces stress in patients before surgery, and improve the academic performance of students.\nWe propose reflections on the application of these concepts in daily practice in the psychiatric interview.

However, rTMS protocols need to be optimized. Basic researches in TMS led to the concept of \"state dependency TMS\". This concept suggests that the neural circuits' activation states, before and during the stimulation, influence the pulse effect. Indeed, TMS effect must be seen, not simply as a stimulus, but also as the result of an interaction between a stimulus and a level of brain activity. Those data suggest that rTMS efficiency could be increased in psychiatric disorders by triggering patients' neurocognitive activities during stimulation. Thus \"interactive rTMS protocols\" have been submitted.\nThis article provides a review and a classification of different interactive protocols implemented in the treatment of MDE and schizophrenia. Protocols' interactions with cognitive activities and brain electrical activities will be discussed.\nInteractive rTMS protocols that manipulate cognitive activities have been developed for MDE treatments. They aim at regulating emotional states of depressed patients during the stimulation. The patients perform emotional tasks in order to activate cortical networks involving the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) into a state that may be more sensitive to the rTMS pulse effect. Simultaneous cognitive behavioral therapy (\"CBT rTMS\") and cognitive-emotional reactivation (\"affective rTMS\") have thus been tested during left DLPFC rTMS in MDE. Interactive rTMS protocols that manipulate brain electrical activities have been developed for MDE and schizophrenia treatments. Two categories of protocols should be identified. In the first set, personalized brain activity has been analyzed to determine the parameters of stimulation (i.e. frequency of stimulation) matching the patient (\"personalized rTMS\"). Personalized rTMS protocols can be made \"online\" or \"offline\" depending on whether the EEG activity is measured during or prior to rTMS. Online protocol is called \"contingent rTMS\": it consists in stimulating the brain only when a specific EEG pattern involving the intensity of alpha rhythm is recorded and recognized. Offline protocol is called \"alpha rTMS\", and relies on ascertaining frequency of stimulation in accordance with personalized alpha peak frequency prior to rTMS. In the second set, electrical brain activity is modulated before or during rTMS in order to stimulate the DLPFC in optimal conditions. Brain activity modulation may be obtained by transcranial direct current stimulation (\"tDCS rTMS\") or EEG-biofeedack (\"EEG-biofeedback rTMS\").\nInteractive rTMS studies have various limitations, notably their exploratory character on a small sample of patients. Furthermore, their theoretical neurocognitive framework justification remains unclear. Nonetheless, interactive rTMS protocols allow us to consider a new field of rTMS, where cognitive and cerebral activities would no longer be considered as simple neural noise, leading to a kind of \"first person rTMS\", and certainly to innovative therapy in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Paediatric health-care professionals: relationships between psychological distress, resilience and coping skills.", "Abstract": "To investigate the impact of regular exposure to paediatric medical trauma on multidisciplinary teams in a paediatric hospital and the relationships between psychological distress, resilience and coping skills.\nSymptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, secondary traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, stress, burnout, compassion satisfaction, resilience and coping skills were measured in 54 health professionals and compared with published norms.\nParticipants experienced more symptoms of secondary traumatic stress (P < 0.01), showed less resilience (P = 0.05) and compassion satisfaction (\u2265 0.01), more use of optimism and sharing as coping strategies, and less use of dealing with the problem and non-productive coping strategies than comparative groups.

Candidate gene studies to investigate hypothesized gene-environment interactions are now fairly common in human genetic research, and with the shift toward genome-wide association studies, genome-wide gene-environment interaction studies are beginning to emerge.\nWe summarize the basic ideas behind gene-environment interaction, and provide an overview of possible study designs and traditional analysis methods in the context of genome-wide analysis. We then discuss novel approaches beyond the traditional strategy of analyzing the interaction between the environmental factor and each polymorphism individually.\nTwo-step filtering approaches that reduce the number of polymorphisms tested for interactions can substantially increase the power of genome-wide gene-environment studies. New analytical methods including data-mining approaches, and gene-level and pathway-level analyses, also have the capacity to improve our understanding of how complex genetic and environmental factors interact to influence psychologic and psychiatric traits. Such methods, however, have not yet been utilized much in behavioral and mental health research.\nAlthough methods to investigate gene-environment interactions are available, there is a need for further development and extension of these methods to identify gene-environment interactions in the context of genome-wide association studies.

Nevertheless, they cause complications in the long-term treatment, which is mainly weight gain. In this study, we investigated circulating levels of hypothalamic neuropeptides, which are related to appetite regulation, neuropeptide Y (NPY), \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), and leptin, in first-attack psychotic patients who were treated with an atypical antipsychotic drug, risperidone, for 4 weeks. We used a case-control association design to compare the neuropeptides in the control group versus before and after treatment of the patient group. Samples were obtained from psychotic patients who were admitted to the Psychiatry Outpatient Clinics, Gulhane School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey. When compared with the control group, NPY and \u03b1-MSH plasma levels of psychotic patients were severely reduced, and the CART levels were substantially increased when they were first diagnosed (before treatment). However, the patients' body mass index and circulating leptin levels were markedly high after the treatment. Circulating levels of those neurohormones were not significantly changed between before and after treatment of the patients. These data demonstrate that peripheral \u03b1-MSH and NPY, although reflecting only secretion from peripheral organs, nevertheless, may provide an insight into the patients sympathetic tone and also suggest change of their appetite regulation. \u03b1-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone, NPY, and CART plasma levels may be used as a predictor of weight gain in the early treatment of the patients along with the leptin levels."}, {"Title": "Building a new paradigm for the early recognition of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia: Late Onset Frontal Lobe Syndrome study.", "Abstract": "To describe the aims and design of the ongoing Late Onset Frontal Lobe Syndrome study (LOF study), a study on the spectrum of neurodegenerative and psychiatric etiologies causing behavioral changes in later life, and on the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in predicting and identifying the different underlying pathologies with a special focus on the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia.\nThe LOF study is an observational cross-sectional and prospective follow-up study.

We presented a vignette of a patient with medically unexplained symptoms, and experimentally varied whether the patient was religiously observant. We asked whether physicians would recommend six interventions: antidepressant medication, in-office counseling, referral to a psychiatrist, referral to a psychologist or licensed counselor, participation in meaningful relationships and activities, and involvement in religious community. Predictors included the physician's specialty and the physician's attendance at religious services.\nThe response rate was 63% (896 of 1427) primary care physicians and 64% (312 of 487) psychiatrists. We did not find evidence that religious physicians were less likely to recommend mental health resources, nor did we find evidence that psychiatrists were less likely to recommend religious involvement. Primary care physicians (but not psychiatrists) were more likely to recommend that the patient get more involved in their religious community when the patient was more religiously observant, and when the physician more frequently attended services.\nWe did not find evidence that mental health professionals are biased against religion, nor that religious physicians are biased against mental health professionals.

The objective of this study was to identify international paradigm shifts since 1950 in psychiatric theorising and management models.\nMultiple methods were used, including citation analysis, qualitative judgments by highly cited researchers and obtaining the views of historians of psychiatry.\nThe quantitative citation analysis was of low yield, seemingly reflecting limitations intrinsic to such an approach, but it did identify some 'signals' to broader domain shifts, such as the progressive loss of salience of psychoanalysis and a contrasting emphasis on a science-weighted model. Also, the highly cited researchers tend to nominate narrow exemplars. Nominations by the historians were more panoramic and, while capturing the domains identified by the two other strategies, went further in proposing a wide set of additional candidates for consideration.\nOf the three strategies employed, the qualitative approach (canvassing the views of historians and of highly cited authors) captured the paradigm changes, or at least theoretical or research trends, more accurately than the quantitative citation analysis.

Neuroaesthetics has been established; the discovery of the mirror neuron system and theories about its function have appeared; a growing interest in positive affect and pleasure has developed in psychiatry and medicine. The purpose of the present paper is to reconsider the TIN (Brankovi\u0107 2001) in the context of the advance in neuroscience during the last decade and to show how much conceptual clarity is gained when the recent empirical and theoretical findings are viewed from the standpoint of the TIN. A computational model of the aesthetic response based on the TIN's two-factor model of hedonic value of stimuli is delineated."}, {"Title": "[Neuroethics: ethical issues in neurosciences].", "Abstract": "Neuroethics is a field of bioethics on the ethical challenges of advances in neuroscience.

The results show that SPs are used predominantly for teaching communication and counseling techniques, history taking, and assessment of psychopathology and are commonly used to portray patients with affective disorders, neurotic, stress and somatoform disorders and schizophrenia, as well as schizotypal and delusional disorders. The use of SPs is generally rated positively with regard to subjective learning effects, satisfaction, and authenticity.

Its legal regulations do not only differ between European countries, but also on a federal level. Only few studies so far dealt with rates of involuntary admission (RIA), mainly focusing on adults, rather than children and adolescents. None of the studies analyzed this topic in a large cohort. The aim of this regional cross-sectional study was to compare voluntary and involuntary admissions in child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) regarding personal and admission characteristics. Furthermore, risk factors and predictors of involuntary admission should be identified. A retrospective analysis of hospital admission registers from three major German CAP hospitals over a period of 6 years (2004-2009) was conducted (N = 10,547 inpatients). Group comparisons between involuntarily and voluntarily treated minors and a logistic regression to determine predictors of legal status were performed. Information on harm to self or others prior to the admission, medication and clinical outcome was not available due to data structure. 70.8 % of patients were voluntarily and 29.2 % involuntarily admitted. Both subsamples comprised more males. The RIA decreased consistently over the years, ranging from 25.7 to 32.4 %. The strongest predictor of being admitted involuntarily was suffering from mental retardation (OR = 15.74). Adolescence, substance abuse, psychotic disorders and admission on duty time were also strongly associated (OR > 3). In this first large cohort study on involuntary treatment of children and adolescents in Germany, about every fourth patient was treated involuntarily. Certain personal and disease-related factors increased the risk. Commitment laws and other legal instruments for regulating involuntary placements are inconsistent and a standardized description or systematic analysis is needed. The influence of demographic, institutional variables and care and health services aspects should also be investigated."}, {"Title": "Joint crisis plans and psychiatric advance directives in German psychiatric practice.", "Abstract": "This study explores the attitude of German psychiatrists in leading positions towards joint crisis plans and psychiatric advance directives. This topic was examined by contacting 473 medical directors of German psychiatric hospitals and departments. They were asked to complete a questionnaire developed by us. That form contained questions about the incidence and acceptance of joint crisis plans and psychiatric advance directives and previous experiences with them. 108 medical directors of psychiatric hospitals and departments responded (response rate: 22.8%). Their answers demonstrate that in their hospitals these documents are rarely used. Among the respondents, joint crisis plans are more accepted than psychiatric advance directives. There is a certain uncertainty when dealing with these instruments. Our main conclusion is that German psychiatry needs an intensified discussion on the use of instruments for patients to constitute procedures for future critical psychiatric events. For this purpose it will be helpful to collect more empirical data. Furthermore, the proposal of joint crisis plans in psychiatric hospitals and departments should be discussed as well as the possibility of consulting an expert during the preparation of a psychiatric advance directive."}, {"Title": "Influence of lifelong dietary fats on the brain fatty acids and amphetamine-induced behavioral responses in adult rat.", "Abstract": "The influence of dietary fatty acids (FA) on mania-like behavior and brain oxidative damage were evaluated in rats. First generation of rats born and maintained under supplementation with soybean-oil (SO), fish-oil (FO) or hydrogenated-vegetable-fat (HVF), which are rich in n-6, n-3 and trans (TFA) FA, respectively, until adulthood, were exposed to an amphetamine (AMPH)-induced mania animal model to behavioral and biochemical evaluations. While AMPH caused hyperlocomotion in HVF and, to a less extent, in SO- and FO-groups, a better memory performance was observed in FO group. Among vehicle-groups, HVF increased reactive species (RS) generation and protein-carbonyl (PC) levels in cortex; FO reduced RS generation in hippocampus and decreased PC levels in hippocampus and striatum. Among AMPH-treated animals, HVF exacerbated RS generation in all evaluated brain areas and increased PC levels in cortex and striatum; FO reduced RS generation in hippocampus and decreased PC levels in hippocampus and striatum. FO was related to higher percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in cortex and striatum, while HVF was associated to higher incorporation of TFA in cortex, hippocampus and striatum, besides increased n-6/n-3 FA ratio in striatum. While a continuous exposure to TFA may intensify oxidative events in brain, a prolonged FO consumption may prevent mania-like-behavior; enhance memory besides decreasing brain oxidative markers. A substantial inclusion of processed foods, instead of foods rich in omega-3, in the long term is able to influence the functionality of brain structures related to behavioral disturbances and weaker neuroprotection, whose impact should be considered by food safety authorities and psychiatry experts."}, {"Title": "At the intersection of toxicology, psychiatry, and genetics: a diagnosis of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.", "Abstract": "Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is a genetic disorder involving a mutation of the ornithine transcarbamylase gene, located on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp21.1). This makes the expression of the gene most common in homozygous males, but heterozygous females can also be affected and may be more likely to suffer from serious morbidity. Most males present early in the neonatal period with more devastating outcomes than their female counterparts. Up to 34% will present in the first 30 days of life (J Pediatr 2001;138:S30). Females often have partially functioning mitochondria due to uneven distribution of the mutant gene secondary to lyonization (\u201cX-chromosome Inactivation\u201d. Genetics Home Reference, 2012). Occasionally, symptomatic females may not even present until they are placed under metabolic stress such as a severe illness, fasting, pregnancy, or new medication (Roth KS, Steiner RD. \u201cOrnithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency\u201d. EMedicine, 2012). The urea cycle is the body's primary tool for the disposal of excess nitrogen, which is generated by the routine metabolism of proteins and amino acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction impairs urea production and result in hyperammonemia (Semin Neonatol 2002;7:27). The sine qua non among all degrees of OTC deficiency at presentation is hyperammonemia. As in adults, children will have similar symptoms of encephalopathy, but this may be expressed differently depending on the child's developmental level. We present an unusual case of OTC deficiency in an older child with undifferentiated symptoms of an anticholinergic toxidrome, liver failure, iron overdose, and mushroom poisoning."}, {"Title": "The professional competence profile of Finnish nurses practising in a forensic setting.", "Abstract": "Forensic nurses in Finland work in the two state-maintained forensic hospitals. The main function of these hospitals is to perform forensic psychiatric evaluation and provide treatment for two groups of patients: violent offenders found not guilty by reason of insanity, and those too dangerous or difficult to be treated in regional hospitals. Although the forensic nurses work with the most challenging psychiatric patients, they do not have any preparatory special education for the work. This paper describes the development of nurses who participated in a 1-year further education programme that was tailored to them. The nurses experienced that the 1-year education had a significant impact on their overall competence level. They found that their skills for observing, helping, teaching and caring for their patients had increased during the education. Conversely, it was found that the nurses collaborated little with their patients' family members. They were also not familiar with utilizing research findings in improving their care of patients. Forensic nursing is a global and relatively young profession that combines nursing care and juridical processes. There are, however, significant differences in the qualifications of forensic nurses internationally. The aim of the study was to describe the professional competence profile of practising forensic nurses in Finland and to explore the effects of a 1-year further education programme on that competence profile. The data were collected in 2011-2012 using the Nurse Competence Scale comprising seven competence categories, and analysed using the software package SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc., Armonk, NY, USA). The participants were 19 forensic nurses and their 15 head nurses. The assessed overall scores from both informant groups indicated a high level of competence across the seven categories. The nurses felt that the overall competence level had increased during the education programme. The increase seen by the head nurses was smaller. The less frequent competence items included utilization of research and involvement of family in care. It can be stated that the 1-year further education programme was effective in developing the nurses' competence profile and, in particular, affected their professional self-confidence. It will, however, be essential to strengthen their skills for working with families and their awareness of evidence-based forensic nursing."}, {"Title": "Preventive psychiatry: Concept appraisal and future directions.", "Abstract": "Preventive psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry that aims at health promotion, protection from specific mental illnesses, early diagnosis, effective treatment, disability limitation and rehabilitation.

Here we compared the effects of five drugs (cannabis, psilocybin, amphetamine, ketamine and alcohol) in relation to psychiatric symptoms in a two-part subjective analysis. In the first part, mental health professionals associated statements referring to specific experiences, for example 'I don't bother to get out of bed', to one or more psychiatric symptom clusters, for example depression and negative psychotic symptoms. This measured the specificity of an experience for a particular disorder. In the second part, individuals with personal experience with each of the above-listed drugs were asked how reliably each drug produced the experiences listed in part 1, both acutely and sub-acutely. Part 1 failed to find any experiences that were specific for negative or cognitive psychotic symptoms over depression. The best model of positive symptoms was psilocybin and the best models overall were the acute alcohol and amphetamine models of mania.

Pregabalin decreases the release of neurotransmitters, including glutamate, norepinephrine, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Purpose of this paper is to offer a qualitative overview of the studies currently available in literature about this drug, examining the effectiveness of pregabalin in its various fields of application. Our analysis, conducted on a final selection of 349 scientific papers, shows that pregabalin may help to reduce pain in diabetic neuropathy, in post-herpetic neuralgia and in some patients affected by fibromyalgia. It is also effective for the treatment of diverse types of seizures and has similar efficacy to benzodiazepines and venlafaxine in anxiety disorder. Moreover, pregabalin may be a therapeutic agent for the treatment of alcohol abuse, in both withdrawal phase and relapse prevention. Possible implications in the treatment of benzodiazepines dependence are emerging, but a potential abuse or misuse of the drug has also been reported.

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory was completed before and after the acupuncture treatment (individualized and according to traditional Chinese medicine principles) or the waiting list condition. Both acupuncture groups showed significant lower scores on the sleep inventory, which was not the case for the waiting list condition. Moreover, it was found that the effectiveness of the acupuncture treatment was higher in the patients with schizophrenia than in the patients with depression.

We contacted authors of relevant abstracts in conference proceedings of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and we handsearched the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (1978 to 1999).\nRandomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of orally administered tricyclic drugs with placebo in depressed people aged 6 to 18 years.\nOne of two review authors selected the trials, assessed their quality, and extracted trial and outcome data. A second review author assessed quality and checked accuracy of extracted data. Most studies reported multiple outcome measures including depression scales and clinical global impression scales. For each study, we took the best available depression measure as the index measure of depression outcome. We established predetermined criteria to assist in the ranking of measures. Where study authors reported categorical outcomes, we calculated individual and pooled risk ratios for non-improvement in treated compared with control subjects. For continuous outcomes, we calculated pooled effect sizes as the number of standard deviations by which the change in depression scores for the treatment group exceeded those for the control group.\nFourteen trials (590 participants) were included. No overall difference was found for the primary outcome of response to treatment compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.26; 9 trials, N = 454). There was a small reduction in depression symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.32, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.04; 13 trials, N = 533), but the evidence was of low quality. Subgroup analyses suggested a small reduction in depression symptoms among adolescents (SMD -0.45, 95% CI -0.83 to -0.007), and negligible change among children (SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.64).

Wide CIs and the probability of selective reporting mean that there was very low-quality evidence for adverse events.There was heterogeneity across the studies in the age of participants, treatment setting, tricyclic drug administered and outcome measures. Statistical heterogeneity was identified for reduction in depressive symptoms, but not for rates of remission or response. As such, the findings from analyses of pooled data should be interpreted with caution.We judged none of these trials to be at low risk of bias, with limited information about many aspects of risk of bias, high dropout rates, and issues regarding measurement instruments and the clinical usefulness of outcomes, which were often variously defined across trials.\nData suggest tricyclic drugs are not useful in treating depression in children.

These frameworks enable us to specify targets for further developing and integrating literature-based discovery in multidisciplinary research of general practice, psychology and psychiatry, and epidemiology."}, {"Title": "[Domestic violence against women of a crisis intervention population - forms of violence and risk factors].", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES: Domestic violence is common and can lead to severe physical and psychological problems.

On the basis of the case of a 73-year-old man with therapy-resistant major depressive episode who experienced anticholinergic delirium after adding VPA to AMI, we retrospectively analyzed therapeutic drug monitoring data of the years 2008 to 2010. We assessed cases receiving a combination of AMI and VPA, and obtained a control sample of AMI patients without VPA which were matched for sex, age, daily dose, and comedication. Both samples were compared regarding the serum levels of AMI and nortriptyline (NOR) as well as the ratio of NOR and AMI with the Mann-Whitney U test. The combination of AMI and VPA led to a remarkable increase of AMI and NOR serum levels. When comparing 33 patients who received comedication with VPA versus 33 matched controls, the total concentration by combining mean AMI and NOR serum levels (237.1 [119.9] vs 126.4 [52.8] ng/mL) and NOR/AMI ratio (1.300 [0.905] vs 0.865 [0.455]) was significantly higher. Both AMI and VPA are widely prescribed drugs. A combination of both is common for psychiatric or neurologic patients. A cautious dosing of AMI with VPA comedication is advisable, and therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed because this combination may lead to a remarkable increase of AMI and NOR serum levels."}, {"Title": "The autism brain imaging data exchange: towards a large-scale evaluation of the intrinsic brain architecture in autism.", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a formidable challenge for psychiatry and neuroscience because of their high prevalence, lifelong nature, complexity and substantial heterogeneity. Facing these obstacles requires large-scale multidisciplinary efforts. Although the field of genetics has pioneered data sharing for these reasons, neuroimaging had not kept pace. In response, we introduce the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)-a grassroots consortium aggregating and openly sharing 1112 existing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data sets with corresponding structural MRI and phenotypic information from 539 individuals with ASDs and 573 age-matched typical controls (TCs; 7-64 years) (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/). Here, we present this resource and demonstrate its suitability for advancing knowledge of ASD neurobiology based on analyses of 360 male subjects with ASDs and 403 male age-matched TCs. We focused on whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity and also survey a range of voxel-wise measures of intrinsic functional brain architecture. Whole-brain analyses reconciled seemingly disparate themes of both hypo- and hyperconnectivity in the ASD literature; both were detected, although hypoconnectivity dominated, particularly for corticocortical and interhemispheric functional connectivity. Exploratory analyses using an array of regional metrics of intrinsic brain function converged on common loci of dysfunction in ASDs (mid- and posterior insula and posterior cingulate cortex), and highlighted less commonly explored regions such as the thalamus. The survey of the ABIDE R-fMRI data sets provides unprecedented demonstrations of both replication and novel discovery. By pooling multiple international data sets, ABIDE is expected to accelerate the pace of discovery setting the stage for the next generation of ASD studies."}, {"Title": "Understanding psychiatric institutionalization: a conceptual review.", "Abstract": "Since Goffman's seminal work on psychiatric institutions, deinstitutionalization has become a leading term in the psychiatric debate. It described the process of closure or downsizing of large psychiatric hospitals and the establishment of alternative services in the community. Yet, there is a lack of clarity on what exactly the concept of institutionalization means in present-day psychiatry. This review aims to identify the meaning of psychiatric institutionalization since the early 1960s to present-day.\nA conceptual review of institutionalization in psychiatry was conducted. Thematic analysis was used to synthesize the findings.\nFour main themes were identified in conceptualizing institutionalization: bricks and mortar of care institutions; policy and legal frameworks regulating care; clinical responsibility and paternalism in clinician-patient relationships; and patients' adaptive behavior to institutionalized care.\nThe concept of institutionalization in psychiatry reflects four distinct themes. All themes have some relevance for the contemporary debate on how psychiatric care should develop and on the role of institutional care in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Usefulness of 2 questions about age and year of birth in the case-finding of dementia.", "Abstract": "To test the hypothesis that the efficacy of 2 simple questions commonly used in clinical practice, asking the age and year of birth of individuals, will be satisfactory to rule out cases of dementia.\nPopulation-based, longitudinal, prospective study focused on the incidence of dementia.

To accomplish this, the placebo is explored at the centre of an often heated debate between three discrete perspectives: the clinical trial researcher, the placebo researcher and the clinician. Each occupational perspective has its own vested interests and practical concerns that drive how the placebo concepts are negotiated and applied. It is argued that because the trial and placebo researchers typically represent opposing viewpoints, clinicians are generally uncomfortable or even baffled by placebo concepts, and this three-way tension has crucial implications for the field's progress."}, {"Title": "Salem witchcraft and lessons for contemporary forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In 1692 and 1693, in Salem, Massachusetts, more than 150 colonists were accused of witchcraft, resulting in 19 being hanged and one man being crushed to death.

Child witnessing, certainty of physician diagnosis, use of special evidence in the absence of scholarly and legal scrutiny, and tautological reasoning were important factors, as well. For forensic psychiatry, the events at Salem in 1692 still hold contemporary implications.

Severe psychiatric side effects due to mefloquine intoxication are well documented, including anxiety, panic attacks, paranoia, persecutory delusions, dissociative psychosis, and anterograde amnesia. Exposure to the drug has been associated with acts of violence and suicide. In this article, we discuss the history of mefloquine use and describe plausible mechanisms of its psychotropic action. Mefloquine intoxication has not yet been successfully advanced in legal proceedings as a defense or as a mitigating factor, but it appears likely that it eventually will be.

The study sample included only Qatari and other Arab nationals.\nThe study was based on a face to face interview with a designed Patient Doctor Relationship Questionnaire (PDRQ). A standard forward-backward procedure was applied to translate the English version of the PDRQ to Arabic. The main outcome measures of the study were 13-item patient doctor relationship questionnaire (PDRQ) score and other 11 items assessing what patients need from psychiatrists. Also, Socio-demographic data of the patients were collected. PDRQ was administered by qualified nurses among the psychiatry patients.\nOf the studied patients, 50.9% were males and 49.1% were females. Male patients (55.5%) were more satisfied with the treatment of psychiatrists than females (44.5%). A significant association was observed between male and female patients in terms of marital status (P = 0.02), number of children (P < 0.001), education level (P = 0.001) and monthly household income (P = 0.03).

This report describes their views on methods of assessing professionalism.\nResidents strongly agreed that clinical supervision is an appropriate assessment method. Moreover, they rated clinical supervision more highly than oral examinations, short-answer questions, essays, and standardized patient interactions. Residents also strongly favored direct faculty observation of residents' interactions with actual patients and clinical team members.\nThis study suggests that both direct faculty supervision and other clinically-based assessments are methods accepted by psychiatry residents.

Because of the distinct lack of high-evidence-level research conducted in this area, no definitive clinical guidelines are available on its treatment. The aim of this article was to summarize the current literature on the pharmacological treatment of delusional disorder in the form of a review, as well as to analyze a series of 6 cases treated at the Department of Psychiatry at \"Charit\u00e9-University Medicine Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin\" between 2005 and 2011; in each case paying special attention to the relative efficacy and acceptability of the antipsychotics used.\nA MEDLINE search was conducted to capture all articles on the treatment of delusional disorder published since 2004. After viewing titles and abstracts, these articles were then assessed for relevance.\nThe files of 6 cases of delusional disorder treated at the previously mentioned clinic were analyzed and information regarding the type of medication, dose, and duration of treatment as well as adverse effects was extracted and summarized. In line with previous studies, it was found that delusional disorder has a moderate prognosis when adequately treated and that noncompliance is often the reason for poor treatment results. Various novel antipsychotics as well as a combination of medication treatment and psychotherapy produced positive results. Generally, adverse effects were easily managed by a reduction in dose or a switch to another antipsychotic, and it was often necessary to try out a number of antipsychotics before arriving at a satisfactory solution."}, {"Title": "At the boundary of the self: the insular cortex in patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia, their healthy siblings, and normal volunteers.", "Abstract": "The insular cortex (insula), whose normal function involves delineating the boundary between self and non-self stimuli, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, including hallucinations and delusions. Childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS), that includes the onset of psychosis before age 13, is a severe and continuous form of the illness which shows profound and global progressive cortical brain abnormalities during adolescence which merge in the adult pattern with age. Using prospectively acquired anatomic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, a matched sample of COS patients, their nonpsychotic full siblings and healthy volunteers, we measured insular volume using the FreeSurfer automated software. COS patients (n=98; 234 scans) had significantly lower right (p=0.003), left (p<0.001), and total (p<0.001) insular volumes than healthy volunteers (n=100; 248 scans). Right insular volume negatively correlated with positive symptoms as measured by the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) (p=0.02), while both left (p=0.01) and right (p=0.006) insula volumes were positively correlated with overall functioning, as measured by the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) scores. COS siblings (n=71; 153 scans), on the other hand, did not differ significantly from normal volunteers suggesting that the insular deficits are more related to the illness state than a familial endophenotype. These results also highlight the salience of the insula in positive symptoms of schizophrenia perhaps resulting from the inability to discriminate between self from the non-self in COS. Further work to connect insular deficits to other neurocircuitries is warranted."}, {"Title": "Patterns of benzodiazepine and antidepressant use among middle-aged adults. the Brazilian longitudinal study of adult health (ELSA-Brasil).", "Abstract": "Antidepressant and benzodiazepine medicines are widely prescribed in high-income countries. Our aim was to investigate and describe clinical and demographic characteristics of their use in a large cohort from a middle-income country.\nParticipants (n=15,105) from the Brazilian Health Longitudinal Study (ELSA-Brasil), a civil servant cohort from six different sites in Brazil were asked about antidepressant and benzodiazepine use. The Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised was used for psychiatric assessment. Sociodemographic and clinical data were also collected.\nCurrent use of antidepressant and benzodiazepine medicines was respectively reported by 6.87% and 3.88% of participants. These numbers were higher in major depression-MDD (16.5% and 13.9%), generalized anxiety disorder-GAD (14% and 9.5%) and any mental disorder (11.7% and 7.8%). The use of antidepressant and benzodiazepine was directly associated with clinical comorbidities and psychiatry diagnosis. In addition, older age was associated with benzodiazepine use and more years of schooling, with antidepressant use. Finally, the use of these medicines was strongly associated (odds ratio=8.48, p<0.001).\nOur cohort does not include younger adults (18-34 years), although it includes older (65-75 years) participants.\nAntidepressant and benzodiazepine use in Brazil is lower than in high-income countries.

The item reduction process required semi-structured interviews of psychiatric outpatients (n=30). The final version of the PASAP is a 9-item, 5-point Likert-type scale, covering the scope of effectiveness and adherence. To assess the psychometric properties of the scale, French patients with an acute manic episode (n=314) from a large European observational cohort completed the PASAP scale 3 months after psychotropic treatment initiation/change. Internal validity and reliability were assessed using principal component analysis (PCA). Concurrent validity was assessed using comparisons to physician-rated satisfaction with life, illness severity, mood relapse, compliance and side effects.\nParticipation rate was 68.4%. PCA was in favour of uni-dimensionality. Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient was 0.85 (95%CI 0.83-0.88). All five concurrent measures were significantly associated with the PASAP score.\nThe PASAP scale showed good psychometric properties in a large bipolar population and thus seems adequate for evaluating treatment satisfaction.

Both antenatal and postnatal environmental factors have been considered as potential modulators of genetic activity. Antenatally, especially smoking or alcohol drinking habits of the mother dramatically influence the health of the child during pregnancy and even later on in life. In the present study we would like to introduce a more \"distant\" factor that is not under the control of the becoming mother but that nevertheless plays a potential role for the health of the unborn child later on in adulthood. Here, we retrospectively investigate the influence of solar activity (while the child is still in the uterus of the becoming mother) on brain structure (with a focus on hippocampus and amygdala volume) and personality in adulthood. We observe an interaction of a genetic variant (rs41423247) of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) and solar activity in the first trimester after conception on both hippocampal volume and the personality trait neuroticism in adulthood in N = 254 participants. The NR3C1 gene is the focus of interest, because of its influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and negative emotionality. Carriers of the CC variant of rs41423247 grown in the womb under the influence of high sun radiation (high solar activity) show both the highest hippocampal volume in the left hemisphere and lowest neuroticism scores.

Different methods of analyzing the electroencephalogram (EEG) changes during ECT have been studied for predicting clinical outcome. Analysis of the fractal dimension (FD) is one such method. Mid-seizure and post-seizure FD has been shown to correlate with antidepressant effect. In this study, we examined whether the highest fractal dimension achieved during each ECT session changed over the course of 6 ECTs. The sample for this study came from a randomized controlled trial, comparing the efficacy of bifrontal and bitemporal electrode placements in schizophrenia. EEG was recorded using bilateral frontal pole leads during all ECT sessions. In 40 of the 114 randomized patients, we could obtain artifact-free EEGs for the first 6 ECT sessions. FD was calculated using standardized algorithms. For each session, the average of 5 highest FDs was calculated. The change in this value over a course of 6 ECTs was analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. The average highest FD remained virtually unchanged across the 6 ECT sessions. Means (standard deviations) average maximum FDs over the 6 sessions were 1.57 (0.075), 1.57 (0.064), 1.56 (0.064), 1.57 (0.062), 1.55 (0.07), and 1.56 (0.067); occasion effect, F = 0.5, P = .75.

Recent scientific data suggests a change in our classifications of mental disorders. Depression is frequently used to refer to \"normal\" sadness, anxiety disorders, personality disorders or adjustment disorders... Moreover, in our society, this diagnosis remains badly accepted. It is really time to be aware of the deterioration of the image of psychiatry, and particularly the bad image of depression and its treatment with antidepressants. This paper is a reflexion inviting general practicioners and psychiatrists to progressively avoid the term depression and rather use the diagnosis of unipolar mood disorder, a broader concept, more adapted to new scientific data, less stigmatizing, and closer to the evolution of our society."}, {"Title": "The first president's pathway into ESTSS: memories and ideas for future issue.

However, the heterogeneity of the visual disorders make it a challenge to understand both the mechanisms and the consequences of these impairments, i.e., the way patients experience the outer world. Based on earlier psychiatry literature, we argue that issues regarding time might shed a new light on the disorders observed in patients with schizophrenia. We will briefly review the mechanisms involved in the sense of time continuity and clinical evidence that they are impaired in patients with schizophrenia. We will then summarize a recent experimental approach regarding the coding of time-event structure in time, namely the ability to discriminate between simultaneous and asynchronous events. The use of an original method of analysis allowed us to distinguish between explicit and implicit judgments of synchrony. We showed that for SOAs below 20\u2009ms neither patients nor controls fuse events in time. On the contrary subjects distinguish events at an implicit level even when judging them as synchronous. In addition, the implicit responses of patients and controls differ qualitatively. It is as if controls always put more weight on the last occurred event, whereas patients have a difficulty to follow events in time at an implicit level. In patients, there is a clear dissociation between results at short and large asynchronies, that suggest selective mechanisms for the implicit coding of time-event structure. These results might explain the disruption of the sense of time continuity in patients. We argue that this line of research might also help us to better understand the mechanisms of the visual impairments in patients and how they see their environment."}, {"Title": "[Interdisciplinarity and psychiatry: is it time not to know?].", "Abstract": "This article deals with interdisciplinarity as well as psychiatric and psychosocial care. Throughout the text, a historical account of the constitution and the crisis of scientific knowledge is presented and organized into disciplines. The theoretical difficulty of conceptualizing interdisciplinarity is analyzed and, in the concluding remarks, psychiatry and its relationship to psychosocial care is discussed. The argument is that, because of its history, psychiatry has singularities that differentiate it from other medical specialties and these singularities could initially cause psychiatry to go in the opposite direction in relation to interdisciplinarity. The conclusion is that because of their inherent characteristics psychosocial care services are privileged places for psychiatric training with interdisciplinary characteristics."}, {"Title": "Cross-sectional validation of the Rasch-based Depression Screening (DESC) in a mixed sample of patients with mental and somatic diseases.", "Abstract": "The study aimed to cross-validate the psychometric properties of the two parallel versions of the \"Rasch-based Depression Screening (DESC)\" in a mixed clinical sample of patients with mental disorders and somatic diseases. Additionally, it was intended to confirm the initially proposed cut-off scores.\nOne hundred eleven inpatients from the Departments of Psychiatry (n=50), Cardiology (n=39) and Otorhinolaryngology (n=22) were examined. Accordance to Rasch model assumptions was determined by analyzing item infit and outfit as well as unidimensionality and local independence via residual principal components factor analysis (PCFA). Furthermore, separation, reliability and the targeting were considered. Differential item functioning (DIF) was investigated with regard to gender, age and clinical group. Finally, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves analyses were conducted and parallel test reliability was calculated.\nItem and person separation and reliability were good with separation values being above 2.90 and reliability exceeding being .90. Rasch model fit was good for all items except for the two items \"sad\" and \"hopeless\" displaying slight misfit. Targeting was appropriate with a person mean of -1.6 (DESC-I) and -1.5 (DESC-II) reflecting as expected that the two DESC versions were in average to easy for a mixed sample of patients with mental disorders and somatic. PCFA showed unidimensionality and local independence: The Rasch dimension \"depression\" explained 84.8% (DESC-I) and 82.2% (DESC-II) of the observed variance. No DIF was found. ROC curves confirmed the proposed cut-off score of 12 points. The area under the curve amounted to .91 for both DESC forms. The Youden index was 75.5 for DESC-I and 75.7 for DESC-II. A high parallel test reliability of .94 showed virtual equivalence of both DESC forms.\nResults of the present study support the good psychometric properties of both DESC forms in patients with mental disorders and somatic diseases. This study confirmed the cut-off scores that had already been determined in former patient samples. Thus, both DESC forms can be used validly as screening instruments for depression in clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Prevalence, risk factors and recognition rates of depressive disorders among inpatients of tertiary general hospitals in Shanghai, China.", "Abstract": "To investigate the prevalence, risk factors and recognition rates of depressive disorders among inpatients of tertiary general hospitals in Shanghai, China.\nA total of 784 inpatients were randomly selected from three tertiary general hospitals and evaluated with a Chinese version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0 by ten trained psychiatrists.

This paper argues that such paradigms are poorly suited for fostering principled responses to human suffering, and proposes an alternative approach that considers a view of relationships based in feminist theories about the nature of caring. Four primary characteristics are presented which distinguish caring from technological paradigms: (1) a concern with the particular nature of contexts, (2) embodied practice, (3) the dialogical basis of caring and (4) the existential basis of caring. From this we explore the role of the moral imagination and our ability, through narrative, to acknowledge, engage with and bear witness to the injustices that shape the lives of those who suffer. This, we argue, is at the heart of caring. Clinical implications are discussed, including an exposition of the importance of narrative in recovery from trauma and distress. Narrative Psychiatry, The Sanctuary Model of care, and Soteria, are outlined as examples of this type of practice."}, {"Title": "[Use of restraint in psychiatry: Feelings of caregivers and ethical perspectives].", "Abstract": "The return of restraint in psychiatry raises many ethical issues for caregivers. However their experience is little explored in literature.\nOur objective was to study the feelings of caregivers facing restraint with regard to an ethical perspective and to identify areas for improvement.\nBetween November 2011 and February 2012 a descriptive cross-sectional epidemiological study was performed in two psychiatric emergency services and two closed units in which doctors and nurses were individually interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. Five topics were explored: indications and contexts, impact on the patient, caregiver-patient relationship, perspective on the practice and feelings of caregivers on which we insist particularly. Results were presented in tables with percentages and possibly diagrams. The notable responses of caregivers were also cited.\nTwenty nurses and nine psychiatrists, mostly female, were recruited. They all had participated in experiments of restraint. The self-aggressiveness, the aggressiveness against other persons and agitation were the most frequent indications. In the patients, caregivers identified misunderstanding (79.3%) and anger (75.9%). The majority of nurses (75%) felt that there was an improvement in the caregiver-patient relationship after the episode of restraint compared to what it had been in the moments preceding this measure. The emotional experience of caregivers was rich, intense and predominantly negative type of frustration (35% of nurses; 66.7% of doctors), anger (30 and 33.3%) and lack of feeling (35 and 44.4%). The feelings of doctors and nurses were not completely similar. For caregivers it was \"a difficult but necessary experience\" (82.75%), \"an act of care and safety\" (68.9%). All psychiatrists and almost half of the nurses (45%) said they did not feel the same when they used seclusion. In their opinion, seclusion entailed a less painful experience because of its therapeutic properties. More than half of the caregivers thought that there were alternatives to restraint: the strengthening of containing function in the hours before the use of restraint; the use of seclusion at the time of the decision to restrain. They identified contexts (80%) encouraging the use of restraints, not only related to the patient, the lack of resources but also institutional contexts, in particular conflicts or divisions in the health care team.\nThe misunderstanding of the patient led us to wonder about the quality of the information he/she received: it was sometimes too formal and did not take into account the uniqueness of the patient. The frustration of caregivers could concern the lack of resources but also be directed towards a patient or caregiver. In addition, there were often cleavages between doctors and nurses that stemmed from a misunderstanding, also with rivalries and power struggles. From the literature and caregivers' reflections we identified three prospects to reduce the use of restraint and modify feelings of caregivers: 1) develop better crisis management upstream through increasing resources and improving training; 2) promote patients support in using ethical principles of autonomy and beneficence by showing them solicitude, inviting them to tell themselves and helping them to regain their own experience; 3) develop an afterthought in setting up institutional reflection time by restoring a central role in clinical team meetings in psychiatry, possibly supplemented by supervision, but also through regional ethical spaces.\nIn our investigation, we found that caregivers had a predominantly negative experience with frustration, anger and a lack of feeling. Among caregivers we also identified awareness of ethical issues that may be for the first time for a change."}, {"Title": "Expanding our understanding of sovereign power: on the creation of zones of exception in forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to engage with the readers in a theoretical reflection on nursing practices in forensic psychiatric settings. In this paper, we argue that practices of exclusion in forensic psychiatric settings share some common ground with Agamben's description of sovereign power and, consequently, the possible creation of zones of exception in this environment. The concept of exception is, therefore, purposely used to shift our thinking, highlight the political forces surrounding exclusionary practices in forensic psychiatric nursing, and explore the ethical tensions that arise for nurses who become entangled in the control of these zones of exception.

Expert psychiatrists also gave fewer differential options. Analyzing the think-aloud protocols, expert psychiatrists were much more organized, made fewer mistakes, and utilized significantly less time to access their knowledge than clinical clerks. Both novices and experts seemed to use the hypothetic-deductive and scheme-inductive approaches to diagnosis. However, experts utilized hypothetic-deductive approaches significantly more often than novices.\nThe hypothetic-deductive diagnostic strategy was utilized more than the scheme-inductive approach by both expert psychiatrists and clinical clerks.

This article demonstrates that contemporary literature on 'self-harm' produces this phenomenon (to varying extents) around two key characteristics. First, this behaviour is predominantly performed by those identified as female. Second, this behaviour primarily involves cutting the skin. These constitutive characteristics are traced back to a corpus of literature produced in the 1960s and 1970s in North American psychiatric inpatient institutions; analysis shows how pre-1960 works were substantially different.

Recent studies have reported the existence of a selective set of highly central and interconnected hub regions that may play a crucial role in the brain's integrative processes, together forming a central backbone for global brain communication. Abnormal brain connectivity may have a key role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.\nTo examine the structure of the rich club in schizophrenia and its role in global functional brain dynamics.\nStructural diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were performed in patients with schizophrenia and matched healthy controls.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Rudolf Magnus Institute of Neuroscience, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands.\nForty-eight patients and 45 healthy controls participated in the study. An independent replication data set of 41 patients and 51 healthy controls was included to replicate and validate significant findings. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURES: Measures of rich club organization, connectivity density of rich club connections and connections linking peripheral regions to brain hubs, measures of global brain network efficiency, and measures of coupling between brain structure and functional dynamics.\nRich club organization between high-degree hub nodes was significantly affected in patients, together with a reduced density of rich club connections predominantly comprising the white matter pathways that link the midline frontal, parietal, and insular hub regions. This reduction in rich club density was found to be associated with lower levels of global communication capacity, a relationship that was absent for other white matter pathways. In addition, patients had an increase in the strength of structural connectivity-functional connectivity coupling.\nOur findings provide novel biological evidence that schizophrenia is characterized by a selective disruption of brain connectivity among central hub regions of the brain, potentially leading to reduced communication capacity and altered functional brain dynamics."}, {"Title": "Attitude towards psychiatric treatment and referral pattern in the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital - a preliminary report.", "Abstract": "There is a paucity of literature on consultation-liaison psychiatry, in northern Nigeria.

At the end of the nineteenth century we can observe a process of scientific categorization of phenomena considered to have originated in superstition or popular imagination. In this work we show how trances and spiritual possession were studied by Franz Anton Mesmer and his followers when developing the concept of magnetism; by James Braid during the creation of his theory of hypnosis; and by Jean Martin Charcot, which marked the entry of hysteria into nosological classification.

The aim of this paper is to describe the phenomenology of mental disorders in migrants referred to the Transcultural Psychiatric Team of Bologna (BoTPT), by analysing the psychopathological dimensions that underlie their clinical diagnoses.\nWe recruited all migrants who attended the BoTPT between May 1999 and July 2009. The psychopathological assessment was conducted with the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry (AMDP) and clinical diagnoses were formulated according to ICD-10. We proceeded through a two-step analysis: (1) comparing the prevalence rates of psychopathological symptoms across diagnoses; then (2) conducting a factor analysis to assess how those symptoms configure psychopathological dimensions and how these dimensions underlie clinical diagnoses.\nAs expected, we found significant associations between diagnoses and the prevalence of their core psychopathological symptoms. Factor analysis revealed a strong polymorphism of the psychopathological presentation of mental disorders and unexpectedly showed that in each diagnostic cluster, the first extracted factor was not composed of core symptoms.\nA mixed categorical-dimensional approach seems to improve the description of the psychopathology among migrants, as it adds relevant information regarding psychopathological dimensions useful to the understanding of the peculiar clinical expressivity of our patients."}, {"Title": "[The collective modes of ordering of the voice-hearing experience].", "Abstract": "The article examines how voice-hearing as an (in)direct experience can become a subject of ethnographic observation.\nAn ethnographic participant observation was conducted over a five-month period of time in two \"Trialogue\" self-help groups organized by the \"Netzwerk Stimmenh\u00f6ren\", an NGO based in Berlin, Germany.

Psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and depressive disorder have a negative impact on women's lives. This study has compared the relationship between these mental illnesses and the liabilities of women's lives.\nFor the purpose of this study, 61 schizophrenics, 35 bipolar and 40 unipolar female patients and 60 healthy controls from a university hospital of eastern Turkey were evaluated with SCID- I, a family environmental scale and a personal information questionnaire.\nThe women with psychiatric disorders had higher rates of unemployment, shorter durations of marriage and lower numbers of parity, as compared to their healthy counterparts, especially after the onset of their illnesses. The schizophrenia and bipolar groups are at risk due to the psychotropic medications which they take during pregnancy. The onset or the exacerbations of illnesses during the postpartum period are also seen more in the schizophrenia and the bipolar groups. However, the patients did not use medicines more than the healthy controls during lactation. The schizophrenia and bipolar groups seem to be failing in using reliable methods of contraception. This data is important due to the traditional and the socio-economical structure of eastern Turkey, which may interrelate with the results.\nWomen have to play various roles in life and they have various challenges which are related to these roles.

The aim of this study is to examine patients' preferences for drug testing methods and to compare the acceptability of urine testing versus oral fluid testing (OFT) within a secure hospital setting.\nPatients in three continuing care wards at the State Hospital, Carstairs were offered the choice of either urine or oral fluid testing. We developed protocols and recording forms and trained staff in the administration of the OFT. We recorded the sampling time for OFT and urine, and the views of patients and staff on the testing procedures over a six month period.\nSixty-two samples were taken, with 53 (85%) opting for OFT and nine (15%) opting for urine sampling. The average time taken for OFT was 13 minutes, while the average time taken for urine sampling was 33 minutes. The majority of patients and staff rated oral fluid and urine testing as comfortable and easy. Patients recorded comments on 46 (87%) of OFT samples, only two of which were negative. In general they preferred the OFT because it was quicker and easier and they commented on it being more dignified and private. Patients recorded comments on five (55%) of urine samples, with one of the primary reasons for opting for urine sampling appearing to be a reluctance to try new things, though a few said they did not want to have anything in their mouths. Staff returned comments on 24 (45%) of OFT samples and one (11%) of urine samples. Comments on the OFT were overwhelmingly positive and pointed out the relative speed and ease of this sampling method.\nWe concluded that the pilot study was successful. OFT was found to be generally preferred by patients and staff. Although there was an additional financial cost, this was considered to be outweighed by the significant benefits arising from offering patients choice, the preservation of patient dignity and staff time savings. The option of OFT has now been extended to all patients within the State Hospital.

The aim of this study was to identify the nature of possible impairments in the control of posture by modulation of visual and kinesthetic information during quiet standing. Center of pressure (CoP) data and whole-body kinematics of the center of mass (CoM) were recorded during quite standing on a firm surface with eyes open and with eyes closed, and standing with eyes open on a yielding surface. During all three conditions, patients displayed greater migration of CoM and CoP-CoM, a measure related to ankle joint torque, whereas CoP-frequency (MPF) was similar in patients and healthy subjects. Our results suggested that greater postural sway in patients may depend on disproportionally large ankle joint torque without corresponding increase in frequency.

Despite attempts in the UK to accelerate the process of clinical trials in recent years, there was a significant increase in the extension time for trials to be completed (p\u00a0=\u00a00.038) and the percentage of planned recruitment to mental health studies (71%) was significantly less than for cancer (90.3%) and other studies (86.1%) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.032). Summary. These results suggest that, despite the priority afforded to the advancement of RCTs in healthcare, such studies are encountering increasing difficulty in recruiting to time and target. We suggest that this difficulty can be attributed, at least in part, to the excessively byzantine regulation and governance processes for health research in the UK, and unnecessary bureaucracy in the current National Health Service system. Mental health studies appear particularly vulnerable to delay and better systems to facilitate recruitment are required urgently for the evidence base to be improved and facilitate new cost-effective interventions."}, {"Title": "Malingering and PTSD: detecting malingering and war related PTSD by Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test (M-FAST).", "Abstract": "Malingering is prevalent in PTSD, especially in delayed-onset PTSD. Despite the attempts to detect it, indicators, tools and methods to accurately detect malingering need extensive scientific and clinical research. Therefore, this study was designed to validate a tool that can detect malingering of war-related PTSD by Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test (M-FAST).\nIn this blind clinical diagnosis study, one hundred and twenty veterans referred to War Related PTSD Diagnosis Committee in Iran in 2011 were enrolled. In the first step, the clients received Psychiatry diagnosis and were divided into two groups based on the DSM-IV-TR, and in the second step, the participants completed M-FAST.\nThe t-test score within two groups by M-FAST Scale showed a significant difference (t\u2009=\u200914.058, P\u2009<\u20090.0001), and 92% of malingering war-related PTSD participants scored more than 6 and %87 of PTSD group scored less than 6 in M-FAST Scale.\nM-FAST showed a significant difference between war-related PTSD and malingering participants. The \u22656 score cutoff was suggested by M-FAST to detect malingering of war-related PTSD."}, {"Title": "The moral economy of contemporary working-class adolescence: managing symbolic capital in a French public 'Adolescent Centre'.", "Abstract": "Working-class adolescents of French urban peripheries are key figures in a new social debate that reactivates the nineteenth century spectre of 'dangerous' classes to be controlled. Since the 1990s, French social counselling has privileged two modalities of response: taking account of suffering and government by listening and speech. We hypothesize that the contemporary moral economy allows for social interactions that go beyond social control and institutional domination. This is partly because professionals engaged in this moral undertaking may keep a critical distance, and partly because the concerned populations aren't necessarily devoid of resources to advance their interests or incapable of resistance. The concept of moral economy, coupled with the ethnographic method, is heuristic for fully comprehending the complexity of these issues and their stakes. Our fieldwork was centred on a French Adolescent Centre in an impoverished commune in Paris's periphery, from January 2010 through March 2011. These institutions were established in the early 2000s to respond to adolescent 'suffering' by crossing social work and psychiatry. Adolescents, parents, and other institutions (especially schools) solicit the professionally diverse staff for assistance, which in turn may take on cases and/or make referrals to other support institutions. By paying attention to all the scenes upon which the story of a counselled adolescent evolves, and bearing more general social evolutions in mind by applying the concept of moral economy, we can consider the multiplicity of seemingly contradictory processes as a whole. We see the destabilization of parents and their loss of symbolic capital, partly due to the norms of contemporary parenthood and partly due to the stigmatization of working-class adolescence. But we also discern possibilities for expressing sentiments of injustice and humiliation, for increasing symbolic capital, and in some cases a reappropriation of the system, particularly in trajectories marked by a will for social ascension."}, {"Title": "Does a latent class underlie schizotypal personality disorder? Implications for schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Despite growing enthusiasm for dimensional models of personality pathology, the taxonic versus dimensional status of schizotypal personality disorder (PD) remains a point of contention in modern psychiatry. The current study aimed to determine empirically the latent structure of schizotypal PD. We examined the latent structure of schizotypal PD in the Psychiatric Morbidity Survey in Great Britain and the second wave of the U.S.-based National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) survey. We analyzed composite indicators created from participant responses using the mean above minus mean below a cut (MAMBAC), Maximum Covariance (MAXCOV), and latent mode factor analysis (L-Mode) taxometric procedures. We also analyzed item-level responses using two latent variable mixture models--latent class analysis and latent class factor analysis. Taxometric and latent variable mixture analyses supported a dimensional, rather than taxonic, structure in both epidemiological samples. The dimensional model better predicted psychosis, intellectual functioning, disability, and treatment seeking than the categorical model based on DSM-IV diagnosis. People meeting criteria for schizotypal PD appear to exist on a spectrum of severity with the rest of the population. The possible dimensionality of schizotypal PD adds to growing support for a dimensional structure of PDs including other Cluster A disorders."}, {"Title": "Information-seeking behavior and computer literacy among resident doctors in Maiduguri, Nigeria.", "Abstract": "Resident doctors are key actors in patient management in all the federal training institutions in nigeria.

Recent evidence indicates that the majority of depressed patients will not fully recover with an initial antidepressant treatment. This paper reviews commonly used options for treatment after an inadequate initial antidepressant response. The alternatives range widely, and include escalating the dose of the initial antidepressant, switching to an alternative medication, combining two antidepressants with different mechanisms of action (e.g., bupropion + SSRI or mirtazapine + venlafaxine), adding other medications such as lithium or certain atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, aripiprazole, or quetiapine) to the antidepressant, adding a natural product such as l-methylfolate or s-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), or adding cognitive behavioral psychotherapy.

The objective of this study was to compare the relation of insight in patients with psychotic illness to that of psychopathology and frontal lobe function.\nForty patients with psychotic disorder were selected from those attending the Department of Psychiatry in a tertiary care teaching hospital. The evaluation of insight was carried out using the Schedule for Assessment of Insight (SAI), that of frontal lobe function by the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and psychopathology by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). The correlation coefficients were determined.\nA negative correlation between SAI and BPRS scores means that the BPRS score is opposite to SAI scores. When the SAI total score was compared with the FAB total score, the correlation coefficient demonstrated a positive correlation. Better insight predicted lesser psychopathology and also that poor insight would exist with greater psychopathology. Better insight predicted a higher functional status of frontal lobes and prefrontal cortex in particular.\nInsight deficits in schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses are multidimensional. Integration of different aetiological factors like biological, psychopathological, environmental ones and others are necessary for a better understanding of insight in psychosis."}, {"Title": "Self-directedness and cooperativeness, psychosocial dysfunction and suffering in ESSENCE.", "Abstract": "The acronym ESSENCE (Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examinations) highlights that children seeking clinical treatment are often multiply impaired, thus requiring treatment from several specialties.

The A-TAC was first used to discern four ESSENCE-related screening diagnoses: autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disabilities, and developmental coordination disorder; second, to quantify dysfunction and suffering in important social areas.\nESSENCE symptoms were continuously and categorically associated with deficiency in Self-Directedness and Cooperativeness and higher ratings of dysfunction and suffering. The impact of ESSENCE symptoms on these measures of mental health was found in a milder form in about 16% of all children and in a severe form in about 2%.\nTherapeutic interventions focusing on Self-Directedness and Cooperativeness might provide a novel method for child psychiatry in its approach to ESSENCE."}, {"Title": "Atypical antipsychotic augmentation strategies in the context of guideline-based care for the treatment of major depressive disorder.", "Abstract": "There is a growing body of evidence that supports the use of atypical antipsychotics as augmentation agents for nonpsychotic unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. Unfortunately, varying definitions of treatment-resistant depression, the limited evidence available for interventions after two or more treatment failures, and when and whether to use medications from nonantidepressant classes, remain a key gap in the knowledge base for clinicians. We identified and reviewed the following guidelines to discuss the status of augmentation therapy with atypical antipsychotic agents in MDD: American Psychiatric Association practice guidelines for treatment of patients with MDD; Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments clinical guidelines for the management of MDD in adults; National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for treatment and management of depression in adults; British Association of Psychopharmacology guidelines for treatment of depressive disorders; Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement healthcare guideline for MDD in adults in primary care; clinical practice recommendations for depression; international consensus statement on MDD; German Society of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Neurology guidelines for unipolar depression; and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry guidelines for biological treatment of unipolar depressive disorders in primary care. Reflecting the cumulative evidence in the past decade, augmentation strategies including atypical antipsychotic augmentation are recommended in most guidelines for partial or nonresponders, at the same stage as switching or combination strategies. However, there are few direct comparisons of different augmentation strategies and little information about the optimal duration of augmentation strategies or use in special populations. Clinicians should note that guidelines are derived from an evolving database of evidence and cannot take into account the myriad of clinical variables that differ between individual patients. Therefore, they are intended to provide a useful framework for the management of depression and should be used in conjunction with other recognized sources of patient information and the application of clinical wisdom."}, {"Title": "Randomised controlled trial of therapeutic assessment versus usual assessment in adolescents with self-harm: 2-year follow-up.", "Abstract": "An earlier randomised controlled trial demonstrated improved treatment engagement in adolescents who received Therapeutic Assessment (TA) versus Assessment As Usual (AAU), following an emergency presentation with self-harm.\nTo determine 2-year outcomes for the same adolescents focusing on frequency of Accident and Emergency (A&E) self-harm presentations and treatment engagement.\nPatients in the TA groups (n=35) and the AAU group (n=34) were followed up 2 years after the initial assessment.

Also, few studies have analyzed whether physician sex moderates the influence of patients' or clinical situations' characteristics on pain management practices or its mediating processes. Therefore, our goal was to explore whether physician sex moderates the effects of patient (distressed) pain behaviors and diagnostic evidence of pathology (EP) on treatment prescriptions and referrals for chronic low-back pain, and to explore the mediating role of pain credibility judgments and psychological attributions on these effects. A total of 310\u00a0general practitioners (GPs; 72.6% women) participated in a between-subjects design, 2\u00a0(patient pain behaviors) \u00d7 2 (EP) \u00d7 2 (GP sex) \u00d7 2 (patient sex). GPs were presented with vignettes depicting a fe(male) chronic low-back pain patient, with(out) distress and with(out) EP (eg, herniated disc). GPs judged the patient's pain and the probability of treatment prescriptions and referrals. Results showed that EP had a larger effect on male than on female physicians' referrals to psychology/psychiatry. Also, GP sex moderated the pain judgments that accounted for the effect of EP and pain behaviors on prescriptions. These findings suggest framing medical decision-making as a process influenced by gender assumptions.\nThis paper shows that physician sex moderates the influence of clinical cues on pain management practices and the mediating role of pain judgments on these effects. It may potentially increase clinicians' awareness of the influence of gender assumptions on pain management practices and contribute to the development of more gender-sensitive services."}, {"Title": "Compared to what?

Most positive reports have compared head circumference (HC) in ASD (an excellent proxy for early brain size) with well-known reference norms.

Comparison of 330 longitudinally gathered HC measures between birth and 18 months from male children with autism (n = 35) and typically developing control subjects (n = 22).\nIn systematic review, comparisons with locally recruited control subjects were significantly less likely to identify EBO in ASD than norm-based studies (p < .001). Through systematic review and analysis of new data, we replicate seminal reports of EBO in ASD relative to classical HC norms but show that this overgrowth relative to norms is mimicked by patterns of HC growth age in a large contemporary community-based sample of US children (n ~ 75,000). Controlling for known HC norm biases leaves inconsistent support for a subtle, later emerging and subgroup specific pattern of EBO in clinically ascertained ASD versus community control subjects.\nThe best-replicated aspects of EBO reflect generalizable HC norm biases rather than disease-specific biomarkers. The potential HC norm biases we detail are not specific to ASD research but apply throughout clinical and academic medicine."}, {"Title": "When and why should mentally ill prisoners be transferred to secure hospitals: a proposed algorithm.", "Abstract": "For reasons well known and researched in detail, worldwide prevalence rates for mental disorders are much higher in prison populations than in general, not only for sentenced prisoners but also for prisoners on remand, asylum seekers on warrant for deportation and others. Moreover, the proportion of imprisoned individuals is rising in most countries. Therefore forensic psychiatry must deal not only with the typically young criminal population, vulnerable to mental illness due to social stress and at an age when rates of schizophrenia, suicide, drug abuse and most personality disorders are highest, but also with an increasingly older population with age-related diseases such as dementia. While treatment standards for these mental disorders are largely published and accepted, and scientific evidence as to screening prisoners for mental illness is growing, where to treat them is dependent on considerations for public safety and local conditions such as national legislation, special regulations and the availability of treatment facilities (e.g., in prisons, in special medical wards within prisons or in secure hospitals). While from a medical point of view a mentally ill prisoner should be treated in a hospital, the ultimate decision must consider these different issues.

This paper reviews the topic of publication bias with a focus on drugs prescribed for psychiatric conditions, especially depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism. Publication bias is pervasive; although psychiatry/psychology may be the most seriously afflicted field, it occurs throughout medicine and science. Responsibility lies with various parties (authors as well as journals, academia as well as industry), so the motives appear to extend beyond the financial interests of drug companies. The desire for success, in combination with cognitive biases, can also influence academic authors and journals. Amid the flood of new medical information coming out each day, the attention of the news media and academic community is more likely to be captured by studies whose results are positive or newsworthy. In the peer review system, a fundamental flaw arises from the fact that authors usually write manuscripts after they know the results. This allows hindsight and other biases to come into play, so data can be \"tortured until they confess\" (a detailed example is given). If a \"publishable\" result cannot be achieved, non-publication remains an option. To address publication bias, various measures have been undertaken, including registries of clinical trials. Drug regulatory agencies can provide valuable unpublished data. It is suggested that journals borrow from the FDA review model.

Examining of critical respective questions such as: whether there are any universal 'typical' emotional reactions to be found in each and every known culture, indicating their intrinsic existence as being a part of the human condition; whether there are 'basic' and 'secondary' emotions; whether emotions are merely bodily events, patterns of behavioural reactions to given types of stimuli or whether they rely inevitably on their cognitive content; whether emotions are necessarily intentional (in Brentano's sense) viz. are inevitably about a real or an imaginary object or whether there can be objectless emotional states; whether emotions are in a significant sense rational or fundamentally irrational responses and so forth. Moreover, more recent experimental data advocating for one or the other response to the aforementioned fundamental questions are scrutinized.\nIn both conceptual research (including the works of thinkers such as the highly influential contributions of Darwin, James, Cannon, Freud, Ryle and Sartre or contemporary attempts such as the ones of theorists like Solomon, Nash, Rey, Pugmire and Lyons) as well as in comprehensive theoretical schemes combining experimental data (such as the ones provided by the works of Schachter and Singer, Ekman and Friesen, Panksepp, Damasio and Griffiths), there seems to be a radical indeterminacy of conceptual content and fundamental features of emotions in general, as well as of particular emotional states. Furthermore, there is an apparent conceptual incapability to include each and every feature of emotional states within a single comprehensive definition without making reference to contingent particularities of their biological instantiation.\nAt least in the crucial concept of emotional states, when examined carefully, it seems that (1) there are substantial barriers to the ambitious quest for a scientific grounding of taxonomies and definitions of phenomena like emotions, due to the inability to provide an independent verification of scientific propositions; (2) all major approaches in Psychology and Psychiatry seem to have serious shortcomings in defining emotions; (3) such shortcomings have to do with fundamental issues such as the nature of mental states; (4) most ordinary concepts of emotions utilized by clinicians and researchers tend to be circular and question begging when scrutinized theoretically; and (5) historically dominant beliefs, values and cultural systems tend to influence heavily both the acceptability of such representations of emotions as well as their very nature."}, {"Title": "Mental disorders are not brain disorders.", "Abstract": "As advances in neuroscience and genetics reveal complex associations between brain structures, functions and symptoms of mental disorders, there have been calls for psychiatric classifications to be reconfigured, to conceptualize mental disorders as disorders of the brain. In this paper, I argue that this view is mistaken, and that the level at which we identify mental disorders is, and should be, the person, not the brain. This is not to deny physicalism or argue that the mental realm is somehow distinct from the physical, but rather to suggest the things that are going 'wrong' in mental disorder are picked out at the person-level: they are characterized by breaches in epistemic, rational, evaluative, emotional, social and moral norms. However, as our scientific understanding of the brain becomes advanced, what makes an identified neurobiological difference in brain structure or functioning indicative of pathology is its association with these behaviours at the person-level. Instead of collapsing psychiatry into biomedicine, biomedicine may benefit from drawing closer to the expertise of psychiatry, as it is able to accommodate social, psychological and biological explanations while focusing on the person, within their environment."}, {"Title": "The voice-hearer.", "Abstract": "For 25 years, the international Hearing Voices Movement and the U.K. Hearing Voices Network have campaigned to improve the lives of people who hear voices.

Rather than the pursuit of economic wealth, the future goal of society should consist of improving each individual's mental \"capital\" in the different stages of life, which will ultimately lead to an increase in the level of mental wealth in society as a whole. The disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of psychiatric disorders have outweighed diseases such as cancers and cardiovascular disorders, and the early detection and prevention of psychiatric disorders has become a top-priority issue. We, psychiatrists, are thus professionals markedly responsible for public wealth. Psychiatric disorders and a person with a disorder should be understood from pluralistic perspectives; universality as a brain disorder and, on the other hand, individuality as a person who lives a personal life in pursuit of personal values. Here, I redefine psychiatry as medical science of the brain, mind, and social life, where a balanced model between medical treatment in academia and social support in the community may constitute a new way of working (NWW) for psychiatrists. It is time to launch NWW for young psychiatrists to make a true difference for individuals with psychiatric disorders.

The guideline eased restrictions for the endocrine treatment of transsexual adolescents. A medical specialist can start treating transsexual adolescents at the age of 15 after the diagnosis of GID. It recommends that transsexual adolescents (Tanner stage 2 [mainly 12-13 years of age]) are treated by endocrinologists to suppress puberty with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists until the age of 15 years old, after which cross-sex hormones may be given. Female-to-male transsexuals do not necessarily want to start androgen therapy before presenting female secondary sexual characteristics because androgen can easily stop menstruation, cause beard growth, and lower the voice. On the contrary, male-to-female transsexuals want to start estrogen therapy before presenting male secondary sexual characteristics because estrogen cannot alter the beard and low voice. It is important to identify children with gender dysphoria in school and help them receive medical advice. However, approximately half of school teachers think that children with gender dysphoria are very rare and they do not know of the notification from Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, JAPAN, which aims to help children with gender dysphoria. The revision of the guideline for the treatment of transsexual people and endocrine treatment of transsexual adolescents by medical specialists may prevent them from attempting suicide, being depressive, and refusing to attend school. Furthermore, the treatment may help avoid mental disorders, aid being employed with the desired sexuality, and, subsequently, getting married and having children."}, {"Title": "[Gender identity disorder and related sexual behavior problems in children and adolescents: from the perspective of development and child psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The present paper reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on children and adolescents with gender identity disorder. The organizational framework underlying this review is one that presents gender behavior in children and adolescents as a continuum rather than as a dichotomy of normal versus abnormal categories. Theories of normative gender development, prevalence, assessment, developmental trajectories, and comorbidity were investigated. There is a greater fluidity and likelihood of change in the pre-pubertal period. It was reported that the majority of affected children had been eventually developing a homosexual orientation. As an approach to determine the prevalence of GID in clinical samples in our child psychiatry clinic, screening instruments that include items on cross-gender or cross-sex identification were used. We applied the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Of the 113 items in the Japanese version of the CBCL, there are two measures of cross-gender identification: \"behaves like opposite sex\" and \"wishes to be opposite sex.\" Like the other items, they are scored on a 3-point scale of: 0-not true, 1- somewhat true, and 2-very true. Our study of 323 clinically-referred children aged 4-15 years reported that, among the boys, 9.6% assigned a score of 1 (somewhat true) or a score of 2 (very true) to the two items. The corresponding rates for the clinically-referred girls were 24.5%. The item of diagnosis of GID in our clinical sample was significantly higher than in non-referred children, reported as 2-5% using the same method. Two clinical case histories of screened children are also presented. Both of them were diagnosed with PDDNOS. Together with the literature review, most of the gender-related symptoms in autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) could be related to the behavioral and psychological characteristics of autism as shown in case histories. ASD subjects in adolescence can sometimes develop a unique confusion of identity that occasionally exaggerates to gender-related problems. However, these views do not explain all cases; true comorbidity of ASD and GID should be considered. A full assessment including evaluation of the family, school, and social environment is essential as other emotional and behavioral problems are very common and unresolved issues in the child's environment are often present e. g., loss. Separation problems are particularly common in the younger group. Intervention should aim to assist development, particularly that of gender identity. It should focus on ameliorating the comorbid problems and difficulties in the child's life and reducing the distress experienced by the child."}, {"Title": "[How to improve the system of classification and diagnosis of depressive syndrome].", "Abstract": "The confusion regarding the system of classification and diagnosis of depressive syndrome must be promptly addressed. One issue is to discriminate between antidepressant-effective and -resistant depression. Another is to diagnose depressive disorders even if depression is mild. It is important as an immediate response to appropriately use DSM and ICD and the treatment guideline of the Japanese Society of Mood disorders. The system of dimensional classifications and diagnoses of depressive syndrome, including the axes of symptoms, social backgroud, and social function, should be more fully utilized in psychiatry. It may be possible to modify it according to associated areas such as occupational mental health, liaison psychiatry, and suicide prevention."}, {"Title": "[Treatment of psychiatric symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders with comorbid sleep apnea syndrome: a case report].", "Abstract": "Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is characterized by apnea and hypopnea during sleep. SAS manifests various symptoms, and can become a risk factor for a variety of diseases. Typical psychiatric presentations of SAS are depressive symptoms, and those resembling negative symptoms in schizophrenia. We report two patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Both patients showed the partial improvement of psychiatric symptoms with pharmacotherapy. After diagnosing comorbid SAS and subsequent treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the psychiatric symptoms improved. The first case was a 54-year-old woman, who presented with auditory hallucinations and delusions and was diagnosed with schizophrenia at 32 years of age. Her positive symptoms responded immediately to medication; however, her negative symptoms persisted despite switching to atypical antipsychotics. We diagnosed her with SAS using pulse oximetry and portable polysomnography (PSG), and, after treatment with CPAP, her fatigue and shallow sleep improved, as well as her quality of life (QOL). The second case was is a 61-year-old man, who presented with delusions of persecution and was diagnosed with delusional disorder at 49 years of age. His delusional symptoms fluctuated under medication, and repeatedly worsened under stressful situations. We suspected SAS as a Complicating factor, and diagnosed him with severe SAS using PSG. After treatment with CPAP, his hypertension and delusions of persecution improved. Screening for SAS is available in psychiatric hospitals and outpatient clinics. We believe that the possibility of comorbid SAS in psychiatric patients should be more widely acknowleged in clinical psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[An introduction to geriatric psychiatry: recent topics].", "Abstract": "In this lecture, first, the author reported the latest national data for the prevalence of dementia.

In the midst of these, Japanese people have felt to lose the traditional values and common sense they used to share, and it has become necessary to build a new consciousness. Engaged in psychiatry and psychiatric care under these circumstances, we have to analyze the challenges we face and to brainstorm on appropriate prescriptions that can be applied to solve the problems. Five points in particular were brought up: [1] The persistently high number of suicides. [2] The increase in depression and overflowing numbers of patients visiting clinics and outpatient departments at hospitals. [3] The absolute shortage of child psychiatrists. [4] Little progress with the transition from hospitalization-centered to community-centered medical care. [5] The disappearance of beds for psychiatry patients from general hospitals. The situations surrounding these five issues were briefly analyzed and problems were pointed out. The following are five problems that psychiatry is facing: 1) A lack of large clinical trials compared to the rest of the world. 2) The drug lag and handling of global trials. 3) The lack of staff involved in education and research (in the field of psychiatry). 4) Following the DSM diagnostic criteria dogmatically, without differentiating therapeutics. 5) Other medical departments, the industry, patients, and their families are demanding objective diagnostic techniques. After analyzing the problems, and discussing to some extent what kind of prescription may be considered to solve the problems, I gave my opinion. (1) The first problem is the deep-rooted prejudice and discrimination against psychiatric disorders that continue to be present among Japanese people. The second problem is the government's policy of low remuneration (fees) for psychiatric services. The third problem, symbolic of the situation, is the fact that the \"psychiatry exception\" system (unbalanced ratio of staff to psychiatric patients) is still present today. (2) To reach a fundamental solution, the policy of low fees for psychiatric services has to be abolished. (3) Multi-disciplinary medical teams, as practiced in other developed countries, is not yet adequately applied in Japan. From the aspect of medical fees, it is not adequately encouraged either. The only place where team medicine is actually practiced is in the \"forced hospitalization\" ward, but, as stated in the supplementary resolution of the Japanese diet (national assembly), high-quality medicine should not only be practiced in the \"forced hospitalization\" ward, but also in general psychiatry. (4) The policy of transition from hospitalization-centered to community-centered medical care, which was initiated a long time ago by the Japanese government, is not proceeding in reality, and it is time that we put our heads together and find ways to overcome this problem. It is significant that \"psychiatric disorders\" have been included as one of the \"five diseases,\" (a system adopted by the government concerning community health care), and now we have the best opportunity to improve community-centered psychiatric care."}, {"Title": "[The trends of mood disorders in ICD-11: bipolar and depressive disorders].", "Abstract": "The international classification of diseases 11th (ICD-11) revision is due by 2015. The ICD-11 beta draft has recently been released, which includes a prospective change in the content of mood disorders. The ICD-11 may separate the disorders into bipolar and depressive disorders as a consequence of an evaluation for the feasibility of a meta-structure for mental and behavioral disorders. In addition, the bipolar disorders may be divided into type I and II disorders. The depressive disorders may include new diseases, i. e., disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, mixed depressive anxiety, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Our epidemiological data from patients with mood disorders diagnosed using the ICD-10 or DSM-IV have proven their utility in clinical use, and suggested a required revision for the criteria of the diagnosis. A part of persistent mood disorders, such as cyclothymia and dysthymia, seem to be the prodromal state of bipolar disorders. For an accurate assessment of manic and hypomanic episodes, a precise estimation of the physiological effects of antidepressants as well as a sufficient review of clinical information from family members of patients are mandatory. The mixed affective episode may be deleted in the new version, because our data also indicate that this episode is a very rare clinical state. Moreover, it appears that inpatients with bipolar II disorder diagnosed by the DSM-IV in our hospital showed heterogeneous clinical properties, such as the onset age and interval between the first depressive and first hypomanic episode. After a worldwide and intensive discussion, it appears that the newly revised ICD-11 will be an advanced scientific tool for psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Use of narratives to assess language disorders in an inpatient pediatric psychiatric population.", "Abstract": "A large proportion of child psychiatry patients have undiagnosed language disorders.

Results showed that (1) more than twice as many children were identified with language impairment when both narrative and core language assessment were used, and (2) core language comprehension and complex verbal working memory were the strongest predictors of narrative production, while core language comprehension, a less complex working-memory task, and social skills best predicted narrative comprehension.

The natural flavonoid luteolin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, mast cell-blocking, and neuroprotective effects. It was shown to improve cognitive performance in a mouse model of ASD, but its effect in humans has not been adequately studied.\nThe goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness and tolerability in white children with ASD of a dietary supplement containing 2 flavonoids (>95% pure), luteolin (100 mg/capsule, from chamomile) and quercetin (70 mg/capsule), and the quercetin glycoside rutin (30 mg/capsule) from the Sophora japonica leaf, formulated in olive kernel oil to increase oral absorption.\nFifty children (4-10 years old; 42 boys and 8 girls) with ASD were enrolled in a 26-week, prospective, open-label trial at the 2nd University Department of Psychiatry at \"Attikon\" General Hospital, Athens, Greece. Children were referred for the study by their respective physicians or came from the practice of the senior author. ASD diagnosis by clinical assessment was based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, symptom list and corroborated by using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. The dose of the study formulation used was 1 capsule per 10 kg weight per day with food. The primary outcome measures were the age-equivalent scores in the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales domains. Secondary outcomes included the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist, and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score. Data were measured at baseline, week 18, and week 26. Parents were interviewed for any possible improvements they noticed and instructed to report any unusual adverse events.\nA total of 40 children completed the protocol. There was a significant improvement in adaptive functioning as measured by using the VABS age-equivalent scores (8.43 months in the communication domain, 7.17 months in daily living skills, and 8 months in the social domain; P < 0.005), as well as in overall behavior as indicated by the reduction (26.6%-34.8%) in Aberrant Behavior Checklist subscale scores. Age, sex, and history of allergies had no effect on the results, whereas the initial level of functioning or difficulty did predict the final outcome in most of the measures used. There was a transient (1-8 weeks) increased irritability in 27 of the 50 participants.\nThese results are encouraging in that the combination of the flavonoids luteolin and quercetin seemed to be effective in reducing ASD symptoms, with no major adverse effects.

It is a reliable tool for confirming a diagnosis and evaluating the effect of treatments for sleep problems in patients with primary psychiatric diagnoses such as schizophrenia. In addition, actigraphy is an objective measure that circumvents the lack of insight and often unreliable self-reporting of mental health related problems. However, the literature regarding the use of actigraphy in research and clinical applications related to severe psychiatric populations is scarce. Amalgamation of the evidence is needed to advance the use of actigraphy in psychiatry. We summarized the literature to date related to the use of actigraphy in patients with psychotic disorders, specifically schizophrenia. We conducted a systematic review of journal databases. Sixty-six studies emerged from the search of the electronic search engines, 14 were RCTs/case-control studies and 14 were review/guideline papers and others were case studies. Results of the RCT/case-control studies comparing the use of actigraphy with patients versus control were summarized. Actigraphy not only allows for the objective evaluation of sleep habits and circadian rhythm disorders, but also helps to clarify and compare sleep and activity patterns among severe psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Additionally, actigraphy data can be used as an outcome measure for changes in sleep patterns either when primary psychotic disorders are treated and/or when the sleep disturbance associated with the psychotic disorder is treated. Finally, actigraphy serves as a supplementary tool to study neuropathology of movement-related psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "What future for neuroendocrinology in psychiatry?", "Abstract": "In psychiatry, neuroendocrine techniques were initially considered a potential \"window into the brain\" by indirectly marking central nervous system limbic dysfunction. At present this conception has evolved, owing to significant progress over the last decades demonstrating direct involvement of neuropeptides and neurohormones in psychiatric diseases. In a synchronic perspective, neuroendocrine investigations evaluate a functional status at a given moment in the evolution of the disease, which results from both etiopathogenic processes and compensatory homeostatic mechanisms. These vital physiological changes appear to be potential targets for novel hormonally based pharmacotherapies. However, in the past few years, the interest for the study of neuroendocrine dysregulations in psychiatric patients has declined. In order to better understand this relative disinterest, this article will attempt to shed light on strengths and limitations of the neuroendocrine approaches in psychiatry. It is necessary to bear in mind that the usefulness of these techniques in the clinical, pathophysiological and therapeutic fields depends largely on the selectivity of stimuli and the appropriateness of the methodologies used. Owing to the complexity of the clinical phenomena, multifactorial approaches (combining several neuroendocrine challenge tests to imaging, immunological, neurophysiological, neurochemical and/or genetic techniques) are to be privileged in psychiatric investigations. Despite the inherent limitations of these approaches, due to their technical and ethical constraints, the neuroendocrine strategy can inform modern clinical practice and lead to new breakthroughs in future science and practice."}, {"Title": "Prevalence and clinical correlations of catatonia in older adults referred to a liaison psychiatry service in a general hospital.", "Abstract": "To determine the frequency and clinical correlations of catatonia in older patients referred to a liaison psychiatry service in a general hospital.\nAll patients over 65 years referred to liaison psychiatry were screened for catatonic phenomena with the Bush-Francis Catatonia Screening Instrument (BFCSI) between January and May 2012.

This study aimed to identify the impacts seclusion has on an individual using the Impact of Events - Revised (IES-R), a standardized and widely used measure of trauma symptoms, and measure the effectiveness of a post-seclusion counselling intervention in mitigating the experience of seclusion-related trauma and reducing time spent in seclusion. The study design involved a comparison of the seclusion-related trauma and time in seclusion that was experienced by consenting patients managed on the two inpatient wards of Alfred Psychiatry. To investigate the efficacy of post-seclusion counselling to reduce event-related trauma as well as the use of seclusion, a brief single-session intervention was piloted comparing outcomes for patients treated on a ward implementing semistructured post-seclusion counselling and patients treated on a ward continuing with post-seclusion support as usual. A total of 31 patients consented to participate, with approximately 47% reporting trauma symptoms consistent with 'probable post-traumatic stress disorder' (IES-R total score, >33), although there was no difference in trauma experience between groups. Significantly fewer hours were spent in seclusion for patients treated on the ward piloting the post-seclusion counselling intervention. Findings, therefore, highlight not only the potential for significant trauma stemming from a seclusion event, but also the capacity for the implementation of such interventions as post-seclusion counselling to raise awareness of the need to minimize time spent in seclusion for patients."}, {"Title": "Frequency of latent and smear positive tuberculosis in chronic psychotic disorders.", "Abstract": "Screening is one of the ways to combat Tuberculosis (TB) and should be mostly concentrated on groups showing some symptoms of the disease.

Therefore, a forensic psychiatrist has an important role in detection of malingering. While several studies evaluate diagnostic tests, it is less known what symptoms are more likely to be imitated by malingerers.\nIn a prospective study 45 malingerers, who were diagnosed according to interviews by two forensic psychiatrists, from defendants with a judicial order for evaluation of mental status and criminal responsibility during a period of eighteen months were examined in legal medicine center of Tehran. Participants were assessed in another interview to determine symptoms. Dichotomous symptoms in felony and misdemeanor groups were analyzed using fisher's exact test. The level of statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.\nThirty-eight malingerers were charged with misdemeanors and seven with felonies. Behavioral symptoms were most frequently faked by 35 participants (77.8%). Participants charged with criminal accusation had a significantly lower mean age (P=0.032) and a higher level of education (P=0.008) than other non-criminal defendants. A statistically significant increase in memory function problems was demonstrated in the misdemeanor group (P=0.040). With regard to dual symptom imitation, statistically significant correlations were observed between thought content and perceptual symptoms (P=0.048) for felonies and mood & affect and thought process symptoms (P=0.034), mood & affect and behavioral symptoms (P=0.000) and cognitive function and behavioral symptoms (P=0.039) for misdemeanors. In general, many simulators attempted to mimic simple symptoms of behavioral disorders. Probably felony offenses need less accurate programming; therefore, their rates are higher in older, less educated participants.\nThis study demonstrated that differences between presenting symptoms among different offenses may not be useful in detection of malingering,; however, unusual dual symptom imitations may be useful, particularly when standard tests are not performed."}, {"Title": "Mental health care Monitor Older adults (MEMO): monitoring patient characteristics and outcome in Dutch mental health services for older adults.", "Abstract": "Information on which older adults attend mental health care and whether they profit from the care they receive is important for policy-makers. To assess this information in daily practice, the \"Mental health care Monitor Older adults\" (MEMO) was developed in the Netherlands. The aim of this paper is to describe MEMO and the older adults who attend outpatient mental health care regarding their predisposing and enabling characteristics and need for care. In MEMO all patients referred to the division of old age psychiatry of the participating mental health care organisations are assessed at baseline and monitored at 4, 8 and 12-month follow-up. Primary outcomes are mental and social functioning, consumer satisfaction, and type of treatment provided (MEMO Basic). Over the years, MEMO Basic is repeated. In each cycle, additional information on specific patient groups is added (e.g. mood disorders). Data collection is supported by a web-based system for clinicians, including direct feedback to monitor patients throughout treatment. First results at baseline showed that the majority of patients that entered the division of old age psychiatry was female (69%), had low education (83%), lived alone (53%), was depressed (42%) and had a comorbid condition (82%). It seemed that older immigrants were not sufficiently reached. The current study is the first in the Netherlands to evaluate patient characteristics and outcome in mental health care provided for older adults in day-to-day practice.

Prescription information was extracted from the clinical records of all current outpatients at two New Zealand public mental health centres. This included the type and duration of HS use and documentation of a clinical review of longstanding (>3 months) use, patient sex, age and ICD10 diagnoses. One-third of the patients (35.2%) were prescribed at least one HS; this was longstanding in two-thirds (69%). One in 10 had a coprescription of more than one HS drug. HS use was related to female sex and diagnosis, being more common among patients with nonpsychotic than psychotic disorders and very infrequent in patients on clozapine. In most longstanding cases, a clinical review had been documented. The logistic regression confirmed female sex, diagnosis and clozapine all as independent predictors of HS prescription. HS prescribing in psychiatric illness is more common than in the general population, often longstanding, with polypharmacy being common. The frequent use of antipsychotic drugs as HSs is of concern, given their side-effect profile. As there are risks involved with longstanding HS use, a better rationale for the role of medication in the management of sleep problems in psychiatric disorders is needed."}, {"Title": "Health status, emotional/behavioral problems, health care use, and expenditures in overweight/obese US children/adolescents.", "Abstract": "To examine the association of overweight/obesity with health, health care utilization, and expenditures in a national sample of 10- to 17-year-old children and adolescents.\nSecondary analysis of 2005 to 2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data (n = 17,224). Outcome measures included suboptimal health, emotional/behavioral problems, health care utilization, and expenditures.\nOverweight and obese children and adolescents had greater risk of suboptimal health (adjusted risk ratio [ARR], 1.4 and 1.7; P < .01), use of prescriptions (ARR, both 1.1; P = .01), and emergency department visits (ARR, 1.2 and 1.1; P = .01); overweight children/adolescents had lower mean out-of-pocket expenditures (\u223c$100, P < .01); and obese children/adolescents had greater risk of emotional/behavioral problems (ARR, 1.2; P < .01) and specialist visits (ARR, 1.1; P = .01). The most common specialty referral among obese children/adolescents was psychiatry. Overweight and obesity were not associated with office visits or total expenditures. A greater proportions of children and adolescents with suboptimal health and emotional/behavioral problems had health care expenditures, and those with suboptimal health were more likely to have out-of-pocket expenditures.\nPediatric overweight and obesity affect child and adolescent health status, emotional/behavioral problems, and specific domains of health care utilization, but do not appear to be associated with total health care expenditures. Out-of-pocket expenditures are lower among overweight children and adolescents.

The major goals of personalized medicine are therefore to predict an individual's susceptibility to developing an illness, achieve accurate diagnosis, and optimize the most efficient and favorable response to treatment. The goal of achieving personalized medicine in psychiatry is a laudable one, because its attainment should be associated with a marked reduction in morbidity and mortality. In this review, we summarize an illustrative selection of studies that are laying the foundation towards personalizing medicine in major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. In addition, we present emerging applications that are likely to advance personalized medicine in psychiatry, with an emphasis on novel biomarkers and neuroimaging."}, {"Title": "Reasons for and factors associated with issuing sickness certificates for longer periods than necessary: results from a nationwide survey of physicians.", "Abstract": "Physicians' work with sickness certifications is an understudied field.

In the current study, physicians reporting handling sickness certification consultations at least weekly were included in the analyses, a total of 12,348.\nThe proportion of physicians reporting issuing sickness certificates for longer periods than actually necessary varied greatly between different types of clinics, with the highest frequency among those working at: occupational medicine, orthopedic, primary health care, and psychiatry clinics; and lowest among those working in: eye, dermatology, ear/nose/throat, oncology, surgery, and infection clinics. Logistic analyses showed that sickness certifying for longer periods than necessary due to limitations in the health care system was particularly common among physicians working at occupational medicine, orthopedic, and primary health care clinics. Sickness certifying for longer periods than necessary due to patient-related factors was much more common among physicians working at psychiatric clinics. In addition to differences between clinics, frequency of sickness certificates issued for longer periods than necessary varied by age, physicians' experiences of different situations, and perceived problems.\nThis study showed that physicians issued sickness certificates for longer periods than actually necessary quite frequently at some types of clinics.

The World Health Organisation identifies strong links between mental health status and development for individuals, communities and countries. In order to improve population mental health, countries need effective and accessible treatment, prevention, and promotion programmes. Achieving adequate support for mental health in any country requires a unified approach. Strong links between psychiatrists, community leaders and patients and families that are based on negotiation and respect, are vital for progress. When strong partnerships exist, they can contribute to community understanding and advancement of psychiatry. This is the first step towards scaling up good quality care for those living with mental illnesses, preventing illnesses in those at risk, and promoting mental health through work with other community sectors. Partnerships are needed to support education and research in psychiatry, and improvements in quality of care wherever psychiatry is practiced, including primary health and community mental health services, hospitals and private practice.

The effort to establish clarity often results in a fresh maze of evidence. In finding the way forward, it is tempting to abandon the scientific method, but that is not possible, since we deal with real human psychopathology, not just concepts to speculate over. Search for clear-cut definitions/diagnostic criteria in psychiatry must be relentless. There is a greater need to be ruthless and blunt in this, rather than being accommodative of diverse opinions. Investigative tests - psychological, serum, CSF, or neuroimaging - are only corroborative at present; they need to become definitive. Medicalisation appears most prominent in psychiatry; so, diagnostic proliferation and fuzziness appear inevitable. And yet, the established diagnostic entities need to forward greater and conclusive precision. Also, the need for clarity and precision must outweigh pandering to and mollifying diverse interests, moreso in the upcoming revision of diagnostic manuals. This is specially because the DSM-5, being an Association manual, may need to accommodate powerful member lobbies; and ICD-11 may similarly need to cater to diverse country lobbies. Finding precise biological correlates of psychiatric phenomena, whether through neuroimaging, molecular neurobiology and/or neurogenomics, is the right way forward. It is in the 1.5-kg structure in the cranium that all secrets of psychiatric conditions lie. Social forces, behavioural modification, psychosocial restructuring, study of intrapsychic processes, and philosophical insights are not to be discounted, but they are supplementary to the primary goal - studying and deciphering those brain processes that result in psychiatric malfunction. Experimental breakthroughs, both in psychiatric aetiology and therapeutics, will come mainly from biology and its adjunct, psychopharmacology; while supplementary and complementary breakthroughs will come from the psychosocial, cognitive and behavioural approaches; the support base will come from phenomenology, epidemiology, nosology and diagnostics; while insights and leads can hopefully come from many fields, especially the psychosocial, the behavioural, the cognitive and the philosophical. Major energies must now be marshalled towards finding biomarkers and deciphering the precise phenotype-genotype-endophenotype axis of psychiatric disorders. Energies also need to be focussed on unravelling those critical processes in the brain that tip the scale towards psychiatric disorders. At how those critical processes are set into motion by forces de novo, in utero, in the genes and their expression, by the environment's psychopathological social forces - stress, peer pressure, poverty, deprivation, alienation, malnutrition, discrimination of various types (caste, gender, race, etc.), mass conflicts (war, terror attacks, etc.), disasters (natural and man-made), religious/ideological fascism - or social institutions like marriage, family, work place, political governance, etc. Ultimately, we must decipher how the brain goes into malfunction when such varied forces impinge on it, which precise cortical areas and neuronal cellular and molecular processes are involved in such malfunction and its manifestation, as also which of these are involved when malfunction ceases and health is restored, and the psychosocial processes and institutions which aid such health restoration, as also those which promote well-being and help in primary prevention. Emphasis on the brain and its intimate neurological and molecular mechanisms will not impinge on, or nullify, importance of the 'mind,' wherein subtle and gross brain functions in the form of behaviour, thought and emotions in all their ramifications will continue to be the focus of psychological, cognitive, sociological, psychopharmacological, behavioural and philosophical research.

In particular, employees in SS were frequently exposed. More exposure was related to a higher degree of reporting incidents in writing to the workplace. However, exposure was not consistently related to self-rated seriousness of the incidents or attitudes that reflect accept of workplace threats and violence. Both threats and physical violence were rated within a moderate range of seriousness in all these areas of work.

Moreover, the expensive treatment of schizophrenia imposes a burden on health care providers and the wider society. Existing cost estimates for Sweden, however, are based on relatively small patient populations and need to be confirmed in a large register-based study.\nTo investigate the health care resource utilization and cost-of-illness in patients with schizophrenia in Sweden and to relate the costs to hospitalizations and global assessment of functioning (GAF).\nHospital-based registry data were combined with national registry data from a large patient population to get reliable estimates of the costs of schizophrenia in Sweden. Schizophrenia was defined by ICD-10 codes F20; F21; F23.1,2,8,9; F25.1,8,9. Registry data on socio-demographics and disease-related healthcare resource use in outpatient and inpatient care were obtained from Northern Stockholm Psychiatry. Data on pharmaceuticals were obtained from the National Board of Health and Welfare, and data on sick leave and early retirement were obtained from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency. Costs for community mental health care were not available at the individual level, but were estimated based on previous studies and aggregate cost data from Stockholm. Resource use data from the registries were combined with unit costs from publicly available sources. The study was conducted from a societal perspective, with indirect costs valued according to the human capital method.\nThe average annual psychiatric cost per patient with schizophrenia in 2008 was EUR 42700 (95% CI: EUR 41500-44000), based on a sample of 2161 patients. To this should be added costs for community mental health care of EUR 12400 per patient, giving a total cost of EUR 55100 per patient. The two largest cost items in the total costs were indirect costs due to lost productivity (60%) and community mental health care (22% of the total cost). Patients who were hospitalized in 2008 had greater psychiatric costs than those who were not, EUR 71700 vs. EUR 37700 (p<0.0001). Psychiatric costs were significantly and negatively correlated with GAF (p<0.001).\nThe major strengths of the study are the relatively large sample, and the linkage of patient-level clinical data on inpatient and outpatient care with national registry data on prescription pharmaceuticals, and days on social insurance. A limitation was that costs for informal care and primary care were not included in the data, but previous studies suggest that these costs items are small compared to other costs for schizophrenia. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICIES AND FUTURE RESEARCH: Costs were strongly related to hospitalization and GAF, suggesting that attempts to improve global functioning and avoid hospitalizations by means of effective treatment and rehabilitation might not only decrease suffering for patients and relatives, but also reduce the societal cost of schizophrenia. A detailed knowledge of the societal costs can also be helpful in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new treatment strategies to improve the care for patients with schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Patients leaving against medical advice: an inpatient psychiatric hospital-based study.", "Abstract": "To determine the frequency of patients leaving against medical advice (LAMA) in an inpatient psychiatric facility in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.\nDescriptive cross-sectional study.\nInstitute of Psychiatry, Benazir Bhutto Hospital, Rawalpindi, from August 2010 to February 2011.\nPatients who got admitted during study period irrespective of duration of illness and mode of admission were recruited through non-probability consecutive sampling and followed till discharge to determine their mode of leaving hospital.

Ownership of patient care is a complex area of trainee development that crosses multiple areas of evaluation and may lack clear behavioural definitions. In an effort to define ownership for educational purposes, the authors surveyed psychiatry teaching faculty and trainees about behaviours that would indicate that a physician is demonstrating ownership of patient care. Emerging themes were identified through analysis of narrative responses in this qualitative descriptive study. Forty-one faculty (54\u00a0%) and 29 trainees (52\u00a0%) responded. Both faculty and trainees identified seven core elements of ownership: advocacy, autonomy, commitment, communication, follow-through, knowledge and teamwork. These seven elements provide a consensus-derived behavioural definition that can be used to determine competency or identify deficits. The proposed two-step process enables supervisors to identify problematic ownership behaviours and determine whether there is a deficit of knowledge, skill or attitude. Further, the theory of planned behaviour is applied to better understand the relationship between attitudes, intentions and subsequent behaviour. By structuring the diagnosis of problems with ownership of patient care, supervisors are able to provide actionable feedback and intervention in a naturalistic setting.

All the studies reported that memantine is a safe drug with minimal drug interactions and a very acceptable adverse effect profile comparable to placebo.\nMemantine has demonstrated beneficial effects in some childhood disorders but the evidence is too limited at present and does not provide enough support of its efficacy to advocate for its regular use in those conditions.

Among all medical subspecialties, psychiatry is uniquely suited to help guide the medical profession's response to the ethical, legal, and therapeutic challenges--especially with respect to boundaries--posed by the rapid proliferation of social media in medicine. Ironically, while limited guidelines exist for other branches of medicine, guidelines for the responsible use of social media and information technology in psychiatry are lacking.\nTo collect data about patterns of use of electronic communications and social media among practicing psychiatrists and to establish a conceptual framework for developing professional guidelines.\nA structured survey was developed to assess the use of email, texting, and social media among the active membership of the Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry (GAP) to gain insight into current practices across a spectrum of the field and to identify areas of concern not addressed in existing guidelines. This survey was distributed by mail and at an annual meeting of the GAP and a descriptive statistical analysis was conducted with SPSS.\nOf the 212 members, 178 responded (84% response rate). The majority of respondents (58%) reported that they rarely or never evaluated their online presence, while 35% reported that they had at some time searched for information online about patients. Only 20% posted content about themselves online and few of these restricted that information. Approximately 25% used email to communicate with patients, and very few obtained written consent to do so.\nDiscipline-specific guidelines for psychiatrists' interactions with social media and electronic communications are needed. Informed by the survey described here, a review of the literature, and consensus opinion, a framework for developing such a set of guidelines is proposed. The model integrates four key areas: treatment frame, patient privacy, medico-legal concerns, and professionalism. This conceptual model, applicable to many psychiatric settings, including clinical practice, residency training, and continuing medical education, will be helpful in developing discipline-wide guidelines for psychiatry and can be applied to a decision-making process by individual psychiatrists in day-to-day practice."}, {"Title": "The DSM-5 and forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In his first Law and Psychiatry column for the Journal of Psychiatric Practice, the author discusses potential forensic consequences of the publication of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). While the transition to DSM-5 may prove challenging for both patients and clinicians, the scrutiny and adversarial process associated with forensic psychiatric practice will entail a unique set of challenges. The philosophy of innovation behind the DSM-5, and the attendant changes, could lead to some unintended consequences, particularly in medicolegal settings. This column highlights some of the major changes in DSM-5 and explores points of particular concern for forensic psychiatric practice, such as the move toward a non-multiaxial diagnostic system and dimensional severity ratings being superimposed on certain categorical diagnoses. The innovative changes featured in DSM-5, and the controversies surrounding some of them, could yield an environment of increased cynicism in courts of law, with renewed skepticism regarding mental health diagnoses and the forensic psychiatrists who testify about them. Fortunately, the best method for forensic psychiatric practice in this environment of change is to continue to adhere to a meticulous and transparent medicolegal process, with recognition that changes in the diagnostic manual will seldom alter essential medicolegal conclusions. Forensic psychiatrists may enhance their credibility and the strength of the opinions they offer by proactively illustrating how nuances in diagnosis do not change legally defined constructs such as insanity or incompetence."}, {"Title": "A retrospective of publications addressing suicidal behaviour in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 1967-2012.", "Abstract": "To review publications addressing suicidal behaviour in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 1967-2012.\nA PubMed/MEDLINE search using the words suicide, attempted suicide (and their synonyms) and Aust NZ J Psychiatr was carried out, and an examination of all tables of contents of the journal for the years 1967-2012 was performed.\nIn 342 (7.4%) of 4599 articles there was reference to suicidal behaviour.

The deposition of A\u03b2 leads to degenerative changes in the cerebral vessel system (thickening of the vessel wall, microaneurysm, constriction of vascular lumen, dissection), which favour the development of the clinical symptomatology most often associated with CAA. Besides haemorrhages, cerebral ischaemia, transient neurological symptoms, leukoencephalopathy as well as cognitive decline and even dementia may appear in connection with CAA. A definite diagnosis of CAA can only be made on the basis of a pathological assessment, even though diagnostic findings of cerebral neuroimaging and clinical symptoms allow the diagnosis of a probable CAA. At present, no causal therapy options are available. Although CAA is placed within the range of neurological illnesses, psychiatric symptoms such as cognitive impairment, personality change or behavioural problems as well as depression are plausible clinical manifestations of CAA and may even dominate the clinical picture.

This study examined the relationships among maternal history of childhood abuse, maternal depression, and parenting style in the context of parenting a psychiatrically ill child, with an emphasis on examining maternal emotional abuse and neglect. We hypothesized that maternal childhood emotional abuse would be associated with maladaptive parenting strategies (lower levels of maternal acceptance and higher levels of psychological control), independent of maternal depression severity and other psychosocial risk factors.\nNinety-five mother-child dyads (children ages 7-18) were recruited from child mental health centers where children were receiving treatment for at least one internalizing disorder. Participating mothers met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. Mothers reported on their own childhood abuse histories and children reported on their mothers' parenting.\nRegression analyses demonstrated that maternal childhood emotional abuse was associated with child reports of lower maternal acceptance and greater psychological control, controlling for maternal depression severity, and other psychosocial risk factors.\nWhen treating psychiatrically ill children, it is important for a child's clinician to consider mothers' childhood abuse histories in addition to their history of depression.

Among the factors that may lower agreement that have been discussed is informant credibility, reliability, or psychopathology, which is of interest in this paper. We tested three different models, namely, the accuracy, the distortion, and an integrated so-called combined model, that conceptualize parental ratings to assess child psychopathology. The data comprise ratings of child psychopathology from multiple informants (mother, therapist and kindergarten teacher) and ratings of maternal psychopathology. The children were patients in a preschool psychiatry unit (N=247). The results from structural equation modeling show that maternal ratings of child psychopathology were biased by maternal psychopathology (distortion model). Based on this statistical background, we suggest a method to adjust biased maternal ratings. We illustrate the maternal bias by comparing the ratings of mother to expert ratings (combined kindergarten teacher and therapist ratings) and show that the correction equation increases the agreement between maternal and expert ratings. We conclude that this approach may help to reduce misclassification of preschool children as 'clinical' on the basis of biased maternal ratings."}, {"Title": "The screen for cognitive impairment in psychiatry: diagnostic-specific standardization in psychiatric ill patients.", "Abstract": "The Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP) is a simple and easy to administer scale developed for screening cognitive deficits.

This kind of provision, also extols a significant cost to the society at large in terms of significant direct and indirect costs. A cost that may be even higher in times of severe socio-economic crisis.\nThis study, firstly, aims to examine the burden that the family members experience by caring for individuals with schizophrenia and the identification of the parameters, in a micro and macro level, that affect family burden.

Delirium is often difficult to diagnose and treatment is sometimes controversial with the use of antipsychotic medications, but it is common in a variety of patient care settings and remains an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in older adults. Dementia may affect a significant number of older adults and is associated with delirium, depression, frailty, and failure to thrive. Treatment of dementia is challenging and while medication interventions are common, environmental and problem solving therapies may have some of the greatest benefits. Finally, depression increases with age and is more likely to present with somatic complaints or insomnia and is more likely to be reported to a primary care physician than any other healthcare provider by older adults. Depression carries an increased risk for suicide in older adults and proven therapies should be initiated immediately. These three syndromes have great overlap, can exist simultaneously in the same patient, and often confer increased risk for each other. The primary care provider will undoubtedly benefit from a solid foundation in the identification, classification, and treatment of these common problems of older adulthood."}, {"Title": "Recent advances in neuroimaging biomarkers in geriatric psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Neuroimaging, both structural and functional, serve as useful adjuncts to clinical assessment, and can provide objective, reliable means of assessing disease presence and process in the aging population. In the following review we briefly explain current imaging methodologies. Then, we analyze recent developments in developing neuroimaging biomarkers for two highly prevalent disorders in the elderly population- Alzheimer's disease (AD) and late-life depression (LLD). In AD, efforts are focused on early diagnosis through in vivo visualization of disease pathophysiology. In LLD, recent imaging evidence supports the role of white matter ischemic changes in the pathogenesis of depression in the elderly, the \"vascular hypothesis.\" Finally, we discuss potential roles for neuroimaging biomarkers in geriatric psychiatry in the future."}, {"Title": "Violent behaviour in a forensic psychiatric hospital in Finland: an analysis of violence incident reports.", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper was to explore the frequency and provocation of physically violent incidents in a Finnish forensic psychiatric hospital. Three years (2007-2009) of violent incident reports were analysed retrospectively. The data were analysed by content analysis, and statistically by Poisson regression analysis. During the study period a total of 840 incidents of physical violence occurred. Six main categories were found to describe the provocation of violence where three of these categories seemed to be without a specified reason (61%), and three represented a reaction to something (36%). The risk for violent behaviour was highest for the civil patients (RR = 11.96; CI 95% 9.43-15.18; P < 0.001), compared to criminal patients (RR = 1). The civil patients represented 36.7% of the patients, and in 43.6% of the studied patient days, they caused 89.8% of the reported violence incidents. Patients undergoing a forensic mental examination did not frequently behave aggressively (RR = 1.97; CI 95% 0.91-4.28).

The goal is to improve the value of care. Current major programs tie quality measurements to reimbursement, including programs from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services: the Physician Quality Reporting System, the Electronic Health Record Incentive Program (and Meaningful Use), and Accountable Care Organizations. Many specialty boards, including the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, now require clinical practice quality measurements for maintenance of certification. Practitioners may find these programs confusing, overlapping, burdensome, and not clearly relevant to promoting better patient care. Yet, integrating quality metrics into practice has entered the mainstream and is increasingly tied to reimbursement. Further, over the next few years, most programs will switch from bonus incentives for participation to penalties for nonparticipation.

We focus on current R-fMRI-based prediction efforts, and survey R-fMRI used for neurosurgical planning. We identify gaps and needs for R-fMRI-based biomarker identification, highlighting the potential of emerging conceptual, analytical and cultural innovations (e.g., the Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC), open science initiatives, and Big Data) to address them.

Psychiatrists, being first and foremost doctors, have undertaken an identical basic training to their physician and surgical peers and, as in general medicine and surgery, the biomedical model is a central pillar of psychiatric practice. Within psychiatry, signs and symptoms are elicited, diagnoses made and very often physical interventions (in the form of psychotropic agents) are employed. However, familiar institutional conventions can conceal the fact that psychiatry suffers from greater uncertainty regarding its conceptual foundations than other fields of medicine. In fact, the conceptual challenges arising within psychiatry are reflected in its thriving field of philosophy, and although there exists a dedicated philosophy of medicine, no other specialty is equal to psychiatry's breadth of conceptual debate."}, {"Title": "Improving Quality of Life for Patients with Major Depressive Disorder by Increasing Hope and Positive Expectations with Future Directed Therapy (FDT).", "Abstract": "Impaired quality of life is a significant problem for people with major depressive disorder and is often not addressed through symptom remediation alone.

We propose that full insight into what should be conceived a \"xenomelia spectrum disorder\" will require interpretation of individual symptomatology in a social context. A proper social neuroscience of xenomelia respects the functional neuroanatomy of corporeal awareness, but also acknowledges the brain's plasticity in response to an individual's history, which is lived against a cultural background.

We aimed to elucidate the impact of different early environment on disease-related genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation in peripheral blood cells in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Compared with the same trauma-exposed controls (n = 108), gene-expression profiles of PTSD patients with similar clinical symptoms and matched adult trauma exposure but different childhood adverse events (n = 32 and 29) were almost completely nonoverlapping (98%). These differences on the level of individual transcripts were paralleled by the enrichment of several distinct biological networks between the groups. Moreover, these gene-expression changes were accompanied and likely mediated by changes in DNA methylation in the same loci to a much larger proportion in the childhood abuse (69%) vs. the non-child abuse-only group (34%). This study is unique in providing genome-wide evidence of distinct biological modifications in PTSD in the presence or absence of exposure to childhood abuse. The findings that nonoverlapping biological pathways seem to be affected in the two PTSD groups and that changes in DNA methylation appear to have a much greater impact in the childhood-abuse group might reflect differences in the pathophysiology of PTSD, in dependence of exposure to childhood maltreatment. These results contribute to a better understanding of the extent of influence of differences in trauma exposure on pathophysiological processes in stress-related psychiatric disorders and may have implications for personalized medicine."}, {"Title": "[Schizophrenia--a mild encephalitis?].", "Abstract": "The mild encephalitis (ME) hypothesis describes a subgroup of severe psychiatric disorders, with a focus on a subgroup of schizophrenias, in which low-level neuroinflammation (LLNI) represents the core in pathogenesis. LLNI is increasingly recognised in experimental neuroimmunology and is in principle able to explain various types of psychopathology. Epidemiology and course of schizophrenia are well compatible with the ME hypothesis, indirectly indicating that the ME subgroup may be rather large. With the ME model connected is a set of three contributing factors: genes, environment (especially infectious agents) and the immune system. The type of psychopathology observed in the individual case may heavily depend upon other conditions, e. g. pre-existing vulnerabilities. The first large-scale epidemiological study in psychiatry identified two factors during lifetime, severe infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases, as risk factors. This and clinical findings more and more support the ME hypothesis, e. g., activated monocytes or proteome changes in blood and slight CSF pathologies in more than 60 % of therapy-resistant schizophrenia, or activated microglia and dysconnectivity in neuroimaging."}, {"Title": "Treating melancholia at home: theoretical wisdom and grim reality in the career of E.C.

Born in France, but raised from early childhood in the United States, Seguin published widely, developed a high-profile New York City practice, and was named Clinical Professor of Diseases of the Mind and Nervous System at the College of Physicians and Surgeons (New York) in 1874. Typical of the era, he studied neurologic disorders, but also several conditions that today would be considered in the realm of psychiatry. One of his seminal papers was titled \"The treatment of mild cases of melancholia at home\" (1876). Contrary to the widespread practice of isolating patients in either rest homes or asylums, Seguin introduced and formalized treatment of depression within the household. Against this academic backdrop, Seguin returned home on October 31, 1882, to discover that his own wife, afflicted with long-standing depression and treated at home, had committed suicide after murdering their 3 children. The grim dichotomy between the confidently written paper and the reality of the treatment failure is a neurologic lesson in humility regarding diseases and their unpredictable outcomes."}, {"Title": "A comparison of Cohen's Kappa and Gwet's AC1 when calculating inter-rater reliability coefficients: a study conducted with personality disorder samples.", "Abstract": "Rater agreement is important in clinical research, and Cohen's Kappa is a widely used method for assessing inter-rater reliability; however, there are well documented statistical problems associated with the measure.

Nine raters (7 psychiatrists, a psychiatry resident and a social worker) participated as interviewers, either for the first or the second interviews, which were held 4 to 6 weeks apart. The interviews were held in order to establish a personality disorder (PD) diagnosis using DSM-IV criteria. Cohen's Kappa and Gwet's AC1 were used and the level of agreement between raters was assessed in terms of a simple categorical diagnosis (i.e., the presence or absence of a disorder). Data were also compared with a previous analysis in order to evaluate the effects of trait prevalence.\nGwet's AC1 was shown to have higher inter-rater reliability coefficients for all the PD criteria, ranging from .752 to 1.000, whereas Cohen's Kappa ranged from 0 to 1.00. Cohen's Kappa values were high and close to the percentage of agreement when the prevalence was high, whereas Gwet's AC1 values appeared not to change much with a change in prevalence, but remained close to the percentage of agreement. For example a Schizoid sample revealed a mean Cohen's Kappa of .726 and a Gwet's AC1of .853 , which fell within the different level of agreement according to criteria developed by Landis and Koch, and Altman and Fleiss.\nBased on the different formulae used to calculate the level of chance-corrected agreement, Gwet's AC1 was shown to provide a more stable inter-rater reliability coefficient than Cohen's Kappa. It was also found to be less affected by prevalence and marginal probability than that of Cohen's Kappa, and therefore should be considered for use with inter-rater reliability analysis."}, {"Title": "Sexual behaviours on acute inpatient psychiatric units.", "Abstract": "The purpose of the study was to assess the types and frequency of sexual behaviours displayed by patients during the first 2 weeks of admission to acute psychiatric units and what relationship these have to other challenging patient behaviours. The method used was a survey of sexual behaviours, conflict and containment events carried out by 522 patients during the first 2 weeks of admission in 84 wards in 31 hospitals in the South East of England. Incidents of sexual behaviour were common, with 13% of patients responsible for at least one incident. Although exposure was the most frequent of these behaviours, non-consensual sexual touching, was instigated by 1 in 20 patients. There were no differences in the numbers of sexual events between single sex and mixed gender wards. Few associations were found with the demographic features of perpetrators, although all those engaging in public masturbation were male, and male patients were more likely to sexually touch another without their consent. Single sex wards do not seem to necessarily offer significant protection to potentially vulnerable victims. Perpetrators do not seem to be predictable in advance, nor was there any common set or pattern of disruptive behavioural events indicating that a sexual incident was about to occur."}, {"Title": "Detachment, compartmentalization, and schizophrenia: linking dissociation and psychosis by subtype.", "Abstract": "To explain the phenomenological overlap between dissociation and schizophrenia, a dissociative subtype of schizophrenia has been proposed as a possibility. Dissociation is often believed to be organized on a continuum, although 2 qualitatively different phenomena can be distinguished in theory, research, and clinical practice: (a) states of separation from self or environment (detachment dissociation) and (b) inaccessibility of normally accessible mental contents (compartmentalization dissociation). This study used the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry module for the interview assessment of dissociation to investigate the relationships between PANSS subscales, detachment dissociation, and compartmentalization dissociation in a sample of 72 patients with schizophrenia. A confirmatory factor analysis sustained the bipartite model, yielding factors that grouped dissociative items around amnesia and depersonalization/derealization. The latter factor also contained identity disturbances and was therefore not entirely consistent with the theoretical formulations of detachment dissociation. It is important to note that the structure of those factors may be influenced by the symptoms of schizophrenia to which they were specifically linked: The factor containing depersonalization/derealization was connected to the positive symptoms subscale of the PANSS, whereas the factor containing amnesia was associated with the negative subscale. Hence, a dichotomy of dissociation is confirmed inasmuch as its subtypes are as distinguishable as PANSS subscales. This has implications on theoretical and clinical levels."}, {"Title": "Stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo)--broken heart and mind?", "Abstract": "Stress-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC), also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is characterized by severe but potentially reversible regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, ie, akinesia, in the absence of explanatory angiographic evidence of a coronary occlusion.

The pathophysiology of SIC remains largely unknown but catecholamines are believed to play a pivotal role. The diverse array of triggering events that have been linked to SIC are arbitrarily categorized as either emotional or somatic stressors.

Because of the absence of biological markers of disease in psychiatry, evidence-based psychiatry equates 'truth' with effecting changes in observable psychometric measures of behaviour. This is the same ontology underlying marketing 'spin' and all attempts to effect pre-determined behavioural change. In contrast, Merleau-Ponty's ontology rejects causality and mind/body duality, and views 'truth' as the expression of our deepest embodied feeling and perception of the world, which establishes all our thinking, and on which all our thinking relies, including 'scientific' thinking. Merleau-Ponty's ontology is therefore a preferable foundation for psychiatric practice, because it allows psychiatrists to consider the 'truth' of clinically important, but non-measurable, aspects of psychiatry while not excluding 'scientific' thinking, but recognising its limitations and potential for misuse."}, {"Title": "The duty to be well-informed: the case of depression.", "Abstract": "It is now an ethical dictum that patients should be informed by physicians about their diagnosis, prognosis and treatment options. In this paper, I ask: 'How informed are the 'informers' in clinical practice?' Physicians have a duty to be 'well-informed': patient well-being depends not just in conveying adequate information to patients, it also depends on physicians keeping up-to-date about: (1) popular misunderstandings of illnesses and treatments; and (2) the importance of patient psychology in affecting prognosis. Taking the case of depression as an entry point, this paper argues that medical researchers and physicians need to pay serious attention to the explanations given to patients regarding their diagnosis. Studies on lay understanding of depression show that there is a common belief that depression is wholly caused by a 'chemical imbalance' (such as 'low serotonin') that can be restored by chemically restorative antidepresssants, a claim that has entered 'folk wisdom'. However, these beliefs oversimplify and misrepresent the current scientific understanding of the causes of depression: first, there is consensus in the scientific community that the causes of depression include social as well as psychological triggers (and not just biochemical ones); second, there is significant dissensus in the scientific community over exactly what lower level, biological or biochemical processes are involved in causing depression; third, there is no established consensus about how antidepressants work at a biochemical level; fourth, there is evidence that patients are negatively affected if they believe their depression is wholly explained by (the vague descriptor) of 'biochemical imbalance'. I argue that the medical community has a duty, to provide patients with adequate information and to be aware of the negative health impact of prevalent oversimplifications-whatever their origins."}, {"Title": "The sertraline versus electrical current therapy for treating depression clinical study (select-TDCS): results of the crossover and follow-up phases.", "Abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising nonpharmacological therapy for major depression. In the Sertraline versus Electrical Current Therapy for Treating Depression Clinical Trial (SELECT-TDCS) trial, phase-I (Brunoni et al., JAMA Psychiatry, 2013) we found that tDCS is effective for the acute episode. Here, we describe tDCS effects during phases II (crossover) and III (follow-up) of this trial (NCTs: 01149889 and 01149213).\nPhase II (n = 25) was the open-label, crossover phase in which phase-I nonresponders who had received sham-tDCS received a 10-day course of active-tDCS. In phase-III (n = 42), all active-tDCS responders (>50% Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) improvement or MADRS \u2264 12) were enrolled to a 24-week, follow-up phase in which a maximum of nine tDCS sessions were performed-every other week for 3 months and, thereafter, once a month for the subsequent 3 months-sessions would be interrupted earlier whether the subject relapsed. TDCS was applied at 2 mA/30 min, with the anode over the left and the cathode over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Relapse was the outcome measure.\nIn phase-II, 52% of completers responded to tDCS. In phase-III, the mean response duration was 11.7 weeks. The survival rate per Kaplan-Meier analysis was 47%. Patients with treatment-resistant depression presented a much lower 24-week survival rate as compared to nonrefractory patients (10% vs. 77%, OR = 5.52; P < .01). Antidepressant use (sertraline 50 mg/day, eight patients) was not a predictor of relapse. TDCS was well tolerated and with few side effects.\nContinuation tDCS protocols should be optimized as to prevent relapse among tDCS responders, particularly for patients with baseline treatment-resistant depression."}, {"Title": "A comparison of smoking behaviour characteristics between Caucasian smokers in the United Kingdom and Malay smokers in Malaysia.", "Abstract": "There is evidence that smoking behaviour differs by ethnicity.

The analysis of cortisol in hair is a recent methodological development that may increase the quality of long-term cortisol assessments in such research. Here, we use this method to closely assess hair cortisol relationships with trauma-related characteristics and PTSD symptom patterns.\nHair cortisol concentrations (HCC), diurnal salivary cortisol, and relevant psychometric data were assessed in matched groups of 28 PTSD patients and 27 traumatized and 32 nontraumatized healthy control subjects. Cortisol levels were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder patients and traumatized control subjects exhibited 59% and 51% lower HCC than nontraumatized control subjects, respectively. Hair cortisol concentrations were found to be negatively related to the severity of intrusion symptoms, the number of different lifetime traumatic events, the frequency of traumatization, and the time interval since traumatization. The overall pattern of HCC associations was not reflected in short-term salivary cortisol findings.\nOur results indicate that trauma exposure per se, either in the absence or presence of PTSD, is a crucial correlate of long-term basal cortisol levels. Particularly, the experience of multiple events with a longer time since traumatization and an increased severity of intrusion symptoms may be related to hypocortisolism. The fact that HCC findings were not consistently seen in salivary cortisol data underscores the importance of the method of cortisol assessment and highlights the utility of hair cortisol analyses for future biological psychiatry research."}, {"Title": "Decision making: from neuroscience to psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Adaptive behaviors increase the likelihood of survival and reproduction and improve the quality of life. However, it is often difficult to identify optimal behaviors in real life due to the complexity of the decision maker's environment and social dynamics. As a result, although many different brain areas and circuits are involved in decision making, evolutionary and learning solutions adopted by individual decision makers sometimes produce suboptimal outcomes. Although these problems are exacerbated in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, their underlying neurobiological causes remain incompletely understood. In this review, theoretical frameworks in economics and machine learning and their applications in recent behavioral and neurobiological studies are summarized. Examples of such applications in clinical domains are also discussed for substance abuse, Parkinson's disease, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and autism. Findings from these studies have begun to lay the foundations necessary to improve diagnostics and treatment for various neurological and psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Incidence and 12-month outcome of non-transient childhood conversion disorder in the U.K. and Ireland.", "Abstract": "Little is known about conversion disorder in childhood.\nTo document clinical incidence, features, management and 12-month outcome of non-transient conversion disorder in under 16-year-olds in the U.K. and Ireland.\nSurveillance through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Surveillance System.\nIn total, 204 cases (age range 7-15 years) were reported, giving a 12-month incidence of 1.30/100 000 (95% CI 1.11-1.52).

This creates a gap in research training at a critical developmental stage. In response, Columbia University Medical Center's Department of Psychiatry, in partnership with the New York State Psychiatric Institute, has created a formal Research Track Program (RTP) for psychiatry residents so that interested individuals can maintain their attention on research training during formative residency years. Clinical and research training are integrated through core clinical rotations on research units. With protected research time and clear developmental milestones for each year of training, the RTP allows research track residents to meet both clinical and research training goals while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. In coordination with existing postdoctoral research fellowship programs, research track residents can effectively jump-start fellowship training with advanced course work and consistent, continuous mentorship bridging residency and fellowship years. A key element of the program is its provision of core training in research literacy and extensive research opportunities for all residents, stimulating research interest across the whole residency program. Supported by the National Institutes of Health and a private foundation, this RTP capitalizes on a unique academic-private partnership to address many of the challenges facing physician-scientists. By integrating clinical and research exposures and offering protected research time, careful mentoring, and financial resources, the program aims to further the development of those most poised to establish careers in translational research."}, {"Title": "Personality subtypes in adolescents with anorexia nervosa.", "Abstract": "The aims of this study are to (1) empirically identify the personality subtypes of adolescents with anorexic disorders and (2) investigate the personality disorders, identity disturbances, and affective features associated with the different subtypes.

Her visual acuity was reduced to perception of hand motions, and she was agitated because of the loss of vision. The patient, who gave birth by cesarean section, was admitted for control examination 2 weeks after birth. No change was observed in premacular hemorrhage in control examination. However, the patient's relatives stated that the patient was very agitated and disinterested in her baby. For this reason, the patient was referred to the psychiatry clinic, and she was diagnosed with postpartum depression. The anatomical location of the premacular hemorrhage was determined by spectral domain optical coherence tomography.\nNeodymium yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser hyaloidotomy was performed to her left eye on the same day. Rapid release of premacular hemorrhage into the vitreous cavity was observed immediately after Nd:YAG laser application. Two days after the application, the patient's visual acuity had improved to 20/20.

A reply to Wijsbek.", "Abstract": "In a recent article, Henri Wijsbek discusses the 1991 Chabot \"psychiatric euthanasia\" case in the Netherlands, and argues that Chabot was justified in helping his patient to die. Dutch legislation at the time permitted physician assisted suicide when the patient's condition is severe, hopeless, and unbearable. The Dutch Supreme Court agreed with Chabot that the patient met these criteria because of her justified depression, even though she was somatically healthy. Wijsbek argues that in this case, the patient's integrity had been undermined by recent events, and that this is the basis for taking her request seriously; it was unreasonable to expect that she could start again. In this paper, I do not challenge the Dutch euthanasia criteria in the case of somatic illness, but I argue that both Chabot and Wijsbek are wrong because we can never be sufficiently confident in cases of severe exogenous depression to assist the patient in her irreversible act. This is partly because of the essential difference between somatic and mental illness, and because of the possibility of therapy and other help. In addition, I argue that Wijsbek's concept of integrity cannot do the work that he expects of it. Finally, I consider a 2011 position paper from the Royal Dutch Medical Association on euthanasia, and the implications it might have for Chabot-style cases in the future."}, {"Title": "A systematic review of telemedicine services for residents in long term care facilities.", "Abstract": "We conducted a systematic review of the literature on telemedicine use in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) and assessed the quality of the published evidence.

The clinical services provided by telemedicine included allied health (n = 5), dermatology (3), general practice (4), neurology (2), geriatrics (1), psychiatry (4) and multiple specialities (3). Most studies (17) employed real-time telemedicine using videoconferencing. The remaining five used store and forward telemedicine. The papers focused on economics (3), feasibility (9), stakeholder satisfaction (12), reliability (5) and service implementation (2). Overall, the quality of evidence for telemedicine in LTCFs was low. There was only one small randomised controlled trial (RCT). Most studies were observational and qualitative, and focused on utilisation. They were mainly based on surveys and interviews of stakeholders.

The 3' end of SLC1A1 is the only genomic region with consistently demonstrated OCD association, especially when analyzing male-only probands. However, specific allele associations have not been consistently replicated, and recent OCD genome-wide association and meta-analysis studies have not incorporated all previously associated SLC1A1 SNPs. To clarify the nature of association between SLC1A1 and OCD, pooled analysis was performed on all available relevant raw study data, comprising a final sample of 815 trios, 306 cases and 634 controls. This revealed weak association between OCD and one of nine tested SLC1A1 polymorphisms (rs301443; uncorrected P\u2009=\u20090.046; non-significant corrected P). Secondary analyses of male-affecteds only (N\u2009=\u2009358 trios and 133 cases) demonstrated modest association between OCD and a different SNP (rs12682807; uncorrected P\u2009=\u20090.012; non-significant corrected P). Findings of this meta-analysis are consistent with the trend of previous candidate gene studies in psychiatry and do not clarify the putative role of SLC1A1 in OCD pathophysiology.

Deinstitutionalisation, the normalization principle, advocacy, empowerment and the recovery model are ideologies that have been closely associated with policy, service developments and clinical practice in psychiatry. A \"new professionalism\" is emerging as a consequence of a number of changes in mental health care that needs to be guided by the highest standards of care which are best epitomized in psychiatry as a social contract with society. Looking to the future it is important that the profession recognises the impact ideology can make, if it is not to remain constantly on the defensive. In order to engage proactively and effectively with ideology as well as clinical science and evidence based service development, psychiatry as a profession will do best to approach significant future policy, practice and service changes by adopting an ethical approach, as a form a social contract. Psychiatrists must pay increasing attention to understanding values as expressed by ideologies, working in a collaborative way with other mental health professionals, involve service users and manage systems as well as be competent in clinical assessment and treatment. Whether in time of plenty or in times of deprivation, ideology produces effects on practice and in the context of constantly changing knowledge and the current financial stress this is likely to be more the case (and not less) in the foreseeable future. Psychiatrists must take into consideration the new social problems seen in some high income countries with the increased availability of highly potent \"street drugs\", perceived threats from various immigrant and minority communities and breakdown of \"social capital\" such as the decline of the nuclear family."}, {"Title": "Mood and anxiety disorders among inpatients of a university hospital in Turkey.", "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders among inpatients and the relationship between sociodemographic factors, medical illnesses and treatments.\nIn the present study, we selected 650 inpatients from all clinics except psychiatry and pediatrics in a general hospital by a simple random sampling method. Based on the exclusion criteria, 57 patients were excluded. Mood and anxiety disorders were determined by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition.\nOf the participants, 226 (37.5%) had a psychiatric disorder, 87 (14.4) had a mood disorder and 146 (24.2%) had an anxiety disorder. The most common specific diagnoses were not otherwise specified as anxiety disorder (9.5%), major depression (8.6%) and generalized anxiety disorder (7.6%). While the overall prevalence was highest in the hematology clinic (60.0%), it was lowest in the clinic of infectious diseases (22.7%). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the independent factors associated with psychiatric disorders were being of the female gender and a personal history of psychiatric disorders.\nIn conclusion, results of the present study suggest that mood and anxiety disorders were frequently observed among inpatients, particularly in female patients and those with an individual history of psychiatric disorder. Successful treatment of these disorders may positively contribute to the course of the disease in inpatients.

Four hundred eighty-three participants (283 with psychiatric illnesses and 200 with other medical illnesses) completed the SWLS and other self-report instruments. Results of the EFA and CFA supported the fit for the one-factor model as the best-fitting model. The internal consistency of the SWLS (\u03b1=0.86) was found to be high. Correlational analyses showed that SWLS had adequate concurrent validity. Scores on SWLS, which differentiated psychiatric patients and medical patients, supported criterion validity.

Special problems might be posed by patients with complicated features or ECT-indications other than treatment-refractory depression (TRD). Considering these patients there is a particular paucity of data, especially regarding anesthesiological aspects. Therefore, we sought (1) to discuss special issues of the peri-interventional management of non-TRD-cases from a combined psychiatric-anesthesiological point of view and (2) to assess the efficacy of ECT in the classical indication of TRD as compared to cases undergoing ECT for other indications or under difficult conditions (non-TRD) by means of Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale scores. A retrospective chart analysis of patients treated with ECT between the years 2009 and 2011 at the University of Ulm, Department of Psychiatry, was conducted. Special anesthesiological efforts were necessary in cohort non-TRD. There was no difference in the clinical outcome between cohort non-TRD (n=7) and TRD (n=22) with a median CGI-I score of 2 (\"much improved\") in both groups. Close cooperation between psychiatry and anesthesiology is indispensable in non-TRD patients. Our results provide preliminary evidence that ECT is equally effective in the standard indication of TRD compared to other indications."}, {"Title": "Implementing psychiatric day treatment for infants, toddlers, preschoolers and their families: a study from a clinical and organizational perspective.", "Abstract": "An increasing number of empirical studies indicate that infants, toddlers and preschoolers may suffer from non-transient mental illnesses featuring developmental psychopathology. A few innovative child psychiatric approaches have been developed to treat infants, toddlers and preschoolers and their families, but have not yet been conceptually presented and discussed in the framework of different healthcare systems. The organizational and clinical experience gained while developing specific approaches may be important across disciplines and guide future developments in psychiatric treatment of infants, toddlers, preschoolers and their families.\nThis article introduces the Preschool Family Day Hospital for Infants, Toddlers and Preschoolers and their Families at M\u00fcnster University Hospital, Germany. This hospital is unique in the German healthcare system with regard to its social-service institution division of labor. Specifically, it uses an intermittent treatment approach and an integrated interactional family psychiatric approach to treat children and their parents as separate patients. This multidisciplinary, developmentally and family-oriented approach includes components of group treatments with children and separate treatments with parents. Specific techniques include video-assisted treatments of the parent-child interaction, psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatments for parents, and conjoint family therapies that include both parents and siblings.\nThe Family Day Hospital for infants, toddlers and preschoolers and their families offers innovative family-oriented treatments for those who suffer from a wide range of severe child psychiatric disorders that cannot be sufficiently treated in outpatient settings. Treatment is based on the need for family-oriented approaches to the early psychiatric treatment of infants, toddlers and preschoolers.

We aimed to (1) investigate the degree of overlap among empirical definitions of wisdom, (2) identify the most commonly cited wisdom subcomponents, (3) examine the psychometric properties of existing assessment instruments, and (4) investigate whether certain assessment procedures work particularly well in tapping the essence of subcomponents of the various empirical definitions. We searched PsychINFO-indexed articles published through May 2012 and their bibliographies. Studies were included if they were published in a peer-reviewed journal and (1) proposed a definition of wisdom or (2) discussed the development or validation of an instrument designed to assess wisdom. Thirty-one articles met inclusion criteria. Despite variability among the 24 reviewed definitions, there was significant overlap. Commonly cited subcomponents of wisdom included knowledge of life, prosocial values, self-understanding, acknowledgment of uncertainty, emotional homeostasis, tolerance, openness, spirituality, and sense of humor. Published reports describing the psychometric properties of nine instruments varied in comprehensiveness but most measures were examined for selected types of reliability and validity, which were generally acceptable. Given limitations of self-report procedures, an approach integrating multiple indices (e.g., self-report and performance-based measures) may better capture wisdom. Significant progress in the empirical study of wisdom has occurred over the past four decades; however, much needs to be done. Future studies with larger, more diverse samples are needed to determine the generalizability, usefulness, and clinical applicability of these definitions and assessment instruments.

Anosognosia has far-reaching consequences for diagnosis and treatment and is probably associated with unfavorable prognosis. This study examined the relationship between anosognosia and depression in patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Assessment included interviews of patients and their caregivers. Depressive symptoms were evaluated with observer and self-rating instruments: the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the \"mood\" subscale of the Nurses Observation Scale for geriatric patients (NOSGER). Anosognosia was evaluated with the Anosognosia Questionnaire for Dementia (AQ-D). For the evaluation of behavioral and neuropsychological symptoms in dementia and the caregiver burden, the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) and the Cares of older People in Europe (COPE) Index were administered. A total of 47 patients were enrolled in the study at the department's geriatric psychiatry outpatient clinic. A considerable discrepancy was found between observer- and self-ratings of depressive symptoms. In 74.5% of the participants, caregiver ratings indicated secondary symptoms of depression as opposed to patient ratings. Thus, in AD, anosognosia may affect not only deficits in cognition and everyday functioning but also affective symptoms (\"affective anosognosia\"). Caregiver rating therefore is particularly important when assessing mood changes in AD patients."}, {"Title": "[Differences in attachment and personality in children from child guidance centers, child psychiatry units, and control families].", "Abstract": "Insecure attachment and deficits in self-regulation as personality traits are risk factors for the development of psychopathological symptoms from infancy on. This study examines differences in attachment and personality in late childhood, comparing children from non-clinical families, from a child guidance center, and child psychiatry units with in-patient care. Children's attachment representations, their attachment behavior strategy, reported distressing parental behavior, their emotional openness, and attachment coherency were assessed with the Late Childhood Attachment Interview (LCAI). Ego-resiliency, ego-undercontrol, field-independence, aggressiveness, and anxiety were assessed by means of the California Child Q-Sort. The results show clear attachment differences, with the child guidance group showing more attachment insecurity in the LCAI compared to the control group, and the psychiatric in-patient group even more attachment insecurity, more distressing parenting from both mother and father, and more attachment disorganization than the other two groups. Whereas children from the child guidance center and the child psychiatry unit did not differ in personality, both groups were significantly different from the control group in all personality dimensions. The results suggest that personality differences may be a risk factor for behaviour problems, however problem severity and the choice of the treatment institution seem to be influenced by attachment security."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatric and psychosomatic consulation-liaison.

The most important indications were aggression, agitation and sleep problems. If the term &lsquo;off-label&rsquo; is interpreted in a broader sense with respect to antipsychotics for psychosis and hypomania, then 33% of the prescriptions appeared to be off-label. If benzodiazepines prescribed for aggression/agitation were not taken into account, then the proportion of off-label prescriptions decreased to 21%.\nWe consider it advisable that the reason for prescribing off-label medication should be clearly documented.

An analysis of time-relevant discourse taken from 59 in-depth interviews with patients and their workers is provided to show regularities and discontinuities in schedules of post-discharge supervision in community living. Regularities included timed phases for achieving discretionary permission for greater liberty from services. Discontinuities indicate mismatches between hospital and community time and patient and professional time. Benchmarking by patients is an important resource and allows comparisons and measurements of stages in the discharge process. The discharged patients showed awareness of deviance and implicated time as an important resource in claiming ordinary identities. The participants produced progressive stories to show their incremental movement towards recovery and, ultimately, establish their non-deviant identities. The workers use time as just one part of a complex display of professional judgement of continued risk status. Fixed periods of elapsed time are necessary but not sufficient criteria for workers to reduce surveillance. Time remains a useful resource for patients to chart their way towards more routine identities."}, {"Title": "[Becoming a psychiatric nurse in a prison].", "Abstract": "What motivates a young professional to work in psychiatry in a prison?

This review aims to present the available evidence on alternatives to conventional hospitalisation for medical disorders; options for surgery, psychiatry and palliative care are largely excluded.\nNarrative review.\nThe main alternatives to conventional hospitalisation include day centres (DC), quick diagnosis units (QDU), hospital at home (HaH) and, in some circumstances, telemonitoring. DC increase patient comfort, reduce costs and can improve efficiency. In generally healthy patients with suspected severe disease, QDU may be a good alternative to hospitalisation for diagnostic procedures. However, their cost-effectiveness remains to be clearly proven. Randomised controlled trials have shown that hospital-at-home (HaH) can lead to earlier hospital discharges, improve outcomes and reduce costs in patients with prevalent chronic diseases. Although telemonitoring seems to be promising and its use is increasing, methodologically sounder studies with a higher level of evidence are needed to assess its clinical effectiveness.\nFactors such as ageing, the need for an earlier diagnosis of suspected severe disease, the increasing complexity of medical care and the increasing costs of hospitalisation mean that, whenever possible, giving priority to less expensive alternatives to hospital admission, such as QDU, DC, HaH and telemedicine, is an urgent task in the current economic crisis."}, {"Title": "Concordance: a concept analysis.", "Abstract": "To report an analysis of the concept of concordance.\nAdherence-based medicines interventions are known to be of limited success.

Rivastigmine treatment was started orally in 54.4% of the patients and transdermally in 45.6%; 35.6% of those who started treatment by the OR route switched to TDR. A single dose adjustment was sufficient for 77.5% of patients on TDR treatment vs 11.8% of patients receiving OR treatment. More patients on TDR treatment (80.8% vs. 57.1% on OR treatment) reached the maximum therapeutic dose of rivastigmine and did so in a shorter period of time (51.6 vs 205.8 days). Compliance rates (60.5% vs 47.2%) and caregivers' satisfaction with treatment (89.4% vs 81.9%) were also higher for TDR.\nIn normal clinical practice, using the TDR route of administration improves dose titration and drug compliance, allowing more patients to reach the maximum recommended dose of rivastigmine in a shorter time period."}, {"Title": "Behind the scenes of a research and training collaboration: power, privilege, and the hidden transcript of race.", "Abstract": "This paper examines a federally funded research and training collaboration between an Ivy League psychiatric research center and a historically Black university and medical center. This collaboration focuses on issues of psychiatric recovery and rehabilitation among African Americans. In addition, this multidisciplinary collaboration aims to build the research capacity at both institutions and to contribute to the tradition of research in culture and mental health within the medical social sciences and cultural psychiatry. This article provides a window into the complex, often messy, dynamics of a collaboration that cross cuts institutional, disciplinary, and demographic boundaries. Taking an auto-ethnographic approach, we intend to illustrate how collaborative relationships unfold and are constructed through ongoing reciprocal flows of knowledge and experience. Central to this aim is a consideration of how issues of power, privilege, and the hidden transcript of race shape the nature of our research and training efforts."}, {"Title": "Application of functional near-infrared spectroscopy in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Two decades ago, the introduction of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) into the field of neuroscience created new opportunities for investigating neural processes within the human cerebral cortex. Since then, fNIRS has been increasingly used to conduct functional activation studies in different neuropsychiatric disorders, most prominently schizophrenic illnesses, affective disorders and developmental syndromes, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder as well as normal and pathological aging. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of state of the art fNIRS research in psychiatry covering a wide range of applications, including studies on the phenomenological characterization of psychiatric disorders, descriptions of life-time developmental aspects, treatment effects, and genetic influences on neuroimaging data. Finally, methodological shortcomings as well as current research perspectives and promising future applications of fNIRS in psychiatry are discussed. We conclude that fNIRS is a valid addition to the range of neuroscientific methods available to assess neural mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders. Future research should particularly focus on expanding the presently used activation paradigms and cortical regions of interest, while additionally fostering technical and methodological advances particularly concerning the identification and removal of extracranial influences on fNIRS data as well as systematic artifact correction. Eventually, fNIRS might be a useful tool in practical psychiatric settings involving both diagnostics and the complementary treatment of psychological disorders using, for example, neurofeedback applications."}, {"Title": "[Social space and support of people with chronic mental illness].", "Abstract": "This article deals with the conceptional meaning of social space orientation in the field of community psychiatry.

Biomarkers such as concentration of cotinine in the blood, urine, or saliva have been used as objective measures to distinguish nonusers and users of tobacco products. A change in the cut-off value of urinary cotinine to detect active tobacco use is associated with a change in sensitivity and sensitivity of detection.\nThe current study aimed at assessing the impact of using different cut-off thresholds of urinary cotinine on sensitivity and specificity of detection of smoking and smokeless tobacco product use among psychiatric patients.\nAll the male subjects attending the psychiatry out-patient department of the tertiary care multispecialty teaching hospital constituted the sample frame for the current study in a cross-sectionally.\nQuantitative urinary cotinine assay was done by using ELISA kits of Calbiotech.

We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to assess the sensitivity and specificity of various cut-off values of urinary cotinine to identify active smokers and users of smokeless tobacco products.\nROC analysis of urinary cotinine levels in detection of self-reported smoking provided the area under curve (AUC) of 0.434. Similarly, the ROC analysis of urinary cotinine levels in detection of self-reported smoking revealed AUC of 0.44. The highest sensitivity and specificity of 100% for smoking were detected at the urinary cut-off value greater than or equal to 2.47 ng/ml.\nThe choice of cut-off value of urinary cotinine used to distinguish nonusers form active users of tobacco products impacts the sensitivity as well as specificity of detection."}, {"Title": "You can't spell schizophrenia without an 'I': how does the early intervention in psychosis approach relate to the concept of schizophrenia as an ipseity disturbance?", "Abstract": "Operational approaches to psychiatric diagnosis have increased reliability, but the cost has been the reduction of diagnostic concepts to tick-box lists of objective symptoms. Some blame this for growing disillusionment among younger clinicians in mental health. A renewed emphasis on the human subject and subjective experience could be one way to remedy this. While true for psychiatry in general, it is particularly true in psychiatry's 'sacred symbol' of psychiatry, schizophrenia. Greater understanding of schizophrenia will be of most relevance to those who have yet to develop the disorder, such as those targeted by Early Intervention in Psychosis services. A promising direction in the understanding of schizophrenia is the notion of fundamental disturbance in the sense of self ('ipseity disturbance').\nI intend to examine the relationship between the concept of schizophrenia as an ipseity disturbance and the Early Intervention in Psychosis service model through consideration of three main areas: symptoms of schizophrenia as understood by the ipseity disturbance concept; implications of the ipseity disturbance concept for the notion of a schizophrenia prodrome; and the ways in which the Early Intervention in Psychosis service model reflects or could be informed by the ipseity disturbance concept.\nI argue that explicit consideration of schizophrenia as an ipseity disturbance could lead to better identification of those at highest risk, and more appropriately tailored interventions."}, {"Title": "Discourses of collaborative failure: identity, role and discourse in an interdisciplinary world.", "Abstract": "Discourses of interdisciplinary health-care are becoming more centralised in the context of global healthcare practices, which are increasingly based on multisystem interventions. As with all dominant discourses that are narrated into being, many others have been silenced and decentralised in the process. While questions of the nature and constituents of interdisciplinary practices continue to be debated and rehearsed, this paper focuses on the discourse of interdisciplinary collaboration using psychiatry as an example, with the aim of highlighting competing and alternative discourses. The fundamental premise of this paper is that collaborative relationships form the basis of interdisciplinary practices in psychiatry. Through a critical engagement and a deconstructive reading of the pretext, context and subtexts of interdisciplinarity, we interrogate the concept of interdisciplinary practice within psychiatry. We contend that an important part of understanding and further conceptualising the discourse is through fracturing it. This process is illustrated in the successive stages of our conceptual map of discourse development: establishing, maintaining and developing discourses. An understanding of interdisciplinary practice is not only critical for psychiatry, but also offers important insights into the performance of collaborative failures and indeed successes across nursing and allied health professions."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of the Time to Change programme in England 2008-2011.", "Abstract": "Time to Change (TTC) is the largest-ever programme in England designed to reduce stigma and discrimination against people with mental health disorders.

Epigenetic modifications, functionally relevant changes to gene expression that do not reflect changes in gene sequence, may explain how environmental exposures 'get under the skin' to modify the expression of genes and produce phenotypic variability. The potential of epigenetic research to unify two disparate strands of inquiry has contributed to substantial, and growing, interest in epigenetics in mental health research. However, there are several challenges with which investigators must contend in studies considering the role of epigenetic modifications in psychopathology. These include the development of causal models in study design, considerations about sample size and generalisability, and robust measurement of epigenetic modification. We employ an epidemiological lens to discuss these challenges and to provide recommendations for future studies in this area."}, {"Title": "Developmental regression, depression, and psychosocial stress in an adolescent with Down syndrome.", "Abstract": "Kristen is a 13-year-old girl with Down syndrome (DS) who was seen urgently with concerns of cognitive and developmental regression including loss of language, social, and toileting skills. The evaluation in the DS clinic focused on potential medical diagnoses including atlantoaxial joint instability, vitamin deficiency, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and seizures. A comprehensive medical evaluation yielded only a finding of moderate OSA. A reactive depression was considered in association with several psychosocial factors including moving homes, entering puberty/onset of menses, and classroom change from an integrated setting to a self-contained classroom comprising unfamiliar peers with behavior challenges.Urgent referrals for psychological and psychiatric evaluations were initiated. Neuropsychological testing did not suggest true regression in cognitive, language, and academic skills, although decreases in motivation and performance were noted with a reaction to stress and multiple environmental changes as a potential causative factor. Psychiatry consultation supported this finding in that psychosocial stress temporally correlated with Kristen's regression in skills.Working collaboratively, the team determined that Kristen's presentation was consistent with a reactive form of depression (DSM-IV-TR: depressive disorder, not otherwise specified). Kristen's presentation was exacerbated by salient environmental stress and sleep apnea, rather than a cognitive regression associated with a medical cause. Treatment consisted of an antidepressant medication, continuous positive airway pressure for OSA, and increased psychosocial supports. Her school initiated a change in classroom placement.

Each program director or administrator was asked to voluntarily distribute the survey to his or her trainees. Chi-squared tests were performed to test differences in proportions. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression was used to model outcomes of interest.\nIn total, 283 respondents completed the survey. A majority of respondents were interested in telepsychiatry and felt that it was an important part of training. Of the 50 respondents who had clinical exposure to telepsychiatry and completed the survey, most reported that their experience increased their interest level, and two-thirds reported having either a one-time encounter or less than 6\u2009h of multiple patient experiences via telepsychiatry. Clinical exposure to telepsychiatry was significantly related to level of training (p=0.001) and program location (p=0.005).

We assessed the effects of withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure, and subsequent administration of fluoxetine (Prozac\u00ae), buspirone (Buspar\u00ae), and diazepam (Valium) using two behavioral paradigms; the Novel Tank Diving Test and the Light/Dark Choice Assay. A video tracking system was developed using two Apple\u00ae applications (Apps) to quantify these behaviors. Data from zebrafish exposed to the above treatments are presented in this paper not only to exemplify behavioral alterations associated with chronic exposure, but also more importantly, to validate the video tracking system. Following withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure, zebrafish exhibited dose/time-dependent anxiogenic effects; including reduced exploration and freezing behavior in the Novel Tank Diving Test, and preference for the dark area for the Light/Dark Choice Assay. In contrast, the above drug treatments had significant anxiolytic effects. We have developed a simple and cost-effective method of measuring zebrafish behavioral responses. The iPhone\u00ae Apps outlined in this study offer numerous flexible methods of data acquisition; namely, ease of identification and tracking of multiple animals, tools for visualization of the tracks, and calculation of a range of analysis parameters.

A clinical staging model predicts that in earlier stages of illness, symptom expression is both non-specific and diffuse. With illness progression, more specific syndromes emerge. This paper addressed the hypothesis that connection strength and connection variability between mental states differ in the hypothesized direction across different stages of psychopathology.\nIn a general population sample of female siblings (mostly twins), the Experience Sampling Method was used to collect repeated measures of three momentary mental states (positive affect, negative affect and paranoia). Staging was operationalized across four levels of increasing severity of psychopathology, based on the total score of the Symptom Check List. Multilevel random regression was used to calculate inter- and intra-mental state connection strength and connection variability over time by modelling each momentary mental state at t as a function of the three momentary states at t-1, and by examining moderation by SCL-severity.\nMental states impacted dynamically on each other over time, in interaction with SCL-severity groups. Thus, SCL-90 severity groups were characterized by progressively greater inter- and intra-mental state connection strength, and greater inter- and intra-mental state connection variability.\nDiagnosis in psychiatry can be described as stages of growing dynamic causal impact of mental states over time. This system achieves a mode of psychiatric diagnosis that combines nomothetic (group-based classification across stages) and idiographic (individual-specific psychopathological profiles) components of psychopathology at the level of momentary mental states impacting on each other over time."}, {"Title": "Rumination and impaired cortisol recovery following a social stressor in adolescent depression.", "Abstract": "Response styles theory promotes rumination as a central cognitive construct driving negative mood and depression, and past research suggests that at least part of the mechanism driving rumination's depressogenic effect is through inhibiting the individual's ability to shift attentional focus away from negative environmental stimuli.

In a community sample of depressed (n\u2009=\u200931) and non-depressed (n\u2009=\u200933) adolescents we assessed rumination and the more adaptive trait of distraction and problem-solving with the Children's Response Styles Questionnaire (CRSQ; Abela 2000), and diagnostic status was confirmed using the Child and Adolescent Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS; Kaufman et al.

Consistent with the predictions of response style theory, among the depressed adolescents only, high trait rumination was associated with delayed post-stressor cortisol recovery, whereas high trait distraction and problem-solving was associated with more rapid recovery. In contrast, response styles were not associated with cortisol recovery in the non-depressed group. These findings implicate impaired post-stress cortisol recovery as a potential mechanism underlying the pathological effect of rumination on the development and maintenance of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)."}, {"Title": "Access to subspecialty care for patients with mobility impairment: a survey.", "Abstract": "Adults who use wheelchairs have difficulty accessing physicians and receive less preventive care than their able-bodied counterparts.\nTo learn about the accessibility of medical and surgical subspecialist practices for patients with mobility impairment.\nA telephone survey was used to try to make an appointment for a fictional patient who was obese and hemiparetic, used a wheelchair, and could not self-transfer from chair to examination table.\n256 endocrinology, gynecology, orthopedic surgery, rheumatology, urology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and psychiatry practices in 4 U.S. cities.\nNone.\nAccessibility of the practice, reasons for lack of accessibility, and planned method of transfer of the patient to an examination table.\nOf 256 practices, 56 (22%) reported that they could not accommodate the patient, 9 (4%) reported that the building was inaccessible, 47 (18%) reported inability to transfer a patient from a wheelchair to an examination table, and 22 (9%) reported use of height-adjustable tables or a lift for transfer.

We hypothesize that hypernatraemic events that occur in DI predict decreased renal function in elderly patients on lithium.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study involving 55 geriatric psychiatry patients using lithium between 1985 and 2010. Patients who always had sodium levels \u2264146\u2009mmol/L were compared to patients with one or more episodes of hypernatraemia (serum sodium level \u2265147\u2009mmol/L) for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels and prevalence of severe chronic renal failure (eGFR \u226430\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m(2)).\neGFR was found to be less in the hypernatraemic group than in the non-hypernatraemic controls (41 vs 56\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m(2); P = 0.0074). Severe chronic renal failure appeared more prevalent in hypernatraemic patients (4/14 (28.6%) vs. 3/41 (7.3%)), but this did not achieve statistical significance (P = 0.061). The two groups did not differ for age, sex, medical comorbidities or other clinical variables, except antidepressant use. Hypernatraemic patients appeared less likely to use antidepressants than non-hypernatraemic patients, odds ratio = 0.69 (P = 0.020). However, in multivariate analysis, hypernatraemia correlated with decreased eGFR (\u03b2 = -0.39, P = 0.004), while antidepressant use did not (P = 0.81).\nThese results suggest that hypernatraemic events may predict reduced renal function in geriatric patients using lithium. The role of hypernatraemia and DI in renal failure in this population requires further study. Health professionals should be aware of the risks of renal failure in older patients treated with lithium, especially in the context of sodium level abnormalities."}, {"Title": "Evolution of the psychological autopsy: fifty years of experience at the Los Angeles County Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner's Office.", "Abstract": "The origin of the psychological autopsy was in the late 1950s and the result of a collaboration between the Los Angeles County Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner's Office and the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center. It was conceptualized as a thorough retrospective analysis of the decedent's state of mind and intention at the time of death. It was used initially in \"equivocal\" deaths where the manner of death was possibly either suicide or accident. Later, it was used in cases where a party (primarily family members) protested the Medical Examiner-Coroner's suicide determination.

The disorders include antibody-associated limbic encephalitis and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis; however, seizures of autoimmune etiology may exist beyond the spectrum of these recognized syndromes. Because these seizures are potentially treatable with immune therapy, guidelines are needed to help in their early recognition.\nWe describe 13 representative children seen at our tertiary institution over a period of 3.5 years with suspected autoimmune epilepsy. Autoimmune epilepsy was suspected clinically when there was any of the following: (1) recognizable syndromes such as NMDAR encephalitis or limbic encephalitis, (2) evidence of CNS inflammation in cerebrospinal fluid or on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (3) the presence of other autoimmune diseases, or (4) positive response to immunotherapy. We tested these patients for neuronal surface antibodies (voltage gated potassium channel [VGKC]-complex, leucine rich glioma inactivated 1 [LGI1], contactin-associated protein-like 2 [CASPR2], and NMDAR) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. We modified the J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry, 83, 2012, 638 guidelines that were designed to classify adults with neuronal surface antibody syndromes (NSAS), to be more appropriate for children with suspected autoimmune epilepsy. Using the modified guidelines, the 13 patients were classified into definite, probable, possible, unlikely, or unknown autoimmune epilepsy according to the presence of neuronal surface or GAD antibodies, and the response to immune therapy when given.\nOf the 13 patients, 11 were females, and the mean age was 6 years (range 1-13 years). Three patients had classical NMDAR encephalitis, two had VGKC encephalitis, two had limbic encephalitis with negative antibodies, three had epilepsy with other autoimmune diseases (one with high titer GAD antibodies), two had fever-induced refractory epileptic encephalopathy in school-aged children (FIRES), and one epileptic encephalopathy associated with VGKC antibodies. Seven patients of the 13 children with suspected autoimmune epilepsy were positive for neuronal surface antibodies (NMDAR, n = 3; VGKC-complex, n = 3; and GAD, n = 1). Immunotherapy was given to nine cases, and a positive response was more common in patients with positive neuronal surface antibodies (5/5) compared to those with negative antibodies (2/4). Applying the proposed guidelines, the classification of autoimmune epilepsy was definite in five, probable in one, possible in three, unlikely in two, and unknown in two patients.\nNeuronal surface antibodies and GAD antibodies are present in a proportion of children with suspected autoimmune epilepsy and may define a treatable subgroup of childhood epilepsy. The proposed guidelines can be useful in the recognition of children with seizures of autoimmune etiology."}, {"Title": "Clinical staging in psychiatry: a cross-cutting model of diagnosis with heuristic and practical value.", "Abstract": "Staging models are used routinely in general medicine for potentially serious or chronic physical disorders such as diabetes, arthritis and cancers, describing the links between biomarkers, clinical phenotypes and disease extension, and promoting a personalised or stratified medicine approach to treatment planning. Clinical staging involves a detailed description of where an individual exists on a continuum of disorder progression from stage 0 (an at-risk or latency stage) through to stage IV (late or end-stage disease). The approach is popular owing to its clinical utility and is increasingly being applied in psychiatry. The concept offers an informed approach to research and the active promotion of indicated prevention and early intervention strategies. We suggest that for young persons with emerging bipolar disorder, such transdiagnostic staging models could provide a framework that better reflects the developmental psychopathology and matches the complex longitudinal inter-relationships between subsyndromal and syndromal mood, psychotic and other disorders."}, {"Title": "A diversity of voices: the McGill 'Working with Culture' seminars.", "Abstract": "The Working with Culture seminar is offered as a course during the month long Annual McGill Summer Program for Social and Transcultural Psychiatry, attended by local and international participants each May since 1994.

The course readings, seminar topics and invited speakers focus mainly on therapist client encounters constructed by the multiple voices with dimensions of psychiatric, social, historical, legal, ethical, political, systemic and intra-psychic domains. The dual leadership emphasizes the gaps and complementarity amongst voices, and it invites and supports a destabilizing decentering process and the creation of solidarities amongst participants. Applying a bio-psychosocial case study method, each 3-h seminar engages the participants in a critical dialogue on apprehending the enmeshment of social suffering with psychiatric disorders whilst examining the usefulness and the limits of cultural formulation models.

If left unacknowledged, such unspoken and unconscious influences have the capacity to torpedo the interaction; if subjected to critical reflection, however, they can yield insights of great interpretive value and practical significance. Taking these reflections on counter-transference as point of departure, this article explores how a range of unacknowledged assumptions can torpedo good faith efforts to engender \"cultural sensitivity\" in a required course for American psychiatry residents. The course examined in this paper has been taught for seven successive years by a pair of attending psychiatrists at a longstanding New England residency training program. Despite the instructors' good intentions and ongoing experimentation with content and format, the course has failed repeatedly to meet either residents' expectations or, as the instructors bravely acknowledged, their own. The paper draws upon a year-long ethnographic study, conducted in the late 2000s during the most recent iteration of the course, which involved observation of course sessions, a series of interviews with course instructors, and pre- and post-course interviews with the majority of participating residents. By examining the dynamics of the course from the perspectives of both clinician-instructors and resident-students, the paper illuminates how classroom-based engagement with the clinical implications of culture and difference can run awry when the emotional potency of these issues is not adequately taken into account."}, {"Title": "Female same gender stalking: a brief review of the literature and case report.", "Abstract": "The authors analyze a rare case of female same gender stalking that came to their observation as forensic psychiatry experts. Despite previously only heterosexual experiences, the woman, who was 30 in 2002, had three intimate same gender relationships in succession from 2002 to 2009: she broke off with each woman in order to take up with another. When she separated from the third woman she began violent persecutory behavior against her, in the form of harassment coming under the heading of stalking, and was reported to the authorities. In treatment with SSRI since 2003 for an anxiety disorder with panic episodes, she had been taking the drugs irregularly during the stalking period. At the end of the third relationship, after she had violently attacked her girlfriend she was advised by her family to present to a Hospital center in Northern Italy. There, she was diagnosed with a \"Narcissistic Paranoid Personality Disorder\", and it was hypothesized that the SSRI she was taking could have induced hypo/manic episodes and disinhibition in the woman, who had previously been heterosexual. At this hospital, mood stabilizers were prescribed. The defending lawyer therefore applied for a forensic psychiatry assessment, claiming that the persecutory behavior against the third girlfriend was induced by taking SSRI. In Italy the penal code specifies the recognition of abolished or diminished liability for crimes if a correlation between the mental disease and the crime can be demonstrated, if the disease was in course at the time of the crime, and if the motives behind the crime and the disease can be shown to be linked. In short, if the crime can be shown to be a symptom of the disease. But the forensic psychiatry assessment demonstrated that despite the presence of some factors of a psychopathological nature, the motives underlying the harassment were attributable to the woman's existential history and personality structure rather than to psychopathological causes. She was therefore judged guilty of the crime of stalking and a plea for a reduced sentence was granted. In this case, the gender of the stalker and victim seemed to be irrelevant."}, {"Title": "Clinical application of brain imaging for the diagnosis of mood disorders: the current state of play.", "Abstract": "In response to queries about whether brain imaging technology has reached the point where it is useful for making a clinical diagnosis and for helping to guide treatment selection, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) has recently written a position paper on the Clinical Application of Brain Imaging in Psychiatry.

The field of nanotechnology opened new unsuspected fields of research a few years ago.\nTo provide an overview of nanotechnology application areas that could affect care for psychiatric illnesses.\nWe conducted a systematic review using the PRISMA criteria (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis). Inclusion criteria were specified in advance: all studies describing the development of nanotechnology in psychiatry. The research paradigm was: \"(nanotechnology OR nanoparticles OR nanomedicine) AND (central nervous system)\" Articles were identified in three research bases, Medline (1966-present), Web of Science (1975-present) and Cochrane (all articles). The last search was carried out on April 2, 2012. Seventy-six items were included in this qualitative review.\nThe main applications of nanotechnology in psychiatry are (i) pharmacology. There are two main difficulties in neuropharmacology. Drugs have to pass the blood brain barrier and then to be internalized by targeted cells. Nanoparticles could increase drugs' bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, especially improving safety and efficacy of psychotropic drugs. Liposomes, nanosomes, nanoparticle polymers, nanobubbles are some examples of this targeted drug delivery. Nanotechnologies could also add new pharmacological properties, like nanohells and dendrimers; (ii) living analysis. Nanotechnology provides technical assistance to in vivo imaging or metabolome analysis; (iii) central nervous system modeling. Research teams have modelized inorganic synapses and mimicked synaptic behavior, essential for further creation of artificial neural systems. Some nanoparticle assemblies present the same small world and free-scale network architecture as cortical neural networks. Nanotechnologies and quantum physics could be used to create models of artificial intelligence and mental illnesses.\nEven if nanotechnologies are promising, their safety is still tricky and this must be kept in mind.\nWe are not about to see a concrete application of nanomedicine in daily psychiatric practice.

Drug-induced pancreatitis has been described since 1955. It may be induced by more than 260\u00a0various molecules, as well as by valproic acid, which remains underreported in the literature because there is a problem of imputability.\nThe prevalence of acute drug-induced pancreatitis is set between 1\u00a0and 2\u00a0%. However, it must remain as an exclusion diagnosis after conducting an exhaustive etiological investigation that will, notably, eliminate bilary and alcoholic causes. The most incriminated drugs are the inhibitors of the conversion enzyme, sulfa drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, diuretics and anticonvulsants, including valproic acid. In Tunisia, the prescription of valproic acid is increasing in bipolar disorder therapy because it is known for its weak toxicity and easy handling.\nThe case of our patient, who suffers from an acute Balthazar stage C pancreatitis with severe evolution after the drug was stopped, the imputability of valproic acid was considered strong and the collegial decision between the surgery, pharmacovigilance and psychiatry services maintained the drug-induced origin and consequently stopped the valproic acid.\nThis case supports the idea that acute pancreatitis may be induced by valproic acid, even after a prescription lasting for a long period of time, it has no predictable factors and is totally independent of the drug-related dose and of depakine blood levels. There are no predictive factors to the present day, but the evolution is generally good except in rare cases where it may be dangerous.

However, this assertion has received only few direct arguments to date, and there is in fact a lack of knowledge on this subject. The aim of this study was to compare trait-anxiety - which is considered as a sensitive and early indicator of psychoaffective difficulties in children - in intellectually gifted children to the norm.\nOne hundred and eleven children aged 8 to 12 and with an intellectual quotient (IQ) higher than 129 participated in the study. They were recruited in a hospital department of child and adolescent psychiatry and through psychologists' private practice, where they attended consultation because of academic underachievement and/or social maladjustment. All the children were examined by trained psychiatrists and psychologists: none had a present or past medical or psychiatric condition and, additionally, none had an elevated score on the French version of the Children's Depressive Rating Scale Revised (Moor & Mack, 1982). Parents filled in a questionnaire for the collection of socio-demographic data and children answered the French version of the Revised-Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (R-CMAS; Reynolds, 1999), a 37-items self-assessment of trait-anxiety, the psychometric properties of which have been validated in children with high IQ.\nMean scores and subscores on the R-CMAS in the whole studied group and as a function of gender and age were compared to French normative data (Reynolds, 1999) by calculation of 95% confidence intervals; subgroups were compared using Student's t-tests. Proportions of children who's score and subscores exceeded anxiety cut-off norms were compared to normative data using chi-square tests. Statistical significance was considered at the P<0.05 level.\nThe studied group comprised mainly boys, and members of a sibling. Parents mainly lived as man and wife, had high academic levels, and had a professional activity. The confidence intervals of the R-CMAS scores and subscores all comprised their normative value, which denotes that no difference was statistically significant. Comparisons for age and gender showed no significant difference. Proportions of results exceeding the cut-off scores and subscores did not significantly differ from the norms.\nGeneral and dimensional trait-anxiety levels in the studied group were comparable to normative data. These results are in accordance with previous studies of trait-anxiety in children and adolescents with high IQ, which all showed normal or decreased levels. These findings do not corroborate the hypothesis that intellectual giftedness constitutes a risk factor for psychopathology.\nThe studied group was a clinical one, which could limit the generalisation of the results. However, mental disorders were ruled out, and the psychometric and socio-demographic characteristics of the group were in keeping with those described for the general population of gifted children. Moreover, considering that participant children displayed academic underachievement and/or social maladjustment, it can be supposed that their anxiety levels were not lower than those in the general population of gifted children. Secondly, the potentially confusing effect of socio-demographic variables (underrepresentation of low socio-economic levels and single-parent families) could not be statistically taken into account, due to the absence of a specific control group.\nIntellectually gifted children seem not to display increased trait-anxiety.

In order to improve compliance, reduce the frequency of taking medications and minimize the peaks and troughs associated with certain immediate-release formulations, pharmaceutical companies have developed a number of novel methods of delivering oral solid dosage medications in the form of controlled-release (CR) formulations. Some CR formulations have been associated with pharmacobezoars and false-positive findings on certain physical investigations. Though CR drugs are commonly used in psychiatry, clinicians appear to have a limited understanding of how they are released for absorption once ingested. Some have insoluble parts that are excreted in faeces as 'ghost pills'. Due to lack of awareness of this phenomenon to both patients and the physicians, anxiety has ensued in some patients. Some clinicians have been puzzled or have been dismissive when faced with curious patients wanting to know more after they had observed tablet-like looking structures in faeces. We present two cases from our clinical setting and a few drawn from the World Wide Web to highlight the role of CR medications and their association with the ghost pill phenomenon. The mechanisms involved in drug release relevant to psychiatry medications are also briefly reviewed. The ghost pill phenomenon occurs with certain CR medications. This is a normal and expected outcome related to drug-release mechanisms of some of these products. It is inevitable that some patients will see what looks like tablets or capsules in faeces.

The numbers of subsequent visits to the pediatric and psychiatry departments with anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other externalizing behavior diagnoses were compared over 15 years to a control sample that received only standard care. Parents positively reviewed the program and boys who received the intervention had fewer visits with psychiatric diagnoses. Analyses revealed an interaction effect, where boys with harder-to-manage temperaments saw a greater reduction in visits from the intervention. By sensitizing parents to their child's temperament and helping parents understand and manage temperament-related behaviors, anticipatory guidance can encourage a positive parent-child relationship and reduce future occurrences of psychiatric diagnoses."}, {"Title": "Use of electronic medical records differs by specialty and office settings.", "Abstract": "To assess differences in the use of electronic medical records (EMRs) among medical specialties and practice settings.\nA cross-sectional retrospective study using nationally representative data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for the period 2003-2010 was performed. Bivariate and multivariate analyzes compared EMR use among physicians of 14 specialties and assessed variation by practice setting. Differences in EMR use by geographic region, patient characteristics, and physician office settings were also assessed.\nBivariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated increased EMR use from 2003 to 2010, with 16% reporting at least partial use in 2003, rising to 52% in 2010 (p<0.001). Cardiologists, orthopedic surgeons, urologists, and family/general practitioners had higher frequencies of EMR use whereas psychiatrists, ophthalmologists, and dermatologists had the lowest EMR use. Employed physicians had higher EMR uptake than physicians who owned their practice (48% vs 31%, p<0.001). EMR uptake was lower among solo practitioners (23%) than non-solo practitioners (42%, p<0.001). Practices owned by Health Maintenance Organizations had higher frequencies of EMR use (83%) than practices owned by physicians, community health centers, or academic centers (all <45%, p<0.001). Patient demographics did not affect EMR use (p>0.05).\nUptake of EMR is increasing, although it is significantly slower in dermatology, ophthalmology, and psychiatry. Solo practitioners and owners of a practice have low frequencies of EMR use compared with non-solo practitioners and those who do not own their practice. Despite incentives for EMR adoption, physicians should carefully weigh which, if any, EMR to adopt in their practices."}, {"Title": "Omega-3 fatty acids in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Over the past 2 decades, omega-3 fatty acids (n-3FAs) have been increasingly used and studied in the United States and worldwide for various medical and psychiatric indications. Numerous published clinical trials have examined applications of different n-3FA preparations, primarily in mood disorders but also in psychotic disorders, attention-deficit disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and personality disorders. Focusing on clinical issues, this article reviews the impact of n-3FAs on these conditions and covers the relevant research, side effects, dosage guidelines, and drug interactions; clinicians should thus be able to better advise patients who are already taking n-3FAs or are interested in trying them."}, {"Title": "[Determine the patient's position towards psychiatric care: a simple tool to estimate the alliance and the motivation].", "Abstract": "For the brief systemic therapy (BST), the evaluation of the patient's position towards the care is a prerequisite to psychotherapy. Three positions of the patient are described. The \"tourist's\" position: the patient claims to have no problem and doesn't suffer. Someone asks him to make an appointment, sometimes with threats. The \"complaint's\" position: the patient claims to suffer, but attributes the responsibility of this suffering to others. These two positions are not good for beginning a therapy. The \"customer's\" position differs from both previous positions. The \"customer\" considers that he has a psychological problem which depends on him and he is motivated in the resolution of it. In theory, the \"customer\" is more motivated and the therapeutic alliance is better. It is for this reason that the BST estimates the position of the patient at first, to bring the patient to the \"customer's\" position. The objective of this study is to assess an interview which identifies the patient's position towards the care, and to validate the theoretical elaborations of the brief systemic therapy.\nThe study concerns the follow-up of outpatients who consult a psychiatrist for the first time. The evaluation of the patients checks their position towards care using the Tourist-Complaint-Customer (TCC) inventory, how they suffer, the therapeutic alliance (scale Haq-2) and the compliance during care. The evaluation by the psychiatrists checks the suffering perceived, the motivation perceived and the diagnoses according to the DSM.\nThe typology of these patients is made up of one half \"complaint\", a quarter of \"tourist\" and a quarter of \"customer\". The \"customer's\" position is correlated with the therapeutic alliance and the motivation perceived by the psychiatrist. The motivation perceived by the psychiatrist is correlated with the therapeutic alliance. These results correspond to the theoretical elaborations of the BST.\nthe TCC inventory provides information on the motivation and the therapeutic alliance. If the patient is in \"tourist\" or \"complaint\" position, we recommend that the psychiatrist \"work\" to bring the patient to \"customer\" position. The evaluation of the position of the patient is simple and rich in information. We recommend that it be given a place in the daily practice of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Advanced directives in psychiatry: A review of the qualitative literature, a state-of-the-art and viewpoints].", "Abstract": "Advance Directives are written documents, which are used for people to notify their preference for a future situation when they are unable to give their consent. In psychiatry, psychiatric advance directives (PADs) can be used for patients with chronic psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, or a bipolar disorder. PADs give the patient an opportunity to state wishes in advance about his/her treatment when he/she is in an acute state of illness. PADs were initially developed as a way for patients to defend themselves against the power of the psychiatrists, but are likely to become a useful tool in psychiatric care. PADs may contain information about medication, non pharmaceutical devices, and the name of a proxy decision maker. The main objective is to reduce the number of compulsory hospitalisations.\nThis article is a qualitative review which carries out a state-of-the-art on the use of PADs for people with chronic psychotic disorders and defines suggestions to include this intervention in the French psychiatric context.\nWe used the keywords psychiatric advance directives, crisis card, Ulysse directives, joint crisis plan (JCP) in the MEDLINE database to propose a qualitative review. We selected original clinical studies about the use of PADs for people with psychotic disorders.\nWe included 36\u00a0articles. The qualitative analysis identified seven main themes: different types of PADs, effectiveness of PADs, practical use of PADs, patient's views, clinician's views, economical aspects, and legal aspects. The content of the PADs is consistent with psychiatric standard care in nearly all cases, regarding medical instructions, pre-emergency interventions, non-hospital alternatives and non-medical personal care. Patients use their PADs to describe prodromal symptoms of relapse and to suggest a treatment and a hospitalisation in advance. PADs are not used to refuse all treatments. Patients show a strong interest in creating a directive and a high level of satisfaction when using it. They feel they have more control over their mental health problem and are more respected and valued as a person. Thirty-six to fifty-three percent of clinicians had positive opinions regarding PADs. They valued the increase of the patient's autonomy and the prevention of relapse, but were concerned about difficulties for accessing the documents, and about the lack of training of the medical teams. Clinicians also feared the pressure of relatives or partners on treatment decisions. The qualitative analysis revealed the specific benefit of the JCP, a particular type of PADs negotiated with the medical team, on the reduction of the general number of admissions. We can identify practical problems such as the lack of accessibility to PADs in emergency situations, and the clinician's reluctance to use PADs. The only economical evaluation showed a non-significant decrease in total costs.\nPADs are used in a few countries, although their benefits in terms of patient's perceptions and compulsory admissions are promising. The JCP proposes a specific clinical approach based on therapeutic alliance. Its creation also involves the clinician, family members and a neutral mediator in a negotiated process. The JCP is likely to be the most efficient PAD model in reducing compulsory admissions. The use of the JCP appears to be relevant in the context of the new French legislation, establishing outpatient commitment orders and could be an effective way to improve the relationships with patients."}, {"Title": "The production and recognition of psychiatric original articles published in languages other than English.", "Abstract": "Whereas the most influential journals in psychiatry are English language journals, periodicals published in other languages serve an important purpose for local communities of clinicians and researchers.

Persons suffering from mental ill-health are a vulnerable group, and loneliness influences the perception of physical, social, and emotional well-being. However, there are few studies exploring lived experiences of loneliness among people with mental ill-health. This qualitative study aimed to illuminate experiences of loneliness among people with mental ill-health. Five individual, informal conversational interviews were performed and subjected to qualitative content analysis. The main findings showed that experiences of loneliness could be metaphorically described as looking at the world through a frosted window. The experiences of loneliness were multifaceted and altering as well as emotionally and socially excluding. The findings are discussed in relation to Tillich dimensions of loneliness: loneliness as a painful dimension of being alone, and solitude as the enriching dimension of being alone. People suffering from mental ill-health carry a twofolded stigma. They feel socially undesirable because of their mental ill-health, and the social perceptions of lonely people are generally unfavourable. We believe that mental health nurses can support the developing and creative dimension of loneliness through a confirming approach, where people with mental ill-health feel seen, heard, and respected as human beings."}, {"Title": "Education Research: unsatisfactory NEX rating correlations: searching for the reasons.", "Abstract": "To determine whether the previously demonstrated poor correlation between local faculty and external American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) examiners evaluating the Neurology Evaluation Exercise (NEX) is attributable to a difference between raters who know the residents and raters who do not, a difference between raters with ABPN experience and raters without it, or some other factor.\nDeidentified NEX encounters were videotaped at 2 neurology residency programs.

We used the Medline-Pubmed database as an information resource. We focus on the bibliometric aspects of journals, papers and authors using the indicators offered by the Web of Science, the Journal Citation Reports and the Essential Science Indicators. We identify the output of Spanish researchers, journals in which they are published, authors and main research fields.\nFrom 2002 to 2011, Spanish researchers published 159 papers, that is, nearly 2% of the world's share in Prison Health. The publication profile is mainly in international journals with an average impact on JCR. The Revista Espa\u00f1ola de Sanidad Penitenciaria is the most productive journal (9.09%), although its role is not prominent. Only two authors can be considered as medium-high productive authors with 10 papers in the study time period. The co-authors network shows a dense network with 14 authors along with minor fragmented networks. As regards citations, 6 papers have been cited 15 or more times and only two can be considered as highly cited. Three main research fronts have been identified: infectious diseases, drugs and psychiatric-psychological problems.\nThe Spanish research production on Prison Health represents a similar share of the world output similar to that of other disciplines (1.9%), although slightly lower (General Medicine represents 3.05%; Public Health, 2.38%; Psychiatry, 2.29%; Toxicology, 2.46%). It seems likely that this share will increase as a result of the inclusion of its main journal in Medline along with an increasing number of researchers working on this discipline at an international level.

Of this cohort, 283 patients had an 18-month discharge diagnosis of FES and 64 had a diagnosis of FESA. DSM-IV diagnoses and clinical and functional ratings were derived and validated by two consultant psychiatrists.\nCompared to FES patients, those with FESA were significantly more likely to have a later age of onset (p=.004), longer prodrome (p=.020), and a longer duration of untreated psychosis (p<.001). At service entry, FESA patients presented with a higher illness severity (p=.020), largely due to the presence of more severe manic symptoms (p<.001). FESA patients also had a greater number of subsequent inpatient admissions (p=.017), had more severe depressive symptoms (p=.011), and higher levels of functioning at discharge.\nThe findings support the notion that these might be considered two discernable disorders; however, further research is required to ascertain the ways and extent to which these disorders are discriminable at presentation and over time."}, {"Title": "Prediction of community mental health service utilization by individual and ecological level socio-economic factors.", "Abstract": "Individuals with a more deprived socioeconomic status (SES) are more likely to have higher rates of psychiatric morbidity and use of psychiatric services.

Socio-economic characteristics were described using a SES Index and two new Resources Accessibility Indexes. Low SES was found to be associated with more community service contacts. When other individual and ecological variables were controlled for, SES was negatively associated only with the number of home visits, which was about half the rate in deprived areas. An association between service utilization and the resources of the catchment area was also detected.

Our review examined evidence of an association between the COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism and both neuropsychological performance and brain structure in patients with psychosis, in their relatives and in healthy individuals (step 1). The review also explored whether the neuropsychological tasks and brain structures identified in step 1 met the criteria for an endophenotype (step 2). Then we evaluated evidence that the neuropsychological endophenotypes identified in step 2 are associated with the brain structure endophenotypes identified in that step (step 3). Finally, we propose a neurobiological interpretation for this evidence.\nA poorer performance on the n-back task and the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and smaller temporal and frontal brain areas were associated with the COMT Val allele in patients with schizophrenia and their relatives and met most of the criteria for an endophenotype. It is possible that the COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism therefore contributes to the development of these neuropsychological and brain structural endophenotypes of schizophrenia, in which the prefrontal cortex may represent the neural substrate underlying both n-back and CPT performances.\nThe association between a single genetic variant and an endophenotype does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between them.\nThis evidence and the proposed interpretation contribute to explain, at least in part, the biological substrate of 4 important endophenotypes that characterize schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Suicide pacts: six cases and literature review.", "Abstract": "A suicide pact is the decision of two or more people to die together.

Due to very considerable progress in the basic and clinical neurosciences of sleep-wake cycles and underlying circadian systems this situation is now rapidly changing.\nThe development of specific behavioral or pharmacological strategies that target these basic regulatory systems is driving renewed clinical interest. Here, we explore the extent to which objective tests of sleep-wake cycles and circadian function - namely, those that measure timing or synchrony of circadian-dependent physiology as well as daytime activity and nighttime sleep patterns - can be used to identify a sub-class of patients with major depression who have disturbed circadian profiles.\nOnce this unique pathophysiology is characterized, a highly personalized treatment plan can be proposed and monitored.

Pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions have been extensively examined, whereas knowledge is scant regarding other professional perspectives. This article focuses on the physiotherapeutic perspective on anxiety, exploring physiotherapists' perceptions of their treatment for patients with generalized anxiety. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 physiotherapists working in psychiatry or primary health care. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis, resulting in one main category and five subcategories. The main category \"To sense and make sense of one's anxiety\" reflects the idea that physiotherapy works through immediate, tangible bodily experiences to help a person understand and handle his or her anxiety better. Five subcategories reflected different aspects of this main category: (1) the body is the arena of anxiety, (2) to get in touch with oneself, (3) to get down-to-earth with oneself, (4) to make sense of bodily sensations, and (5) to gain trust in one's capability to handle anxiety. In conclusion, the gradual bodily awareness of sensations, to sense and make sense of anxiety in physiotherapy treatment, becomes an opportunity to find ways to withstand and to manage symptoms of anxiety, encouraging an embodied self-trust. The emphasis on the immediately lived body involves the potential to learn how to endure anxiety instead of running away from it, to discern and to understand different sensations, leading to an integration of anxiety as being part of oneself rather than overflowing oneself."}, {"Title": "Harnessing clinical psychiatric data with an electronic assessment tool (OPCRIT+): the utility of symptom dimensions.", "Abstract": "Progress in personalised psychiatry is dependent on researchers having access to systematic and accurately acquired symptom data across clinical diagnoses.

Six components, explaining 46% of the variance in recorded symptoms, were extracted. The components represented dimensions of mania, depression, positive symptoms, anxiety, negative symptoms and disorganization. As indicated by component scores, different clinical diagnoses demonstrated distinct symptom profiles characterized by wide-ranging levels of severity. When comparing the predictive value of symptoms against diagnosis for a variety of clinical outcome measures (e.g. 'Overactive, aggressive behaviour'), symptoms proved superior in five instances (R(2) range: 0.06-0.28) whereas diagnosis was best just once (R(2):0.25).

However, there is as yet no consensus on this matter in the literature, and results vary according to the stigma dimension assessed and to the cultural background of the sample. The aim of this investigation was to search for profiles of stigmatizing beliefs related to schizophrenia in a national sample of psychiatrists in Brazil.\nA sample of 1414 psychiatrists were recruited from among those attending the 2009 Brazilian Congress of Psychiatry. A questionnaire was applied in face-to-face interviews. The questionnaire addressed four stigma dimensions, all in reference to individuals with schizophrenia: stereotypes, restrictions, perceived prejudice and social distance. Stigma item scores were included in latent profile analyses; the resulting profiles were entered into multinomial logistic regression models with sociodemographics, in order to identify significant correlates.\nThree profiles were identified. The \"no stigma\" subjects (n = 337) characterized individuals with schizophrenia in a positive light, disagreed with restrictions, and displayed a low level of social distance. The \"unobtrusive stigma\" subjects (n = 471) were significantly younger and displayed the lowest level of social distance, although most of them agreed with involuntary admission and demonstrated a high level of perceived prejudice. The \"great stigma\" subjects (n = 606) negatively stereotyped individuals with schizophrenia, agreed with restrictions and scored the highest on the perceived prejudice and social distance dimensions. In comparison with the first two profiles, this last profile comprised a significantly larger number of individuals who were in frequent contact with a family member suffering from a psychiatric disorder, as well as comprising more individuals who had no such family member.\nOur study not only provides additional data related to an under-researched area but also reveals that psychiatrists are a heterogeneous group regarding stigma toward schizophrenia.

Data were collected in the form of observations of practitioner-patient-family attendant interactions at the Outpatient Department, and interviews with patients, patients' family members, and psychiatric professionals at the Inpatient Department 2001-2004. Analysis found that many of the professionals' verbal interventions attempted to promote egalitarian styles of communication and relating among patients' family members. Psychiatrists perceived mental health problems as stemming from structural violence inherent in the North Indian institution of the family, which they described as organized hierarchically according to gender, age, and generation. One strategy evident in interventions deployed 'traditional' values, beliefs, and maxims irreverently in an attempt to re-order or level hierarchical differences. Another strategy invoked the concept of individual rights in an effort to empower weaker family members and enlighten powerful members regarding the destructive impact of relational styles predicated on inequality. Unfortunately, the professionals experienced their psychosocial interventions as unsuccessful. The paper suggests that rigid interactional norms across class statuses, an emphasis on liberal individual rights versus community rights, and a harsh exhortative style, contributed to the sense that the interventions alienated non-elite patients and family attendants."}, {"Title": "Attitudes towards suicidal behaviour in outpatient clinics among mental health professionals in Oslo.", "Abstract": "To investigate attitudes of professionals working in mental health care outpatient clinics in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (CAP) (for children and adolescents aged 0-18 years) and District Psychiatric Centres (DPC) (for adults aged 18-67 years).\nProfessionals in four outpatient units in Oslo were enrolled (n = 229: 77%). The Understanding of Suicidal Patient scale (USP) (11 = positive to 55 = negative) and Attitudes Towards Suicide questionnaire (ATTS) (1 = totally disagree to 5 = totally agree) were used to assess professionals' attitudes. Questions explored competence, religion, experiences of and views on suicidal behaviour and its treatment.\nAll the professionals indicated positive attitudes (USP 18.7) and endorsed the view that suicide was preventable (ATTS 4.3). Professionals who had received supervision or were specialists had attitudes that were more positive. Professionals in CAP were less satisfied with available treatment. Psychiatric disorders were considered the most common cause of suicidal behaviour, and psychotherapy the most appropriate form of treatment.

Another problem is the deficient cooperation between psychiatry and child psychiatry. Therefore early recognition centers were founded, in Germany primarily with focus on psychosis and in research settings.\nThe early recognition center in Dresden offers a low-threshold and anonym service for young people independent of diagnosis. The multiprofessional team including psychologists, psychiatrists and child psychiatrists applies defined standards. In addition to standard history taking and formally assessing psychopathology, early recognition instruments for psychosis and bipolar disorders are used as appropriate.\nIn 167 out of 192 individuals a structured diagnostic procedure was recommended, 149 persons (89 %) completed the procedure. Thereof 78 (52 %) persons fulfilled criteria for one, 21 (14 %) persons for two and 10 (7 %) persons for three mental disorders. 49 (33 %) persons fulfilled criteria for (Ultra)high risk for psychosis and/or bipolar disorders.\nIn the majority of cases diagnostic criteria for at least one mental illness was already fulfilled. All diagnosis and stages from prodromal till chronic were represented. The high percentage of subjects fulfilling criteria for (ultra)high risk-constellations offers the chance for early interventions.

We describe an exploratory study with the primary objective of establishing the feasibility of linking salivary concentrations of three hormones (testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], and cortisol) with aggression. Between May 2011 and November 2011, we recruited 17 psychiatrically hospitalized boys (age 7-9 years). We administered the Brief Rating of Aggression by Children and Adolescents (BRACHA) and Predatory-Affective Aggression Scale (PAAS) upon admission. Saliva samples were collected from the participants during a 24-h period shortly after admission: immediately upon awakening, 30 min later, and again between 3:45 and 7:45 P.M. Nursing staff recorded Overt Aggression Scale ratings twice a day during hospitalization to quantify aggressive behavior. The salivary cortisol concentrations obtained from aggressive boys 30 min after awakening trended higher than levels from the non-aggressive boys (p = 0.06), were correlated with the number of aggressive incidents (p = 0.04), and trended toward correlation with BRACHA scores (p = 0.06). The aggressive boys also showed greater morning-to-evening declines in cortisol levels (p = 0.05). Awakening levels of DHEA and testosterone were correlated with the severity of the nearest aggressive incident (p < 0.05 for both). The BRACHA scores of the aggressive boys were significantly higher than scores of the non-aggressive boys (p < 0.001). Our data demonstrate the feasibility of collecting saliva from children on an inpatient psychiatric unit, affirm the utility of the BRACHA in predicting aggressive behavior, and suggest links between salivary hormones and aggression by children who undergo psychiatric hospitalization."}, {"Title": "Helping oxytocin deliver: considerations in the development of oxytocin-based therapeutics for brain disorders.", "Abstract": "Concerns regarding a drought in psychopharmacology have risen from many quarters. From one perspective, the wellspring of bedrock medications for anxiety disorders, depression, and schizophrenia was serendipitously discovered over 30 year ago, the swell of pharmaceutical investment in drug discovery has receded, and the pipeline's flow of medications with unique mechanisms of action (i.e., glutamatergic agents, CRF antagonists) has slowed to a trickle. Might oxytocin (OT)-based therapeutics be an oasis? Though a large basic science literature and a slowly increasing number of studies in human diseases support this hope, the bulk of extant OT studies in humans are single-dose studies on normals, and do not directly relate to improvements in human brain-based diseases. Instead, these studies have left us with a field pregnant with therapeutic possibilities, but barren of definitive treatments. In this clinically oriented review, we discuss the extant OT literature with an eye toward helping OT deliver on its promise as a therapeutic agent. To this end, we identify 10 key questions that we believe future OT research should address. From this overview, several conclusions are clear: (1) the OT system represents an extremely promising target for novel CNS drug development; (2) there is a pressing need for rigorous, randomized controlled clinical trials targeting actual patients; and (3) in order to inform the design and execution of these vital trials, we need further translational studies addressing the questions posed in this review. Looking forward, we extend a cautious hope that the next decade of OT research will birth OT-targeted treatments that can truly deliver on this system's therapeutic potential."}, {"Title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for depression: analysis of response using a three-factor structure of the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg depression rating scale.", "Abstract": "There is growing evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be an effective treatment for depression. However, no study to date has profiled the antidepressant effects of tDCS using items or factors on depression symptom severity rating scales. This could potentially provide information about the mechanisms by which tDCS achieves its antidepressant effects and also identify clinical predictors of response.\nThe present study analysed scores on the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg depression rating scale (MADRS) from a randomised, sham-controlled trial of tDCS (Loo et al., 2012. British Journal of Psychiatry. 200, 52-59) using a three-factor model of MADRS items (Suzuki et al., 2005. Depression and Anxiety. 21, 95-97) encompassing dysphoria, retardation and vegetative symptoms.\nParticipants in the active tDCS treatment group showed significant improvement in dysphoria while participants in the sham treatment group did not. While both groups showed improvement in retardation symptoms, improvement was significantly greater in the active tDCS group. Both groups also showed improvement in vegetative symptoms but there were no between-group differences.\nFurther studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to investigate the generalisability of results and whether the MADRS factor structure may change as a result of the specific treatment used.\ntDCS appears to be particularly effective in treating dysphoria and retardation, but not vegetative symptoms of depression. This may have implications for selection of types of depression most likely to respond to this treatment."}, {"Title": "Stroke education in the Philippines.", "Abstract": "Education is paramount in effectively reducing the significant burden of stroke in the Philippines.

This study seeks to explore the effectiveness of treatment as usual (TAU) for depression in a large cohort of psychiatric outpatients receiving psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or combined treatment within an academic medical center. Initial and follow-up self-report assessments were analyzed for 1,322 patients receiving treatment for depression. Using these data, we determined treatment effect sizes, rates of reliable improvement (and deterioration), and rates of clinically significant improvement for psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and combined care. On average, all treatments produced significant improvement with effect sizes surpassing our no-treatment benchmark. No significant between-group (treatment) differences in self-report outcomes were found. The rates of reliable change were similar for all treatment groups consistent with past research.

Its use in movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, tremor and dystonia is now well established and has been approved by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE). The NICE does, however, emphasise the need for a multidisciplinary team to manage these patients. Such a team is traditionally composed of neurologists, neurosurgeons and neuropsychologists. Neuropsychiatrists, however, are increasingly recognised as essential members given many psychiatric considerations that may arise in patients undergoing DBS. Patient selection, assessment of competence to consent and treatment of postoperative psychiatric disease are just a few areas where neuropsychiatric input is invaluable. Partly driven by this close team working and partly based on the early history of DBS for psychiatric disorders, there is increasing interest in re-exploring the potential of neurosurgery to treat patients with psychiatric disease, such as depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Although the clinical experience and evidence with DBS in this group of patients are steadily increasing, many questions remain unanswered. Yet, the characteristics of optimal surgical candidates, the best choice of DBS target, the most effective stimulating parameters and the extent of postoperative improvement are not clear for most psychiatric conditions. Further research is therefore required to define how DBS can be best utilised to improve the quality of life of patients with psychiatric disease."}, {"Title": "Dual agency and ethics conflicts in correctional practice: sources and solutions.", "Abstract": "Psychiatrists working in corrections, particularly in areas that have a shortage of forensic practitioners, may encounter a variety of ethics-related conflicts, especially when working both as clinicians and forensic evaluators within smaller systems. Such conflicts may include unavoidable dual treating and forensic evaluator relationships, and awareness of information that may complicate patient treatment or influence forensic opinions. Additional conflicts may arise if the psychiatrist is also retained privately to conduct forensic evaluations involving inmates in the same facility or facilities where the psychiatrist is otherwise employed, specifically because he may have duties to both a retaining party and an employer. Early-career psychiatrists, those who are completing their training in forensic psychiatry, and general psychiatrists who practice in corrections may be unfamiliar with the ethics-related dilemmas that arise in jails or prisons. Ethics courses during medical school and residency, while required, rarely discuss dilemmas specific to correctional settings. Furthermore, many psychiatrists practicing in corrections do not undergo formal training in forensic psychiatry, and even among different fellowship programs, the amount of time devoted to corrections varies significantly. The authors discuss hypothetical cases that reflect situations encountered, particularly by psychiatric fellows, forensic psychiatrists new to correctional work, and nonforensic clinicians working in corrections, a setting where dual agency is common and at times in conflict with core principles of ethics, including beneficence, nonmaleficence, neutrality, objectivity, and justice."}, {"Title": "Locks, keys, and security of mind: psychodynamic approaches to forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In this article, we discuss psychological approaches to the understanding of acts of violence and, specifically, psychodynamic approaches to both formulation and treatment.

During his medical studies in Moscow, he wrote short stories, at night, under various pseudonyms to provide money for his family; all his life, Chekhov was his parents' financial support. It was Alexei Suvorin (1834-1912), the powerful director of Novoye Vremya (New Times), and the well-known writer Dimitry Grigorovich (1822-1899) who persuaded him that he had exceptional literary talent and requested him to abandon pseudonyms and sign his articles.

Interpretation of fictitious psychopaths needs to be related to the historical situation in which the novels were written; such investigations can be both enriching and thrilling."}, {"Title": "The Nadja case.", "Abstract": "On October 4, 1926, a young woman who seemed lost in the street met one of the most important writers of the century, Andr\u00e9 Breton, who had just published the First Manifesto of Surrealism two years before. The young woman was named L\u00e9ona Delcourt, but one used to call her Nadja. She fell in love with Breton, but he remained more interested in her poetic strangeness, which expressed itself in her conversation, drawings, and letters. Their intimate relationship lasted only ten days, but correspondence continued until March 1927, when she developed acute psychosis and was interned in psychiatric wards for the rest of her life. A few months later, Breton published Nadja, one of the most famous novels of the twentieth century. He had intentionally written it as a clinical report (though violently criticizing psychiatry and psychiatrists) lacking emotional features, and it was partly influenced by his own neuropsychiatric experience during the war as a medical student working with Raoul Leroy and Joseph Babinski. Breton's apparent coldness associated with the dramatic fate of Nadja has often been interpreted unfavorably, as he supposedly missed a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia in her. However, a careful look at Nadja's letters to Breton suggests that hallucinations and delirium were absent before the March 1927 decompensation, and her behavior may be one of the best available examples of the fascinating poetic instability which may precede acute psychosis."}, {"Title": "Balzac's Louis Lambert : schizophrenia before Kraepelin and Bleuler.", "Abstract": "Honor\u00e9 de Balzac (1799-1850) is well known for his penetrating observations and descriptions of the burgeoning social life and emerging modernity of 19th century France. This chapter focuses on the novel Louis Lambert, first published in 1832. It is argued that its main character provides the first complete and convincing description of schizophrenia - 69 years before Kraepelin fully developed the concept of dementia praecox and 76 years before Bleuler coined the word 'schizophrenia'. We consider the history of the concept of schizophrenia and the intriguing possibility that it is a recent disease. Indeed, if schizophrenia had always existed, it would seem odd that Balzac's novel should be the very first convincing and complete literary account of the disease. This claim is examined by a thorough description of Louis Lambert's symptoms as they appear in the text, and compared to other claims of priority (namely, Shakespeare's King Lear and Gogol's Diary of a Madman). The chapter also provides some background on Balzac's relationship with mysticism, mental illness, and the world of psychiatry. We conclude with remarks regarding influences of Louis Lambert, the case for the priority of the novel as the princeps case of schizophrenia, and its relevance to the recency hypothesis of schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Madness in blaise cendrars' novels: moravagine and company.", "Abstract": "The literary work of Blaise Cendrars (1887-1961), n\u00e9 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sauser, one of the major French-speaking authors of the 20th century, is imbued with references to neuropsychiatry. This theme is a constant presence in his writing as a result of his involvement of the First World War and his personal experiences, which were punctuated with neurologic and psychiatric events. Cendrars' own particular ideas on the genesis of mental disorders went against the more traditional views on psychiatry. He remained skeptical about hysteria and did not subscribe to psychoanalysis. His ideas were enriched by his experience with the war-related neuropsychiatric problems developed by soldiers. He thus proposed the notion of 'pathological fear' surrounding these disorders. There are a number of characters suffering from 'borderline' mental disorders in Cendrars' work, including two shocking, mad murderers, Moravagine and F\u00e9bronio. The character Moravagine, a neurology patient suffering from a brain tumor, enabled Cendrars to delve into the grey areas that can exist between neurologic and psychiatric diseases. F\u00e9bronio, a real psychotic, enabled Cendrars to explore ethnopsychiatry."}, {"Title": "A meta-analysis of cortical inhibition and excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation in psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "To evaluate transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures of inhibition and excitation in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ).\nParadigms included: short-interval cortical inhibition (SICI), cortical silent period (CSP), resting motor threshold, intracortical facilitation, and motor evoked potential amplitude.

In an effort to thoroughly investigate potential etiological origins and optimal interventions, this broad review is divided into five sections: the stress response, chronic diseases, mind-body theoretical models, psychophysiological interventions, and integrated health care solutions. The stress response and its correlation to chronic disorders such as cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, autoimmune, metabolic syndrome, and chronic pain are comprehensively explored. Current mind-body theoretical models, including peripheral nerve pathway, neurophysiological, and integrative theories, are reviewed to elucidate the biological mechanisms behind psychophysiological interventions. Specific interventions included are psychotherapy, mindfulness meditation, yoga, and psychopharmacology. Finally, the author advocates for an integrated care approach as a means by which to blur the sharp distinction between physical and psychological health. Integrated care approaches can utilize psychiatric nurse practitioners for behavioral assessment, intervention, research, advocacy, consultation, and education to optimize health outcomes."}, {"Title": "Trends in scientific literature on atypical antipsychotics in South Korea: a bibliometric study.", "Abstract": "We have carried out a bibliometric study on the scientific publications in relation to atypical or second-generation antipsychotic drugs (SGAs) in South Korea.\nWith the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, we selected those publications made in South Korea whose title included the descriptors atypic(*) (atypical(*)) antipsychotic(*), second-generation antipsychotic(*), clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, quetiapine, sertindole, aripiprazole, paliperidone, amisulpride, zotepine, asenapine, iloperidone, lurasidone, perospirone and blonanserin.

Structural equivalence implies that constructs have the same meaning across groups, metric equivalence implies that the metric of the scales remains stable across groups, and full scale or scalar equivalence implies that the origin of the scales is the same across groups. Several studies have observed that the structure underlying both normal personality and personality disorders (PDs) is stable across cultures. Most of this cross-cultural research was conducted in Western and Asian cultures. In Africa, the few studies were conducted with well-educated participants using French or English instruments. No research was conducted in Africa with less privileged or preliterate samples. The aim of this research was to study the structure and expression of normal and abnormal personality in an urban and a rural sample in Burkina Faso. The sample included 1,750 participants, with a sub-sample from the urban area of Ouagadougou (n\u2009=\u20091,249) and another sub-sample from a rural village, Soumiaga (n\u2009=\u2009501). Most participants answered an interview consisting of a Moor\u00e9 language adaptation of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory and of the International Personality Disorders Examination. Moor\u00e9 is the language of the Mossi ethnic group, and the most frequently spoken local language in Burkina Faso. A sub-sample completed the same self-report instruments in French. Demographic variables only had a small impact on normal and abnormal personality traits mean levels. The structure underlying normal personality was unstable across regions and languages, illustrating that translating a complex psychological inventory into a native African language is a very difficult task. The structure underlying abnormal personality and the metric of PDs scales were stable across regions. As scalar equivalence was not reached, mean differences cannot be interpreted. Nevertheless, these differences could be due to an exaggerated expression of abnormal traits valued in the two cultural settings. Our results suggest that studies using a different methodology should be conducted to understand what is considered, in different cultures, as deviating from the expectations of the individual's culture, and as a significant impairment in self and interpersonal functioning, as defined by the DSM-5."}, {"Title": "Transference-focused psychotherapy in the general psychiatry residency: a useful and applicable model for residents in acute clinical settings.", "Abstract": "Transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP) is a manualized, psychodynamic treatment for severe personality disorders. Training in TFP during residency can provide a readily applicable model for understanding and treating personality pathology in a variety of settings, even for residents who do not obtain additional training in psychodynamic treatments or go on to practice psychotherapy. Although TFP was developed as a long-term outpatient treatment, the authors have found the diagnostic and theoretical framework and the clinical techniques described in the TFP treatment manual to be useful in acute settings, even when the clinician does not have a clearly established relationship with the patient. In the authors' experience, residents find this model of understanding and working with patients with personality disorders enjoyable to learn and easy to apply."}, {"Title": "Psychodynamic cultural psychiatry: a new approach to teaching residents.", "Abstract": "This article describes a course, Psychodynamic Cultural Psychiatry, taught to PGY-3 residents at the New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center that uses psychodynamic theory to help deepen cultural understanding.

Enthusiasm about psychopharmacological treatments and neuroscientific understandings is giving way to a sobering recognition of the limitations of current biologically oriented approaches. Psychiatry training programs have both an opportunity and a responsibility to address the challenges presented by the evidence. Although the average psychiatrist would profess a biopsychosocial ideal, an examination of our practice, journals, and training curricula suggests that we still have a long way to go before we employ a truly integrated model. There is a compelling, though oft-neglected evidence base demonstrating that pharmacologic treatment outcomes are as dependent on psychological and interpersonal factors as on medical ones. In order to maximize our usefulness to patients, psychiatry must embrace more complex and integrated understandings, transcending reductionistic models that promote mind-body splits. This article explores some of the costs of a model that places disproportionate emphasis on a biological framework. Relevant evidence bases are reviewed that demonstrate the utility of emphasizing the psychology of psychopharmacology. Implications for psychiatric training are considered, and suggestions are made for better integrating meaning factors into psychopharmacology education."}, {"Title": "The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for the biological treatment of bipolar disorders: update 2012 on the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "These guidelines are based on a first edition that was published in 2004, and have been edited and updated with the available scientific evidence up to October 2012. Their purpose is to supply a systematic overview of all scientific evidence pertaining to the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder in adults.\nMaterial used for these guidelines are based on a systematic literature search using various data bases. Their scientific rigor was categorised into six levels of evidence (A-F) and different grades of recommendation to ensure practicability were assigned.\nMaintenance trial designs are complex and changed fundamentally over time; thus, it is not possible to give an overall recommendation for long-term treatment. Different scenarios have to be examined separately: Prevention of mania, depression, or an episode of any polarity, both in acute responders and in patients treated de novo. Treatment might differ in Bipolar II patients or Rapid cyclers, as well as in special subpopulations. We identified several medications preventive against new manic episodes, whereas the current state of research into the prevention of new depressive episodes is less satisfactory. Lithium continues to be the substance with the broadest base of evidence across treatment scenarios.\nAlthough major advances have been made since the first edition of this guideline in 2004, there are still areas of uncertainty, especially the prevention of depressive episodes and optimal long-term treatment of Bipolar II patients."}, {"Title": "Pathologizing sexual deviance: a history.", "Abstract": "This article provides a historical perspective on how both American and European psychiatrists have conceptualized and categorized sexual deviance throughout the past 150 years. During this time, quite a number of sexual preferences, desires, and behaviors have been pathologized and depathologized at will, thus revealing psychiatry's constant struggle to distinguish mental disorder--in other words, the \"perversions,\" \"sexual deviations,\" or \"paraphilias\"--from immoral, unethical, or illegal behavior. This struggle is apparent in the works of 19th- and early-20th-century psychiatrists and sexologists, but it is also present in the more recent psychiatric textbooks and diagnostic manuals, such as the consecutive editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). While much of the historical literature revolves around the controversy over homosexuality, this article also reviews the recent medicohistorical and sociohistorical work on other forms of sexual deviance, including the diagnostic categories listed in the latest edition, the DSM-IV-TR: exhibitionism, voyeurism, fetishism, frotteurism, pedophilia, sexual masochism, sexual sadism, and transvestic fetishism."}, {"Title": "Teaching recovery to medical students.", "Abstract": "Community mental health services are evolving toward more holistic, patient-centered, recovery-based practices. This change necessitates an attitudinal shift from mental health workers, and training in recovery principles is helpful in achieving this change. Medical students often have narrow, doctor-centered concepts of mental health care. Traditional clinical placements in psychiatry do little to address this. We evaluated a recovery-focused teaching program for medical students in psychiatry.\nMedical students' knowledge of recovery from mental illness was assessed before and after either a 6-week traditional or recovery-focused clinical placement in psychiatry, using the Recovery Knowledge Inventory. A validated questionnaire was used to assess attitudes toward mental illness before and after the placements. Focus groups were conducted before and after the recovery teaching.\nOne hundred nineteen medical students participated; 23 experienced the recovery teaching program while 96 had a traditional placement (23 in the same center as the recovery teaching program and 73 in other centers). There were no significant differences between groups at baseline. After recovery teaching, medical students significantly increased their recovery knowledge and had more positive attitudes toward mental illness and psychiatry when compared with those who had a traditional placement. The focus groups revealed greater optimism and more holistic concepts of recovery from mental illness.\nThe recovery teaching program was associated with increased knowledge of recovery principles and more positive attitudes toward mental illness.

Previous consensus opinion was that levels should be kept below 0.6 mmol/L in geriatric patients to minimize renal toxicity.\nWe hypothesized that elevated serum lithium levels correlate with decreased renal function [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)] in geriatric psychiatry outpatients.\nThis was a 4-year retrospective cohort study (2007-2011).\nWe performed this study in three Canadian university-affiliated tertiary care clinics.\nData from 42 lithium-using geriatric psychiatry outpatients was used. INTERVENTION/EXPOSURE: Our main exposure of interest was mean serum lithium level between 2007 and 2011.\nOur primary outcome was change in eGFR between 2007 and 2011 (hypothesis formulated before data collection).\nLithium levels did not correlate significantly with change in eGFR at 2- or 4-year follow-up (r < 0.12, p > 0.57). There were no significant predictors of change in eGFR in a multiple linear regression model including hypertension, diabetes, baseline eGFR, lithium duration, and lithium levels.\nLithium levels do not correlate strongly (\u03c1 > 0.5) with decreased eGFR at 2- and 4-year follow-up in geriatric outpatients. These results are not reliably generalizable when treating patients at mean lithium levels greater than 0.8 mEq/L, especially at 4-year follow-up, and larger studies will be necessary to examine the possibility of a smaller correlation.

Balancing motherhood and work commitments is the biggest challenge faced by female doctors with children and causes some to change career pathways."}, {"Title": "Medical attendance for lower urinary tract symptoms is associated with subsequent increased risk of outpatient visits and hospitalizations based on a nationwide population-based database.", "Abstract": "Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), which encompass storage, voiding, and postmicturition symptoms, are highly prevalent and recognized globally. Based on a nationwide population-based database, this study tests the hypothesis that medical attendance for LUTS is associated with a subsequent increase in the number of outpatient visits and hospitalizations, with differences among medical specialties and age groups.\nParticipants were selected from a random population sample of approximately one million people as a representative cohort of National Health Insurance (NHI) enrollees in Taiwan. Participants had at least three outpatient service claims with a coding of LUTS during the recruitment period 2001-2004. Both the LUTS group and non-LUTS control group were monitored for subsequent outpatient visits and hospitalizations, excluding LUTS-related healthcare services, for 2 years following the index date. The results were categorized based on medical specialty and age group.\nThe outpatient visit rates (no. per person-year) and adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) (95% confidence interval (CI) were significantly higher in urology (4.51, 95%CI 4.15-4.91) and gynecology (1.82, 95%CI 1.76-1.89) for the LUTS group. They were also significantly high in other departments, including internal medicine (1.25), general practice (1.13), Chinese medicine (1.77), family medicine (1.19), surgery (1.38), and psychiatry (1.98). Similarly, the hospitalization rate (no. per 1000 person-year) and adjusted IRRs (95% CI) were significantly higher in urology (5.50, 95% CI = 4.60-6.50) and gynecology (1.60, 95% CI = 1.35-1.90), as well as in internal medicine (1.55) and surgery (1.56), but not in psychiatry (1.12). Furthermore, the IRRs differed among 3 age groups.\nA significantly higher number of outpatient visits and hospitalizations were observed for individuals with LUTS, compared to the control group, and the effects differed with the advancement of age. This study broadens understanding of LUTS by viewing their impact on healthcare services with multiple and overlapping systems, rather than considering them exclusively as symptoms of traditional diseases of the bladder and urethra."}, {"Title": "Understanding and addressing religion among people with mental illness.", "Abstract": "This article reviews recent advances in the domain of psychiatry and religion that highlight the double-edged capacity of religion to enhance or damage health and well-being, particularly among psychiatric patients. A large body of research challenges stereotyped views of religion as merely a defense or passive way of coping, and indicates that many people look to religion as a vital resource which serves a variety of adaptive functions, such as self-regulation, attachment, emotional comfort, meaning, and spirituality. There is, however, a darker side to religious life. Researchers and theorists have identified and begun to study problematic aspects of religiousness, including religiously-based violence and religious struggles within oneself, with others, and with the divine. Religious problems can be understood as a by-product of psychiatric illness (secondary), a source of psychiatric illness (primary), or both (complex). This growing body of knowledge underscores the need to attend more fully to the potentially constructive and destructive roles of religion in psychiatric diagnosis, assessment, and treatment. In fact, initial evaluative studies of the impact of spiritually integrated treatments among a range of psychiatric populations have shown promising results. The article concludes with a set of recommendations to advance future research and practice, including the need for additional psychiatric studies of people from diverse cultures and religious traditions."}, {"Title": "Safety of the electroconvulsive therapy and amisulpride combination.", "Abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy is frequently considered when pharmacotherapy is ineffective. In such cases the combination of the two treatment modalities are commonly used. Amisulpiride, a second generation antipsychotic drug is used in the treatment of schizophrenia and psychotic depression. When amisulpiride is ineffective as a monotherapy, combination with ECT could be an option to enhance its efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, to date there have been no data about the safety of this combination.\nMedical notes of all patients who were given ECT while on amisulpiride were selected from the archives of the Department of Psychiatry, Semmelweis University Medical School, Budapest, covering a 10-year period. A randomly selected matched control group was formed from patients who underwent ECT but were not taking amisulpiride. Patients in both groups also received a variety of psychotropic drugs other than amisulpide. Side effects were compared between the two groups of patients.\nTwenty patients received amisulpride with ECT. The most common side effects were headache, hypertension, tachycardia, nausea, dizziness, confusion, psychomotor agitation, sialorrhea, and prolonged seizure activity. All adverse effects resolved within 24 hours. No side effects of any kind were observed in 7 and 8 cases in the study and control groups, respectively.\nThis was the first study that examined the safety of amisulpride-ECT combination in schizophrenia. Comparing the side-effects between the study and control groups, no significant differences were detected in terms of their types or frequency. The amisulpiride-ECT combination appears to be a safe treatment option."}, {"Title": "Johann Christian August Heinroth: psychosomatic medicine eighty years before Freud.", "Abstract": "Most often it is assumed that the 'psychosomatic' concept originated from psychoanalysis. However, this term had already been introduced into medical literature about 80 years before Sigmund Freud - namely by Johann Christian August Heinroth, the first professor of psychiatry and psychotherapy in the western world. Widely through quotations from his works, the authors analyze Heinroth's understanding of the interrelations between the body and the soul. For Heinroth both formed a unified, indivisable whole, which interacted in many ways, including pathologically. According to him, a mental illness had its cause in the patient's leading a 'wrong life'. This 'wrong life' deranged the soul from its normal functioning. In a second step, this derangement can have an impact on the body and produce the somatic symptoms that accompany a mental illness. Since both 'components' of the 'indivisible whole' were affected, it was clear for Heinroth that doctors needed to view their patients holistically and treat the whole person. Since in the end the somatic symptoms were caused by an underlying mental derangement, this needed to be treated in the first place - and the psyche could only be reached by direct psychological intervention. Hence what he called his 'direct-psychische Methode' ought to be the remedy of choice for mental illnesses. Through his clear understanding of the interactions of body and soul and by integrating somatic and psychological therapies into a holistic, unified treatment programm, Heinroth is of major importance for the history of psychosomatic medicine."}, {"Title": "Philosophy of clinical psychopharmacology.", "Abstract": "The renewal of the philosophical debate in psychiatry is one exciting news of recent years. However, its use in psychopharmacology may be problematic, ranging from self-confinement into the realm of values (which leaves the evidence-based domain unchallenged) to complete rejection of scientific evidence. In this paper philosophy is conceived as a conceptual audit of clinical psychopharmacology. Its function is to criticise the epistemological and methodological problems of current neopositivist, ingenuously realist and evidence-servant psychiatry from within the scientific stance and with the aim of aiding psychopharmacologists in practicing a more self-aware, critical and possibly useful clinical practice. Three examples are discussed to suggest that psychopharmacological practice needs conceptual clarification. At the diagnostic level it is shown that the crisis of the current diagnostic system and the problem of comorbidity strongly influence psychopharmacological results, new conceptualizations more respondent to the psychopharmacological requirements being needed. Heterogeneity of research samples, lack of specificity of psychotropic drugs, difficult generalizability of results, need of a phenomenological study of drug-induced psychopathological changes are discussed herein. At the methodological level the merits and limits of evidence-based practice are considered, arguing that clinicians should know the best available evidence but that guidelines should not be constrictive (due to several methodological biases and rhetorical tricks of which the clinician should be aware, sometimes respondent to extra-scientific, economical requests). At the epistemological level it is shown that the clinical stance is shaped by implicit philosophical beliefs about the mind/body problem (reductionism, dualism, interactionism, pragmatism), and that philosophy can aid physicians to be more aware of their beliefs in order to choose the most useful view and to practice coherently. In conclusion, psychopharmacologists already use methodological audit (e.g. statistical audit); similarly, conceptual clarification is needed in both research planning/evaluation and everyday psychopharmacological practice."}, {"Title": "Analysis and optimization of pulse dynamics for magnetic stimulation.", "Abstract": "Magnetic stimulation is a standard tool in brain research and has found important clinical applications in neurology, psychiatry, and rehabilitation. Whereas coil designs and the spatial field properties have been intensively studied in the literature, the temporal dynamics of the field has received less attention. Typically, the magnetic field waveform is determined by available device circuit topologies rather than by consideration of what is optimal for neural stimulation. This paper analyzes and optimizes the waveform dynamics using a nonlinear model of a mammalian axon. The optimization objective was to minimize the pulse energy loss. The energy loss drives power consumption and heating, which are the dominating limitations of magnetic stimulation. The optimization approach is based on a hybrid global-local method. Different coordinate systems for describing the continuous waveforms in a limited parameter space are defined for numerical stability. The optimization results suggest that there are waveforms with substantially higher efficiency than that of traditional pulse shapes. One class of optimal pulses is analyzed further. Although the coil voltage profile of these waveforms is almost rectangular, the corresponding current shape presents distinctive characteristics, such as a slow low-amplitude first phase which precedes the main pulse and reduces the losses. Representatives of this class of waveforms corresponding to different maximum voltages are linked by a nonlinear transformation. The main phase, however, scales with time only. As with conventional magnetic stimulation pulses, briefer pulses result in lower energy loss but require higher coil voltage than longer pulses."}, {"Title": "Recruitment and retention of mental health workers in Ghana.", "Abstract": "The lack of trained mental health workers is a primary contributor to the mental health treatment gap worldwide. Despite the great need to recruit and retain mental health workers in low-income countries, little is known about how these workers perceive their jobs and what drives them to work in mental health care. Using qualitative interviews, we aimed to explore factors motivating mental health workers in order to inform interventions to increase recruitment and retention.\nWe conducted 28 in-depth, open-ended interviews with staff in Ghana's three public psychiatric hospitals. We used the snowballing method to recruit participants and the constant comparative method for qualitative data analysis, with multiple members of the research team participating in data coding to enhance the validity and reliability of the analysis. The use of qualitative methods allowed us to understand the range and depth of motivating and demotivating factors.\nRespondents described many factors that influenced their choice to enter and remain in mental health care. Motivating factors included 1) desire to help patients who are vulnerable and in need, 2) positive day-to-day interactions with patients, 3) intellectual or academic interest in psychiatry or behavior, and 4) good relationships with colleagues. Demotivating factors included 1) lack of resources at the hospital, 2) a rigid supervisory hierarchy, 3) lack of positive or negative feedback on work performance, and 4) few opportunities for career advancement within mental health.\nBecause many of the factors are related to relationships, these findings suggest that strengthening the interpersonal and team dynamics may be a critical and relatively low cost way to increase worker motivation. The data also allowed us to highlight key areas for resource allocation to improve both recruitment and retention, including risk pay, adequate tools for patient care, improved hospital work environment, and stigma reduction efforts."}, {"Title": "Medical students' subjective ratings of stress levels and awareness of student support services about mental health.", "Abstract": "To descriptively assess medical students' concerns for their mental and emotional state, perceived need to conceal mental problems, perceived level of support at university, knowledge and use of student support services, and experience of stresses of daily life.\nFrom March to September 2011, medical students at an Australian university were invited to complete an anonymous online survey.\n475 responses were received. Students rated study and examinations (48.9%), financial concerns (38.1%), isolation (19.4%) and relationship concerns (19.2%) as very or extremely stressful issues. Knowledge of available support services was high, with 90.8% indicating they were aware of the university's medical centre. Treatment rates were modest (31.7%). Students' concerns about their mental state were generally low, but one in five strongly felt they needed to conceal their emotional problems.\nDespite widespread awareness of appropriate support services, a large proportion of students felt they needed to conceal mental and emotional problems. Overall treatment rates for students who were greatly concerned about their mental and emotional state appeared modest, and, although comparable with those of similarly aged community populations, may reflect undertreatment. It would be appropriate for universities to address stressors identified by students. Strategies for encouraging distressed students to obtain appropriate assessment and treatment should also be explored. Those students who do seek healthcare are most likely to see a primary care physician, suggesting an important screening role for these health professionals."}, {"Title": "The breathing conundrum-interoceptive sensitivity and anxiety.", "Abstract": "Cognitive and affective processing has been the central focus of brain-related functions in psychology and psychiatry for many years. Much less attention has been paid to what could be considered the primary function of the brain, to regulate the function of the body. Recent developments, which include the conceptualization of interoception as a process consisting of integrating the information coming from the inside of the body in the central nervous system and the appreciation that complex emotional processes are fundamentally affected by the processing and regulation of somatic states, have profoundly changed the view of the function and dysfunction of the brain. This review focuses on the relationship between breathing and anxiety. Several anxiety disorders have been associated with altered breathing, perception of breathing, and response to manipulations of breathing. Both clinical and experimental research studies are reviewed that relate breathing dysfunctions to anxiety. Altered breathing may be useful as a physiological marker of anxiety as well as a treatment target using interoceptive interventions."}, {"Title": "Talking about sex in the gender identity clinic: implications for training and practice.", "Abstract": "This article provides the first systematic examination of the ways 'talk about sex' is occasioned and managed by doctors and patients in real-life interactions in a National Health Service Gender Identity Clinic. Drawing on a corpus of 194 recordings of psychiatric assessment sessions, the article examines how parties initiate and develop talk about sex, and which strategies appear to work best for doctor-patient alignment. The analyses revealed that the most aligning methods were for clinicians to make transitions from asking questions about relationships in general to talk about sex, or to build opportunistically on patients' relationship talk. However, talk about sex that lacked specificity or which made inaccurate presumptions about patients' sex lives, generated misalignment between clinician and patient. I suggest that such misalignment is not intrinsically bad. Rather, it provides evidence for the virtues of a more nuanced understanding of patient-centred communication. The article concludes with a discussion of the importance of grounding communication skills training and clinical practice in recordings of actual consultations."}, {"Title": "The value of 'positive' clinical signs for weakness, sensory and gait disorders in conversion disorder: a systematic and narrative review.", "Abstract": "Experts in the field of conversion disorder have suggested for the upcoming DSM-V edition to put less weight on the associated psychological factors and to emphasise the role of clinical findings. Indeed, a critical step in reaching a diagnosis of conversion disorder is careful bedside neurological examination, aimed at excluding organic signs and identifying 'positive' signs suggestive of a functional disorder. These positive signs are well known to all trained neurologists but their validity is still not established. The aim of this study is to provide current evidence regarding their sensitivity and specificity. We conducted a systematic search on motor, sensory and gait functional signs in Embase, Medline, PsycINfo from 1965 to June 2012. Studies in English, German or French reporting objective data on more than 10 participants in a controlled design were included in a systematic review. Other relevant signs are discussed in a narrative review. Eleven controlled studies (out of 147 eligible articles) describing 14 signs (7 motor, 5 sensory, 2 gait) reported low sensitivity of 8-100% but high specificity of 92-100%. Studies were evidence class III, only two had a blinded design and none reported on inter-rater reliability of the signs. Clinical signs for functional neurological symptoms are numerous but only 14 have been validated; overall they have low sensitivity but high specificity and their use should thus be recommended, especially with the introduction of the new DSM-V criteria."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry in Korea.", "Abstract": "This paper reports the current status of Korean psychiatry. In 2011, there were 3005 psychiatrists and 75,000 psychiatric beds. There were 84 psychiatric residency-training hospitals in 2011, which produced about 150 psychiatry board-certified doctors annually. As for academic activity, there is the Korean Neuropsychiatric Association, a main association for neuropsychiatry, and 21 other research societies. Psychiatric residency is a 4-year training program, with different objectives for each grade. The Korean health system accepts National Health Insurance. When severely mentally ill patients register as having a mental disorder, they pay only 10% of their total medical costs. Private clinics usually see patients with less severe conditions such as anxiety, mood and eating disorders; general and university hospitals and special mental hospitals often deal with severe conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. One great concern is an increasing trend to depend upon pharmacotherapy and neglect the role of psychotherapy. Additionally, conflicts among medical sectors are becoming fierce as other doctors request abolition of the current law that restricts them from prescribing anti-depressants for more than 60 days. The average hospitalization period of all mental care institutions was 166 days in 2010, substantially longer compared with developed countries. To win the heart of the general public, cutting edge research to improve the quality of treatment for mental diseases, reformation of psychiatric residency training programs, public campaigns to increase awareness of mental health value, and timely reflection on policy decisions should be pursued persistently."}, {"Title": "Prevention and recovery in early psychosis (PREP(\u00ae)): building a public-academic partnership program in Massachusetts, United States.", "Abstract": "Recently, there has been increasing emphasis on early intervention (EI) for psychotic disorders. EI programs in public mental health settings have been established in countries such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada. However, there are relatively few EI programs in the United States (U.S.). Here we describe the conceptual origins and practical development of the PREP program, i.e., Prevention and Recovery in Early Psychosis, as it evolved in a public academic psychiatry setting in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. PREP developed over a decade through a partnership between the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health and academic institutions within the Harvard Department of Psychiatry. We discuss the evolution, programmatic features, funding mechanisms, staffing, and the role of clinical training in PREP. The key principles in developing the PREP Program include the focus on early, evidence based, person-centered and phase-specific, integrated and continuous, comprehensive care. This program has served as a foundation for the emergence of related services at our institution, including a research clinic treating those at clinical high risk or within the putative \"prodromal\" period preceding frank psychosis.

Through the pathophysiological roles of FAs in the brain and cardiovascular system, a hypothesized relationship between HPA-axis activity and FA-metabolism could form a possible missing link accounting for the association of HPA-axis hyperactivity with recurrence and cardiovascular disease in MDD. In 137 recurrent MDD-patients and 73 age- and sex-matched controls, we therefore investigated associations between salivary cortisol (morning and evening) and the following indicators of FA-metabolism measured in the red blood cell membrane: (I) three main FAs [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA)], and (II) structural FA indices (unsaturation, chain length, peroxidation) calculated from concentrations of 29 FAs to delineate overall FA-characteristics. In addition, we compared these associations in patients with those in controls. In patients, evening cortisol concentrations were significantly negatively associated with DHA (B=-1.358; SE=0.499; t=-2.72; p=.006), the unsaturation index (B=-0.021; SE=0.009; t=-2.42; p=.018), chain length index (B=-0.060; SE=0.025; t=-2.41; p=.019), and peroxidation index (B=-0.029; SE=0.012; t=-2.48; p=.015). The relations between cortisol and the latter three variables were significantly negative in patients relative to controls. Significance remained after correction for confounders.

Because bullying often presents with accompanying serious emotional and behavioral symptoms, there has been an increase in psychiatric referrals to emergency departments. Emergency physicians may be the first responders in the health care system for bullying episodes. Victims of bullying may present with nonspecific symptoms and be reluctant to disclose being victimized, contributing to the underdiagnosis and underreporting of bully victimization. Emergency physicians therefore need to have heightened awareness of physical and psychosocial symptoms related to bullying.

Moreover, according to recent research in social psychology, some laypeople tend to think along similar essentialist lines. The main aim of this article is to highlight a number of processes that possibly explain the persistent presence and popularity of essentialist conceptions of mental disorders. One such process is the general tendency of laypeople to essentialize conceptual structures, including biological, social, and psychiatric categories. Another process involves the allure of biological psychiatry. Advocating a categorical and biological approach, this strand of psychiatry probably reinforced the already existing lay essentialism about mental disorders.

The diagnoses are scientifically established with good validity, specificity, sensitivity and inter-rater reliability. Similarly the treatments are established through scientific research. However, sometimes medical illnesses may present with symptoms seemingly pointing to a psychiatric origin. Making a misdiagnosis can be quite problematic and dangerous for the patient. The opposite is also true, that psychiatric illnesses may present with symptoms implying a medical diagnostic origin. Finally, psychiatric patients may have more than one psychiatric diagnosis and in addition, a medical diagnosis too. A high degree of suspicion should always be entertained by the diagnosing physician, psychiatric or non-psychiatric. This paper reviews the literature regarding these situations and then presents several clinical cases where this conundrum was present. Making the correct diagnosis was critical in the successful treatment outcome of each of the clinical cases. When asked to consult on a patient by non-psychiatric physicians, the psychiatrist must be careful to also look for non-psychiatric origins for the referring symptoms.

We aimed to identify specific variants underlying genetic effects shared between the five disorders in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium: autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia.\nWe analysed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for the five disorders in 33,332 cases and 27,888 controls of European ancestory. To characterise allelic effects on each disorder, we applied a multinomial logistic regression procedure with model selection to identify the best-fitting model of relations between genotype and phenotype. We examined cross-disorder effects of genome-wide significant loci previously identified for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and used polygenic risk-score analysis to examine such effects from a broader set of common variants. We undertook pathway analyses to establish the biological associations underlying genetic overlap for the five disorders. We used enrichment analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to assess whether SNPs with cross-disorder association were enriched for regulatory SNPs in post-mortem brain-tissue samples.\nSNPs at four loci surpassed the cutoff for genome-wide significance (p<5\u00d710(-8)) in the primary analysis: regions on chromosomes 3p21 and 10q24, and SNPs within two L-type voltage-gated calcium channel subunits, CACNA1C and CACNB2. Model selection analysis supported effects of these loci for several disorders. Loci previously associated with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia had variable diagnostic specificity. Polygenic risk scores showed cross-disorder associations, notably between adult-onset disorders. Pathway analysis supported a role for calcium channel signalling genes for all five disorders. Finally, SNPs with evidence of cross-disorder association were enriched for brain eQTL markers.\nOur findings show that specific SNPs are associated with a range of psychiatric disorders of childhood onset or adult onset. In particular, variation in calcium-channel activity genes seems to have pleiotropic effects on psychopathology. These results provide evidence relevant to the goal of moving beyond descriptive syndromes in psychiatry, and towards a nosology informed by disease cause.\nNational Institute of Mental Health."}, {"Title": "First-onset psychosis, anti-NMDAR encephalitis, schizophrenia and Consultation-Liaison psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis is a new, severe and possibly life-threatening disorder as illustrated by a 25% mortality or severe disability rate.

The ATP data (video of the interview and patient history) were forwarded for psychiatric consultation and a diagnostic assessment by the investigators. The ATP data were then examined separately by two Spanish-speaking psychiatrists, before being translated into English and then re-examined by two English-speaking psychiatrists. Agreement between the expert diagnoses of the investigators and the diagnoses from the Spanish consultations, the Spanish-to-English translated consultations, and the SCID-I results was assessed using kappa statistics.\nWe found acceptable levels of agreement for major diagnostic groupings among the Spanish- and English-speaking psychiatrists. Kappa values for diagnostic agreement between the expert and the translated consultations, the original language consultations, and the SCID-I were at least 0.52 (percentage agreement, 79%) and higher.\nATP consultations in Spanish, and those translated from Spanish to English, are feasible, and broad diagnostic reliability was achieved.

This study investigated the nature and prevalence of psychopathology in a sample of stranger and acquaintance stalkers and whether psychopathology was associated with increased duration or serial stalking in this group. It was hypothesised that mental illness, and specifically psychosis, would be more prevalent among strangers and acquaintances than among ex-intimate stalkers.\nTwo hundred and eleven stalkers (10% female; mean age = 35, SD = 10.8; 71 ex-intimates) were recruited between 2002 and 2007 from a specialist service in Melbourne, Australia. Each underwent psychiatric and psychological assessment and disorders were diagnosed according to DMS-IV-TR criteria. Non-parametric independent sample tests were used to examine associations between relationship type and psychopathology, and to identify individual and stalking-related characteristics associated with increased duration and serial stalking.\nAxis I disorders were significantly more prevalent among strangers and acquaintances than ex-intimates (71% vs 48%, OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.4 to 4.7), as were psychotic disorders (29% vs 9%, OR = 4.4, 95% CI = 1.8 to 10.9). Psychosis was significantly associated with increased duration of stalking behaviour (U = 3043, p < 0.001). Those with a personality disorder were twice as likely to have stalked multiple times (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.2 to 5.0).\nThose who stalk strangers and acquaintances are often mentally ill and psychopathology is associated with more persistent and recurrent stalking behaviour. Although limited by the use of clinical interview rather than structured assessment, these findings strongly support the argument for routine mental health assessment of stranger and acquaintance stalkers who become involved with the criminal justice system."}, {"Title": "Mental health knowledge and attitudes in a transition year student group: a pilot survey.", "Abstract": "Introduction Stigma towards mental health disorders remains a significant problem in society.

The input was from psychiatry and allied health professionals covering a wide range of mental health topics. It was administered before the first session and immediately after the last session. The input for each group in terms of topics was almost identical.\nIn all, 24 students participated, and the majority had either gone to school with, had observed in passing, or had a friend of the family or a relative with a mental illness, although only 21% had had knowledge on mental illness up to the intervention. The post-intervention scores demonstrated that the week had an impact on most of these views. Their attitudes to individuals with mental illness as regards employment, treatment, assistance, and recovery were encouraging, even at baseline, and all their responses improved following the sessions. There was a view that those with mental illness were somewhat reluctant to seek professional help.\nAlthough the results of this study are very encouraging as regards attitudes towards mental health and their response to education, far more research and interventions are needed to explore and address stigma in more detail."}, {"Title": "Use of codeine-containing medicines by Irish psychiatric inpatients before and after regulatory limitations on their supply.", "Abstract": "In recent years, concerns have been highlighted in several jurisdictions, including Ireland, regarding abuse of over-the-counter codeine-containing medicines.

To this end, the law employs a procedural test of capacity that excludes substantive judgments about patients' decisions. However, clinical intuitions about patients' capacity to make decisions about their treatment often conflict with a strict reading of the legal criteria for assessing capacity, particularly in psychiatry. In this article I argue that this tension arises because the procedural conception of capacity is inadequate and does not reflect the clinical or legal realities of assessing capacity. I propose that conceptualising capacity as having 'recognisable reasons' for a treatment decision provides a practical way of legitimately incorporating both procedural and substantive elements of decision-making into assessments of capacity."}, {"Title": "[Report of Internal Consistency of the Scales in Research Published in the Colombian Journal of Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Establishment of the frequency of reporting internal consistency of the scales in research published in the Colombian Journal of Psychiatry (CJP) between 2006 and 2010.\nA descriptive study was carried out which computes the report of internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) of scales in research published as original papers in the CJP.

The first category manifests itself through practices such as: Taking care of the diseased person by being physically present, providing physical or emotional support, or by transferring care-related actions to other family members. Two main perspectives could be identified in the second category, namely: the caretaker's perspective and that of the person being taken care of. Two tendencies were found regarding the first one: taking care of others brings about transformations in the caretakers and taking care of others is tough. The second perspective has the same number of tendencies: self-care as poetics and taking care of oneself in order to go from the Diving Bell to the Butterfly.\nTaking care of others is a way of building humanity.

It has been hypothesized that schizophrenia patients carrying particular risk genes might be more sensitive to the psychosis-inducing effects of cannabis than other patients and healthy test subjects. Here we review the effects of cannabinoids on a mutant mouse model for the schizophrenia candidate gene neuregulin 1 (Nrg1). The studies suggest a complex interaction between cannabis and Nrg1: the neuro-behavioral effects of cannabinoids were different in Nrg1 mutant and control mice and depended on exposure time, sex, and age of test animals. This research provides the first evidence of complex cannabis-Nrg1 interactions suggesting Nrg1 as a prime target for future clinical investigations. Furthermore, it highlights that animal model research can broaden our understanding of the complex multi-factorial etiology of schizophrenia.

Psychostimulants could have an earlier onset of action. This assumption is based on the 'vigilance regulation model of mania' which postulates that vigilance is unstable in manic patients.

These skills include social stimuli processing, drawing inferences about others' mental states, and engaging in social interactions. In recent years, there has been growing evidence of social cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia. Apparently, these impairments are separable from general neurocognitive impairments, such as attention, memory, and executive functioning. Moreover, social cognition seems to be a main determinant of functional outcome and could be used as a guide to elaborate new pharmacological and psychological treatments. However, most of these studies focus on individual mechanisms and observational perspectives; only few of them study schizophrenic patients during interactive situations. We first review evidences of social cognitive impairments both in social stimuli processing and in mental state attribution. We focus on the relationship between these functions and both general cognitive impairments and functional outcome. We next review recent game theory approaches to the study of how social engagement occurs in schizophrenic patients. The advantage of using game theory is that game-oriented tasks can assess social decision making in an interactive everyday situation model. Finally, we review proposed theoretical models used to explain social alterations and their underlying biological mechanisms. Based on interactive studies, we propose a framework which takes into account the dynamic nature of social processes. Thus, understanding social skills as a result of dynamical systems could facilitate the development of both basic research and clinical applications oriented to psychiatric populations."}, {"Title": "Are microglia minding us? Digging up the unconscious mind-brain relationship from a neuropsychoanalytic approach.", "Abstract": "The unconscious mind-brain relationship remains unresolved. From the perspective of neuroscience, neuronal networks including synapses have been dominantly believed to play crucial roles in human mental activities, while glial contribution to mental activities has long been ignored. Recently, it has been suggested that microglia, glial cells with immunological/inflammatory functions, play important roles in psychiatric disorders. Newly revealed microglial roles, such as constant direct contact with synapses even in the normal brain, have defied the common traditional belief that microglia do not contribute to neuronal networks. Recent human neuroeconomic investigations with healthy volunteers using minocycline, an antibiotic with inhibitory effects on microglial activation, suggest that microglia may unconsciously modulate human social behaviors as \"noise.\" We herein propose a novel unconscious mind structural system in the brain centering on microglia from a neuropsychoanalytic approach. At least to some extent, microglial activation in the brain may activate unconscious drives as \"psychological immune memory/reaction\" in the mind, and result in various emotions, traumatic reactions, psychiatric symptoms including suicidal behaviors, and (psychoanalytic) transference during interpersonal relationships.

A central assumption of this investigation was that the factor structure of the Parents' Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (PISMI) scale would be similar to the factor structure of the ISMI scale. A total of 194 parents of persons with SMI completed the PISMI scale. The results revealed that the PISMI scale has high internal consistency and that it is made up of three distinctive factors: discrimination experience, social withdrawal and alienation, and stereotype endorsement. These factors are similar, but not identical, to the factors that underlie the ISMI scale. This study's findings also indicate that parents' prominent reaction to self-stigma is stereotype endorsement."}, {"Title": "Gene-environment interaction in panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder.", "Abstract": "Gene-environment interaction is a form of causal interplay, whereby genetic effects on phenotypic variation change as a function of environmental exposure. While conceptually appealing, there is still much debate on the veracity and the relevance of this form of etiological interdependence for psychiatric disorders. By focusing on panic disorder (PD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), this article outlines why gene-environment interaction is controversial, why it can be important for both researchers and clinicians, and how it is investigated by quantitative genetic, molecular genetic, and genomic strategies. It is suggested that gene-environment interaction effects are more reliable and meaningful when they can be harnessed to pinpoint specific biological pathways and mechanisms. In psychiatry, this can be guided by phenotypic dissection and realized by adopting intermediate phenotypes of a physiological nature, such as carbon dioxide sensitivity for PD, or gene expression profiling after stress for PTSD.

While the DSM-5 is essentially for the membership of the American Psychiatric Association, its impact will be felt far beyond the boundaries of psychiatry and that of the United States of America. However, its atheoretical approach, despite its pretensions, pushes a purely biomedical agenda to the exclusion of other approaches to mental health and illness. Nevertheless, the DSM-5 should serve a gate-keeping function, which intends to set minimum standards. It is work in progress and will continue to evolve with the generation of new evidence.

Psychiatry lacks a definition of mental disorder that covers all situations, there are difficulties in drawing a precise distinction between normality and psychopathology, and the majority of these &#8220;diagnostic&#8221; categories are not validated by biological criteria. Furthermore, there is still a debate on the nature of the symptoms of mental disorders, a confusion classification and diagnosis and a preoccupation with the growing inflation of diagnostic categories. Dualism is at the core of psychopathology, simply because Cartesian dualism led to the development of modern science, but the price paid includes the split-up of mental and physical phenomena and illnesses and of psychiatry and the rest of medicine. Localizationism, that is, the approach to brain function considering that particular pychological functions are carried out by particular brain areas or centers, helps to understand many clinical and psychological phenomena, but have largely fild in explaining the nature of most mental disorders.

Amotivational syndrome as a paradigm of negative symptoms in substance abuse.", "Abstract": "Negative symptoms, conceptualized as clinical manifestations of schizophrenia, and subsequently described in other psychiatric disorders, include the loss of normal arousal, drive and affective reactivity. In the field of substance abuse, an interesting analogy can be detected between negative symptoms, in their classical meaning, and the amotivational syndrome (AS), which has been described as a form of chronic cannabis intoxication. AS also shows a close resemblance to the reward deficiency syndrome (RDS) of alcoholics and stimulant abusers, and to the post-withdrawal syndrome (PWS) of detoxified heroin addicts. A variety of substances share a common tropism for the dopaminergic system, leading to a state of hypophoria, which seems to represent a common pathway for chronic substance abusers. In the light of these convergences, a common treatment principle for addictive disorders can be enunciated. This consists in resorting to pro-dopaminergic drugs, that are supposed to replace damaged functions and control craving, and in avoiding anti-dopaminergic drugs, that are expected to exacerbate craving and impede the reversal of the reward deficiency."}, {"Title": "Posttraumatic stress disorder and impaired autonomic modulation in male twins.", "Abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been linked to increased morbidity. An inflexibility of the autonomic nervous system might be the underlying mechanism. We aimed to assess whether PTSD and combat trauma exposure are associated with lower heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic function and a predictor of death.\nWe measured HRV by power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram in 459 middle-aged veteran male twins. Combat trauma was assessed with the combat exposure scale, and current and remitted PTSD was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders. Mixed-effects regression models were used to test associations of PTSD and HRV between and within twin pairs.\nOf all twins, 211 had combat exposure, 31 had current PTSD, and 43 had remitted PTSD. Current PTSD was inversely associated with very-low-frequency and low-frequency HRV both in individual twins and within 20 pairs discordant for current PTSD. Twins with current PTSD had a 49% lower low-frequency HRV than their brothers without PTSD (p<.001). Remitted PTSD was not associated with HRV. Results were robust to adjustment for depression and other risk factors. Combat exposure was inversely associated with most HRV frequencies, but this association mostly diminished after adjustment for current PTSD.\nIn middle-aged veteran men, combat exposure and current PTSD are associated with measures of autonomic inflexibility previously shown to have prognostic significance. The negative health impact of combat exposure on autonomic function is mediated largely through PTSD and might reverse with remission of PTSD."}, {"Title": "Implementing transnational telemedicine solutions: a connected health project in rural and remote areas of six Northern Periphery countries Series on European collaborative projects.", "Abstract": "This is the first article in a Series on collaborative projects between European countries, relevant for general practice/family medicine and primary healthcare. Telemedicine, in particular the use of the Internet, videoconferencing and handheld devices such as smartphones, holds the potential for further strides in the application of technology for the delivery of healthcare, particularly to communities in rural and remote areas within and without the European Union where this study is taking place. The Northern Periphery Programme has funded the 'Implementing Transnational Telemedicine Solutions' (ITTS) project from September 2011 to December 2013, led by the Centre for Rural Health in Inverness, Scotland. Ten sustainable projects based on videoconsultation (speech therapy, renal services, emergency psychiatry, diabetes), mobile patient self-management (physical activity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease) and home-based health services (medical and social care emergencies, rehabilitation, multi-morbidity) are being implemented by the six partner countries: Scotland, Finland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Norway and Sweden. In addition, an International Telemedicine Advisory Service, created for the project, provides business expertise and advice. Community panels contribute feedback on the design and implementation of services and ensure 'user friendliness'. The project goals are to improve accessibility of healthcare in rural and remote communities, reducing unnecessary hospital visits and travel in a sustainable way. Opportunities will be provided for comparative research studies. This article provides an introduction to the ITTS project and how it aims to fulfil these needs.

However, how ambivalence contributes to understanding and treating some important psychiatric disorders has not been well defined. This article reviews Bleuler's original use of the concept, as well as contributions by Freud and other theorists, as background. The author proposes that mastery of ambivalence-depolarization of the primary drive expressions of love and hate so that a degree of ambivalence toward a loved object can be tolerated-is a fundamental developmental task. The significant role that ambivalence plays in some major psychiatric disorders-schizophrenia, borderline personality, and depression-is illustrated with case material and discussed."}, {"Title": "Borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder: Practical differential diagnosis.", "Abstract": "The challenge of accurate diagnosis remains at the heart of good psychiatric treatment. In the current state of psychiatry, a confluence of forces has increased this challenge for the clinician. These include practical pressures-such as limited time for diagnostic evaluation, the question of what is reimbursed by insurance, and the issue of directing patients to acute treatments-and also trends in nosology, such as the descriptive focus on signs and symptoms in the current official diagnostic system. The authors offer observations that we hope will help clinicians who have to make difficult diagnostic differentiations often under pressured circumstances. The paper is motivated both by the high frequency of diagnostic errors observed under such conditions and also by the belief that considering symptoms in the context of the patient's sense of self, quality of interpersonal relations, and level of functioning over time will help guide the diagnostic process."}, {"Title": "Post-disaster Gulf Coast recovery using telehealth.", "Abstract": "The Gulf Coast continues to struggle with service need far outpacing available resources. Since 2005, the Regional Coordinating Center for Hurricane Response (RCC) at Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, has supported telehealth solutions designed to meet high service needs (e.g., psychiatry) within primary care and other healthcare organizations. The overall RCC vision is to support autonomous, useful, and sustainable telehealth programs towards mitigating unmet disaster-related needs.\nTo assess Gulf Coast telehealth experiences, we conducted semistructured interviews with both regional key informants and national organizations with Gulf Coast recovery interests. Using qualitative-descriptive analysis, interview transcripts were analyzed to identify shared development themes.\nThirty-eight key informants were interviewed, representing a 77.6% participation rate among organizations engaged by the RCC. Seven elements critical to telehealth success were identified: Funding, Regulatory, Workflow, Attitudes, Personnel, Technology, and Evaluation. These key informant accounts reveal shared insights with telehealth regarding successes, challenges, and recommendations.\nThe seven elements critical to telehealth success both confirm and organize development principles from a diverse collective of healthcare stakeholders. The structured nature of these insights suggests a generalizable framework upon which other organizations might develop telehealth strategies toward addressing high service needs with limited resources."}, {"Title": "Clinical neuropsychology within adolescent and young-adult psychiatry: conceptualizing theory and practice.", "Abstract": "Historically, clinical neuropsychology has made significant contributions to the understanding of brain-behavior relationships, particularly in neurological conditions. During the past several decades, neuropsychology has also become established as an important discipline in psychiatric settings. Cognition is increasingly recognized as being core to psychiatric illnesses and predictive of functional outcomes, augmenting theories regarding symptomatology and illness progression. Adult-type psychiatric disorders (including schizophrenia and other psychotic, mood, anxiety, eating, substance-related, and personality disorders) typically emerge during adolescence or young adulthood, a critical neurodevelopmental period. Clinical neuropsychological assessment in adolescent psychiatric patients is particularly valuable in informing clinical formulation and intervention and can be therapeutic across a number of levels. This article articulates the theoretical considerations and practical challenges and applications of clinical neuropsychology within adolescent and young-adult psychiatry. The importance of considering the neurodevelopmental context and its relationship to current theoretical models underpinning clinical practice are discussed."}, {"Title": "Baby on board: pregnancy as a source of conflict for the psychiatry registrar.", "Abstract": "A literature review explores the author's experience of conflict while working as a psychiatry registrar during her pregnancy.\nConflicts may arise during a registrar's pregnancy, but can be mediated through effective supervision and peer support, and may benefit future clinical practice with the development of new insights and enhanced self-awareness."}, {"Title": "'Admit voluntary, schedule if tries to leave': placing Mental Health Acts in the context of mental health law and human rights.", "Abstract": "Most postgraduate training for clinicians in Australia and New Zealand regarding mental health legislation focuses on the relevant Mental Health Acts (MHAs) rather than the broader principles of mental health law. Key concepts include treatment in the least restrictive environment, voluntary access to mental health services, treatability, reciprocity and due process.

Also discussed are age and sex distribution.\nSince 2009 the following information has been recorded anonymously twice a year from each patient at the participating hospitals of KinderAGATE: age, sex, leading diagnosis, prescribed medication and dosage. The data obtained provide an excellent epidemiological basis for the observation of the prescription practice in child and adolescent psychiatry.\nIn 2010, 8.4 % of the patients included were treated for a depressive disorder at the KinderAGATE hospitals. This is only a small portion compared to the rates found in adult psychiatry (25.8 % of patients). In our sample male patients diagnosed with depression (58 % DPat, mean age 13.8 years) were treated more often and earlier than female patients (42 % DPat, mean age 15.3 years). Fluoxetine and mirtazapine were the most frequently prescribed substances. Sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram were also prescribed.\nA reserved medical treatment can be observed in child and adolescence psychiatry. Off-label use seems to be nearly unavoidable due to the lack of newly authorized medicine. Moreover, the numerous prescriptions for fluoxetine, the only SSRI currently approved for this age group in Germany, lead to the question of possible unauthorized alternatives."}, {"Title": "\"Dictating the suitable way of life\": mental hygiene for children and workers in socialist Mexico, 1934-1940.", "Abstract": "After the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920), an ambitious project of national reconstruction began in which education and health were two priorities in the consolidation of a new nation. In this context of social, cultural, and political transformation, mental hygiene was a field that made it possible to articulate the professional practice of psychiatrists with the project of the nation promoted by postrevolutionary governments. In Mexico, the mental hygiene movement was headed by the same doctors who professionalized the practice of psychiatry and made it a specialized field of knowledge.

This paper examines a historical case in psychiatry where the debate about how to define evidence was of central importance to nosological decision making. During the fourth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders a controversial decision was made to exclude postpartum depression (PPD) as a distinct disorder from the manual. On the basis of archival and interview data, I argue that the fundamental issues driving this decision were related to questions about what constituted suitable hierarchies of evidence and appropriate definitions of evidence. Further, although potentially buttressed by the evidence-based medicine movement, this shift toward a reliance on particular kinds of empirical evidence occurred when the dominant paradigm in American psychiatry changed from a psychodynamic approach to a research-based medical model."}, {"Title": "The use of emergency psychiatric medication: a survey from 21 countries.", "Abstract": "The article presents international survey results from experts recruited through the European Violence in Psychiatry Research Group on the use of emergency psychiatric medication for the treatment of violence and aggression.

However, clinicians now recognize that racial differences may contribute to altered therapeutic response and tolerability. This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of IM ziprasidone versus IM haloperidol for the management of agitation in Chinese subjects with schizophrenia. Subjects with acute schizophrenia were randomized to either ziprasidone (n = 189, 10 to 20 mg as required up to a maximum of 40 mg/d) or haloperidol (n = 187, 5 mg every 4 to 8 hours to a maximum of 20 mg/d) for 3 days.

The MedLine, PsychInfo, Cochrane and CINAHL databases were searched for journal articles about nursing care in the adult inpatient setting. A qualitative content analysis approach was used to indentify nursing interventions in the articles. About 84% of the statements (terms and definitions) are encompassed by the interventions listed by the NIC. Very few interventions need to be added to the NIC classification or necessitate a reorganization of the taxonomy.

The exposure cohort (mean age = 47.9 years, standard deviation = 17.3 years) consisted of 59,647 patients using benzodiazepine. Each patient from the exposure cohort was randomly frequency matched by age and sex to a person from the cohort with no benzodiazepine exposure (the comparison group; mean age = 46.4 years, standard deviation = 17.8 years). Each study subject was followed until a diagnosis of cancer was made (according to the International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision Clinical Modification) or until the time the subject was censored for loss to follow-up, death, or termination of insurance, or to the end of 2009. A Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was conducted to estimate the effects of benzodiazepine use on cancer risk. In the group with benzodiazepine use, the overall risk of developing cancer was 19% higher than in the group without benzodiazepine exposure, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.19; 99.6% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.32).

We included 16 patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) who served as a patient control group, in addition to 22 healthy control subjects. Non-credible test performance was detected using a Symptom Validity Test (SVT). Psychopathology was also assessed.\nApart from a worse performance on a verbal memory task, no evidence of neuropsychological impairments was found in our PMD sample. Interestingly however, patients with PMD reported more cognitive complaints in daily life and performed worse on the SVT than the two other groups. Patients with GTS did not report, or show, cognitive impairments. In patients with PMD, we found associations between verbal learning, SVT performance and severity of depression and anxiety complaints.\nWe conclude that some patients with PMD show non-credible cognitive symptoms. In contrast, no evident cognitive impairments were present in patients with PMD or GTS. Our study underlines the importance of assessment of non-credible response in patients with PMD.

While western researchers search for new treatments and novel mechanisms of action, investigators in Asia are analyzing traditional remedies in order to understand the mechanisms responsible for their effectiveness. A review of contemporary pharmacologic studies of agents used in TCM for psychiatric indications reveals that virtually all of the active principles of drug action established in 20th century psychopharmacology were encountered empirically in Chinese herbal medicine over the past 2000 years. Building bridges between these two traditions may thus be of benefit to both cultures.

The most pronounced risk markers for behavior problems were severity of ID, autism, night sleep disturbances, sensory hypersensitivity, communication dysfunction, social deficits, psychiatry involvement, and psychotropic medication. About 50% of people with behavior problems were on psychotropic drugs. Protective markers were Down's syndrome and, to some extent, cerebral palsy.

Their mothers and teachers evaluated them with a DSM-IV-referenced rating scale.\nCorrelations between schizoid personality symptoms and ASD social skills deficits were moderate to large, and this was true for children with ASD and Controls, regardless of ADHD status, and for mother's and teachers' ratings. Conversely, severity of hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking were minimally correlated with ASD severity with the exception of Controls with ADHD. The disorganized behavior and negative symptoms of schizophrenia evidenced the strongest pattern of associations with ASD symptoms, and this was particularly true for children with co-morbid ADHD (\u00b1ASD, all three ASD symptom dimensions), and for teachers' ratings of all four groups. Nevertheless, there was considerable variability in relations for specific symptoms across informants and groups. Correlations between SSD symptom severity and IQ were generally low, particularly among the ASD Only group and for all teacher-rated symptoms.\nAssociations between ASD and SSD symptoms were often dimension-specific, and this was particularly evident in children without ADHD (\u00b1ASD; mothers' ratings).

The objectives of the conference were to discuss some of the occupational impairments adults with ADHD may face and how to address these problems from an inclusive perspective. Furthermore the conference looked at influencing policy and decision making at a political level to address impaired occupational functioning in adults with ADHD and fears around employing people with disabilities in general.\nThe consensus was that there were clear weaknesses in the current arrangements in the UK and internationally to address occupational difficulties. More so, Occupational Health was not wholly integrated and used as a means of making positive changes to the workplace, but rather as a superfluous last resort that employers tried to avoid. Furthermore the lack of cross professional collaboration on occupational functioning in adults with ADHD was a significant problem.\nFuture research needs to concentrate on further investigating occupational functioning in adults with ADHD and pilot exploratory initiatives and tools, leading to a better and more informed understanding of possible barriers to employment and potential schemes to put in place to address these problems."}, {"Title": "Screening for suicidal ideation and attempts among emergency department medical patients: instrument and results from the Psychiatric Emergency Research Collaboration.", "Abstract": "Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goal 15 calls for organizations \"to identify patients at risk for suicide.\" Overt suicidal behavior accounts for 0.6% of emergency department (ED) visits, but incidental suicidal ideation is found in 3%-11.6%.

Patients were predominantly young men (median age 25 years, 79 % men) with a history of multiple substance abuse. Ten patients had only a former use of LE, the other nine patients used it at the time of presentation. Of these, every third patient had to be transiently treated in an intermediate care unit, usually because of very severe and sudden withdrawal symptoms. Otherwise, detoxification was possible in psychiatry, but often required high doses of benzodiazepines. Three patients met the criteria for dependence from GBL.\nIn recent years, a small number of users of LE is seen also in general psychiatry, The problem is rather the severity of withdrawal than the number of cases. Close cooperation with intermediate care units is needed. In any case of coma of unknown origin or delirium with sudden onset LE use or withdrawal has to be taken into consideration, respectively. Many clinical problems result from the fact that LE cannot be detected in routine drug screenings. According to our experience, withdrawal from LE can be controlled with benzodiazepines."}, {"Title": "De Martino's concept of critical ethnocentrism and its relevance to transcultural psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Ethnography and hermeneutics help us think of the clinical encounter as a meeting of cultures. In this paper, we examine Ernesto De Martino's concept of critical ethnocentrism and its relevance for psychiatry, arguing for the necessity of a cultural self-assessment on the part of the clinician as a means of optimizing analyses of the patient's culture. Conceptualizing the clinician as an \"ethnologist,\" we argue that clinicians should be able to describe and acknowledge patients' cultural backgrounds, while remaining aware of their own culturally rooted prejudices. Focusing on the case of persons affected by schizophrenia, we suggest that De Martino's work invites an openness to hermeneutic dialogue that aims for the coconstruction of shared narratives by clinician and patient."}, {"Title": "An update on amine oxidase inhibitors: multifaceted drugs.", "Abstract": "Although not used as extensively as other antidepressants for the treatment of depression, the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors continue to hold a niche in psychiatry and to have a relatively broad spectrum with regard to treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders. Experimental and clinical research on MAO inhibitors has been expanding in the past few years, primarily because of exciting findings indicating that these drugs have neuroprotective properties (often independently of their ability to inhibit MAO). The non-selective and irreversible MAO inhibitors tranylcypromine (TCP) and phenelzine (PLZ) have demonstrated neuroprotective properties in numerous studies targeting elements of apoptotic cascades and neurogenesis. l-Deprenyl and rasagiline, both selective MAO-B inhibitors, are used in the management of Parkinson's disease, but these drugs may be useful in the treatment of other neurodegenerative disorders given that they demonstrate neuroprotective/neurorescue properties in a wide variety of models in vitro and in vivo. Although the focus of studies on the involvement of MAO inhibitors in neuroprotection has been on MAO-B inhibitors, there is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that MAO-A inhibitors may also have neuroprotective properties. In addition to MAO inhibition, PLZ also inhibits primary amine oxidase (PrAO), an enzyme implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These multifaceted aspects of amine oxidase inhibitors and some of their metabolites are reviewed herein."}, {"Title": "[The demand for psychiatric care for the elderly].", "Abstract": "This article marks the launch of a new section devoted to geriatric psychiatry.This multi-disciplinary approach encompasses elderly people suffering from psychological difficulties or a confirmed psychiatric disorder, with or without an associated dementia condition.

Different from Petras et al. (2004a, 2005), the outcome used in this study included serious antisocial behavior in young adulthood as well as in adolescence. Among males, the use of multiple time points did not yield greater classification accuracy than the highest single time points, that is, third and fifth grades. For females, although fifth grade represented the best single time point in terms of classification accuracy, no significant association was found between earlier time points and the later outcome, rendering a test of the multiple time points hypothesis moot. The findings presented in this study have strong implications for the design of targeted intervention for violence prevention, indicating that the screening quality based on aggression ratings during the elementary years is rather modest, particularly for females."}, {"Title": "Clinical symptoms of psychotic episodes and 25-hydroxy vitamin D serum levels in black first-generation immigrants.", "Abstract": "Dark-skinned immigrants have a higher risk for schizophrenia and other psychoses than other immigrants. The first British studies reported that first-generation immigrants (FGIs) from the Caribbean presented atypical psychoses. This study examines the characteristics of psychotic episodes in black FGIs to Canada.\nThe charts of 18 FGIs from Africa and Haiti, extracted from a series of 20 black patients consecutively admitted to Psychiatry, were retrospectively reviewed regarding clinical features, diagnoses and vitamin D levels.\nYoung FGIs presented acute psychotic episodes with abrupt onset, florid positive symptoms, few negative symptoms and good evolution. The onset was more insidious in older FGIs. Overall, catatonia was very frequent (28%), and mood symptoms still more frequent (44%). No cognitive decline was observed during follow-up. Serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D were in the insufficiency range. Supplementation at 1000 IU/day did not restore normal levels.\nThe clinical features of psychotic episodes in black FGIs are similar to those reported in dark-skinned FGIs to other countries. They are also observed in other immigrants and in non-immigrants. These atypical psychoses are possibly related to a recent vitamin D deficit. This hypothesis should be tested by clinical trials of sufficient vitamin D supplementation."}, {"Title": "[Comorbidity of depression with other psychiatric disorders in adolescents: about 77 cases].", "Abstract": "In adolescents diagnosed with depressive disorders, psychiatric comorbidity is rather the rule than the exception.\nTo find the prevalence of the association between depression in adolescents and other psychiatric disorders and second and to study the different mental disorders comorbid to depression.\nWe conducted a descriptive, retrospective and analytic survey carried on 77 subjects having been followed in the child psychiatry department of Sfax for depressive disorders diagnosed according to the DSM-IV TR criteria during a period of 9 years (from January 1st 1998 till 31st December 2006)\n49.3% of the youths with depression had comorbid conditions: anxiety disorders in 23.37% of cases, disruptive disorders in 13% of cases (conduct disorders in 11.7 % of cases and oppositional defiant disorders in 1.3 % of cases), personality disorders in 13% of cases, substance abuse in 3.9% of cases and alimentary behavior disturbances in 2.6% of cases.

Lower rates of leverage are reported in the UK compared to the USA, possibly due to differences between the US and European social welfare systems. These differences raise questions as to the international comparability of leverage practices described in the literature. The study aimed to capture patients' experiences and perceptions of pressures and to explore (a) whether \"leverage\" can be distinguished from other pressures, and (b) how a concept of leverage derived from patient experiences in England might fit with the literature to date. In this article we present the different types of pressure that we identified from patients' accounts, and a set of criteria derived for the purpose of distinguishing between these different types of pressure.\nTwenty-nine qualitative interviews with a purposive subsample from a study of leverage in the English mental health system were analysed.\nParticipants reported a range of what can be classified as both leveraged and non-leveraged pressures. These were perceived as pressures to adhere to treatment, as well as \"staying well.\" Leveraged pressures were distinguishable from non-leveraged pressures by the presence of three features: conditionality, a lever and direct communication.\nThe portrayal of \"leverage\" in the current literature does not fully capture patient experiences of pressure. Our analysis offers a clearer concept of leverage and other pressures that influence patients, and which may have different legal, ethical and clinical implications."}, {"Title": "Conversation with Juan Carlos Negrete.", "Abstract": "Juan Carlos Negrete is Emeritus Professor of Psychiatry, McGill University; Founding Director, Addictions Unit, Montreal General Hospital; former President, Canadian Society of Addiction Medicine; and former WHO/PAHO Consultant on Alcoholism, Drug Addiction and Mental Health."}, {"Title": "How to use the ADI-R for classifying autism spectrum disorders?

These structural and functional brain changes are frequently found in multiple, discrete brain areas and may include frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices as well as subcortical brain areas. However, while the structural and functional brain changes in patients are found in anatomically separated areas, these are connected through (long distance) fibers, together forming networks. Thus, instead of representing separate (patho)-physiological entities, these local changes in the brains of patients with psychiatric disorders may in fact represent different parts of the same 'elephant', i.e., the (altered) brain network. Recent developments in quantitative analysis of complex networks, based largely on graph theory, have revealed that the brain's structure and functions have features of complex networks. Here we briefly introduce several recent developments in neural network studies relevant for psychiatry, including from the 2013 special issue on Neural Networks in Psychiatry in European Neuropsychopharmacology. We conclude that new insights will be revealed from the neural network approaches to brain imaging in psychiatry that hold the potential to find causes for psychiatric disorders and (preventive) treatments in the future."}, {"Title": "Future viable models of psychiatry drug discovery in pharma.", "Abstract": "The unmet need for the treatment of disorders of the nervous system is growing, and as highlighted in the media and elsewhere, the results of an aging population will ensure this continues with an upward trajectory.

This current review explores the varied thyroid abnormalities frequently encountered among patients on lithium therapy and their management, since lithium is still a fundamental and widely drug used in psychiatry and Internal Medicine.\nPubMed database and Google scholar were used to search for relevant English language articles relating to lithium therapy and thyroid abnormalities up to December 2012. The search terms used were lithium treatment, thyroid abnormalities, thyroid dysfunction, goitre, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, thyrotoxicosis, autoimmune thyroiditis, lithium toxicity, treatment of affective disorders and depression and side effects of antipsychotic drugs. Reference lists of the identified articles were further used to identify other studies.\nLithium affects normal thyroid functioning through multiple mechanisms. At the cellular level, it decreases thyroid hormone synthesis and release. It also decreases peripheral deiodination of tetraiodothyronine (T4) or thyroxine by decreasing the activity of type I 5' de-iodinase enzyme. Hypothyroidism and goitre (clinically and/ultrasonographically detected) are the most prevalent thyroid abnormalities among patients on long term lithium therapy. Lithium induced hyperthyroidism is very infrequent. Lithium increases the propensity to thyroid autoimmunity in susceptible individuals due to its effect of augmenting the activity of B lymphocytes and reducing the ratio of circulating suppressor to cytotoxic T cells.\nThyroid function tests (serum thyroid stimulating hormone, free thyroid hormones-T4 and triiodothyronine [T3] concentrations and thyroid auto-antibodies) and assessment of thyroid size clinically and by thyroid ultrasonography ought to be performed among patients initiating lithium therapy at baseline and later annually.

No studies discussed efficacy of MST provided in different treatment settings. Four studies found MST more cost-effective than a comparison treatment, leading to fewer out-of-home placements for youth with serious psychiatric illness or lower treatment costs for youth with poorly controlled diabetes."}, {"Title": "[Extensive conservative treatment of obesity].", "Abstract": "The treatment of obesity is complex due to the multifactorial etiology. A modern therapy concept must therefore be tailored to the individual needs and problems and depends on various factors such as degree of obesity, the presence of physical complications, psychological co-morbidities, any treatment measures the patient underwent up to now as well as on motivational factors. Before deciding on a therapeutic measure a structured multidisciplinary cooperation is essential including psychosomatic medicine/psychiatry/psychotherapy, endocrinology, sports medicine, nutritional medicine and surgery as well. The treatment must be carried out in a multidisciplinary team and includes an adequate therapy of comorbidities and sometimes a psychopharmacological support. The success of a conservative treatment of obesity is remarkable and long-lasting and can be straightforwardly compared to bariatric surgery in financial as well as ethical terms, although for patients and their physicians the latter often carries the allure of quick success."}, {"Title": "Somatic symptoms in consultation-liaison psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In medically ill patients the term 'somatic symptoms' is used to understand those symptoms which cannot be fully understood in the light of existing medical illness(es). These include a number of physical symptoms and also certain clinical syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome among others. However, it is increasingly recognized that such patients have larger degrees of psychological morbidities, especially depressive and anxiety disorders, and have disproportionately elevated rates of medical care utilization, including outpatient visits, hospitalizations and total healthcare costs. In view of this psychological morbidity, significant distress and functional impairment, the role of the consultation-liaison psychiatrist is prominent in the management of these patients. A consultation-liaison (CL) psychiatrist is expected to be part of the primary care team to manage patient with unexplained SS, and at the same time is expected to guide colleagues to practice a patient-centred approach to improve the outcome of patients with such symptoms. The clinical work of a CL psychiatrist involves evaluation of patients with medically unexplained symptoms for probable psychiatric disorders and treatment of psychiatric morbidity and also management of patients without psychiatric morbidity. Management strategies include reattribution, cognitive behaviour therapy and antidepressants, with each strategy showing varying degrees of success."}, {"Title": "First-episode acute and transient psychotic disorder in Latvia: a 6-year follow-up study.", "Abstract": "Acute and transient psychotic disorder (ATPD; F23, ICD-10) is an acute, short-lived psychosis, which has variable prevalence worldwide and has not been extensively studied.\nTo explore the first episode of ATPD in patients in Latvia by describing the clinical features, analyzing the longitudinal changes of diagnosis and associated socio-demographic characteristics.\nRetrospective chart review of all first-time hospitalized patients fulfilling the ICD-10 criteria for ATPD treated at the Riga Centre of Psychiatry and Addiction Disorders, Latvia, during a 3-year period.

Biological factors may be useful biomarkers for treatment with physical activity (PA), and neurobiological effects of PA may herald new therapeutic development in the future. This paper provides a thorough and up-to-date review of studies examining the neuroimmunomodulatory effects of PA on the brain in depression and depression-like behaviors. From a neuroimmune perspective, evidence suggests PA does enhance the beneficial and reduce the detrimental effects of the neuroimmune system. PA appears to increase the following factors: interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6 (acutely), macrophage migration inhibitory factor, central nervous system-specific autoreactive CD4+ T cells, M2 microglia, quiescent astrocytes, CX3CL1, and insulin-like growth factor-1. On the other hand, PA appears to reduce detrimental neuroimmune factors such as: Th1/Th2 balance, pro-inflammatory cytokines, C-reactive protein, M1 microglia, and reactive astrocytes. The effect of other mechanisms is unknown, such as: CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells (T regs), CD200, chemokines, miRNA, M2-type blood-derived macrophages, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 [via receptor 2 (R2)]. The beneficial effects of PA are likely to occur centrally and peripherally (e.g., in visceral fat reduction). The investigation of the neuroimmune effects of PA on depression and depression-like behavior is a rapidly developing and important field."}, {"Title": "Latrepirdine (Dimebon\u00ae), a potential Alzheimer therapeutic, regulates autophagy and neuropathology in an Alzheimer mouse model.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a form of neurodegeneration that develops over the course of multiple decades and as a result of the accumulation of the pathogenic amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide, also known as A4. In late-stage AD, failure of autophagic clearance results in neuronal cell bodies that are almost entirely consumed by autophagic vacuoles (AVs). Previously, we have shown that the potential AD drug latrepirdine (aka Dimebon(\u00ae)), a Russian antihistamine that has shown mixed results in phase II clinical trials in AD, regulates metabolism of the amyloid-\u03b2/A4 precursor protein (APP). In two Molecular Psychiatry papers in 2012, we sought to determine the mechanism through which latrepirdine regulates APP metabolism and to determine, using an Alzheimer mouse model, whether latrepirdine provides protection from the toxicity associated with the accumulation of A\u03b2. In cultured cells, we provided evidence that latrepirdine stimulates MTOR- and ATG5-dependent autophagy, leading to the reduction of intracellular levels of APP metabolites, including A\u03b2. Consistent with this finding, we found that chronic latrepirdine administration resulted in increased levels of the biomarkers thought to correlate with autophagy activation in the brains of TgCRND8 (APP K670M, N671L, V717F) or wild-type mice, and that treatment was associated with abrogation of behavioral deficit, reduction in A\u03b2 neuropathology, and prevention of autophagic failure among TgCRND8 mice."}, {"Title": "The electroconvulsive therapy and anesthesia exercise (ECTAE): the creation of an interdisciplinary learning activity for medical students.", "Abstract": "Demonstration of the effectiveness for medical student teaching of the electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-anesthesia exercise (ECTAE).

There are online pre-exercise and postexercise assessments.\nThird-year medical students reviewed educational reference materials, participated in ECT clinical encounters with both psychiatry and anesthesia, and debriefed after completion of the interdisciplinary exercise. The impact of the exercise was evaluated through online pre- and postexercise assessments. Quantitative and qualitative results for 3 student cohorts (2007 through 2010) were analyzed.\nThirty-eight students participated the study over 3 years.

Thirty of 31 students who completed the program evaluation reported greater comfort level discussing and recommending ECT after participation in ECTAE.\nThe ECTAE is an effective learning activity for medical students, which incorporates cross-disciplinary learning objectives through self-directed exercises, online assessments, and actual clinical experience of ECT. It improves student knowledge of both psychiatry and anesthesia learning objectives, as well as increasing comfort about ECT.

Although a number of antidepressant treatments are available in clinical practice, many patients still undergo multiple and lengthy medication trials before experiencing relief of symptoms. Therefore a tremendous need exists to improve current treatment options and to facilitate more rapid, successful treatment in patients suffering from the deleterious neurobiological effects of ongoing depression. Toward that end, ongoing research is exploring the identification of biomarkers that might be involved in prevention, diagnosis, treatment response, severity, or prognosis of depression. Biomarkers evaluating treatment response will be the focus of this review, given the importance of providing relief to patients in a more expedient and systematic manner. A novel approach to developing such biomarkers of response would incorporate interventions with a rapid onset of action--such as sleep deprivation or intravenous drugs (e.g., ketamine or scopolamine). This alternative translational model for new treatments in psychiatry would facilitate shorter studies, improve feasibility, and increase higher compound throughput testing for these devastating disorders."}, {"Title": "Efficacy of cranial electric stimulation for the treatment of insomnia: a randomized pilot study.", "Abstract": "This pilot study examined the potential efficacy of cranial electric stimulation for the treatment of insomnia.\nThe researchers tested the hypothesis through a randomized, double-blind, and placebo controlled clinical trial.

The researchers identified a nearly significant increase in total time slept after three cranial electric stimulation treatments among all study subjects. A closer examination of this group revealed an interesting gender bias, with men reporting a robust increase in total time slept after one treatment, decay in effect over the next two interventions, and then an increase in total time slept after the fourth treatment.

The second demonstrates that symptoms of made-actions may be caused by abnormalities in the feed-forward motor control system. Both of these models begin at a biological level describing pathological brain processes in neuroscience language but then utilize neuropsychology to 'translate' from brain dysfunction into the mental. Both models break down the pathological pathways into individual subjective elements (particularly misattributing meaning to environmental stimuli and having body parts moved by others) that are understandable because they are common to nearly all of us. The neuropsychology provides hypotheses about the functional and physiological structures underlying familiar subjective experiences. Analyses of disorders of those structures thus provide a scaffold for expanding our empathic understanding of the subjective experiences of those suffering from psychiatric illness."}, {"Title": "The developmental and social history of repetitively aggressive mental health patients.", "Abstract": "A small subgroup of patients is primarily responsible for the large number of aggressive and violent incidents in psychiatric inpatient units. This study aims to identify the developmental, social and interpersonal histories of repeatedly aggressive patients in order to better understand their treatment needs.\nA total of 1269 consecutive inpatients were studied over 18 months, identifying 64 who were repeatedly aggressive; 128 non-aggressive patients were randomly matched to the aggressive patients by age, sex and diagnosis. Developmental, social, interpersonal and familial histories were obtained from a chart review.\nRepeatedly aggressive patients were significantly more likely to have had a history of aggression, physical and sexual abuse, and experienced interpersonal problems and parental divorce.\nAggressive patients do not just need short-term skills training, but interventions that target interpersonal and personality disorder deficits associated with their developmental histories."}, {"Title": "Training psychiatry residents in quality improvement: an integrated, year-long curriculum.", "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE The authors describe a curriculum for psychiatry residents in Quality Improvement (QI) methodology. METHODS All PGY3 residents (N=12) participated in a QI curriculum that included a year-long group project. Knowledge and attitudes were assessed before and after the curriculum, using a modified Quality Improvement Knowledge Assessment Tool (QIKAT) and a QI Self-Assessment survey. RESULTS QIKAT scores were significantly higher for residents after participating in the curriculum when compared with pretest scores. Self-efficacy ratings in QI improved after the course for each item. Residents demonstrated gains in QI skills through participation in the group projects in which they increased rates of depression-screening and monitoring in an outpatient clinic.

We focused on reward anticipation and their neural correlates. Twenty healthy young adults completed the MID and the CID. Additionally, 10 healthy children completed the CID. As expected, both paradigms elicited significant ventral and dorsal striatal activity in young adults during reward anticipation. No differential effects of the tasks on reaction times, accuracy rates or on the total amount of gain were observed. Furthermore, the CID elicited significant ventral striatal activity in healthy children. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate evidence for the validity of the CID paradigm.

Based on this concept of diagnostic sophistication, MMU can be conceptualized dimensionally. Thus, MMU ranges from highly evolved and substantially evidence-validated approaches based on an understanding of the pathophysiological and pathoetiological nature of a disease (e.g., anti-retroviral treatment for HIV, multi-modal treatment of various malignancies), to those based on an understanding of the pathophysiology of an illness (e.g., various treatment combinations used to treat Parkinson's disease), to less evolved or less evidence-based medication combinations based on a syndromic diagnosis (e.g., such as are often used to treat bipolar disorder). By better understanding the principles involved in rational MMU, clinicians can optimize the treatment they provide their patients.

Given the rising numbers of civil detentions in The Netherlands and other European countries, it is important to understand the mechanism behind this association. Our aim is to study the links between opinions about prior psychiatric treatment, insight, service engagement and the risk of (new) civil detentions.\nWe took a random sample of 252 from the 2,682 patients consecutively coming into contact with two psychiatric emergency teams in Amsterdam between September 2004 and September 2006. We recorded socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and information about prior involuntary admissions. We interviewed the patients using the Verona Service Satisfaction Scale (Verona-EU), the Birchwood Insight Scale and the Service Engagement Scale. During a two-year follow-up period we noted their use of mental health care facilities.\nPatients with a satisfactory score on the Verona-EU had significantly lower odds for civil detentions during follow-up compared to patients with a dissatisfactory score on this scale (OR = 0.3). Level of insight did not influence the risk of detention during follow-up. Furthermore, of the 131 patients admitted involuntarily the year before, one-third looked back on their involuntary admission with unambiguous satisfaction.\nMore satisfaction with prior treatment seems to reduce the risk of civil detention remarkably. Low levels of satisfaction seem to be mainly dependent on a history of previous involuntary admission.

However, many drugs in this class cause deleterious metabolic side-effects. Animal models accurately predict metabolic side-effects for SGAs with known clinical metabolic liability. We therefore used preclinical models to evaluate the metabolic side-effects of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance with the novel SGAs asenapine and iloperidone for the first time. Olanzapine was used as a comparator.\nAdults female rats were treated with asenapine (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 mg/kg), iloperidone (0.03, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0 mg/kg) or olanzapine (0.1, 0.5, 1.5, 5.0, 10.0 mg/kg) and subjected to the glucose tolerance test (GTT). Separate groups of rats were treated with asenapine (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg), iloperidone (1.0 and 10 mg/kg) or olanzapine (1.5 and 15 mg/kg) and tested for insulin resistance with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HIEC).\nAsenapine showed no metabolic effects at any dose in either test. Iloperidone caused large and significant glucose intolerance with the three highest doses in the GTT, and insulin resistance with both doses in the HIEC. Olanzapine caused significant glucose intolerance with the three highest doses in the GTT, and insulin resistance with the higher dose in the HIEC.\nIn preclinical models, asenapine shows negligible metabolic liability. By contrast, iloperidone exhibits substantial metabolic liability, comparable to olanzapine.

We investigated the internal consistency, gender differences, the test-retest and inter-rater reliability, the factorial structure, and the concurrent validity. Informants completed the HAP ratings of nursing home residents (n\u2009=\u2009385) and elderly psychiatric patients (n\u2009=\u2009204). The internal consistency of the scales is good.

This view was reflected in the name \"neuroleptic.\" Within a few years, however, the idea that the drugs were a disease-specific treatment for schizophrenia or psychosis, and that they worked by modifying the underlying pathology of the condition, replaced this earlier view, and they became known as \"antipsychotics.\" This transformation of views about the drugs' mode of action occurred with little debate or empirical evaluation in the psychiatric literature and obscured earlier evidence about the nature of these drugs. Drug advertisements in the British Journal of Psychiatry reflect the same changes, although the nondisease-specific view persisted for longer.

These drugs initiated the modern era of drug treatment for schizophrenia and other psychoses. Early research revealed that, although the pharmacological profiles of the two drugs overlapped considerably, they had different mechanisms of action. The mechanism of action of reserpine was determined first: it depletes monoamines from the brain and other tissues. By contrast, chlorpromazine has little or no effect on brain monoamine concentrations. The mystery created by two drugs that have similar pharmacological profiles but different mechanisms of action is the chlorpromazine enigma. For about eight years after the mechanism of action of reserpine was determined, researchers followed several false leads about the mechanism of action of chlorpromazine. Then, in 1963, Arvid Carlsson and Margit Lindqvist proposed that chlorpromazine (and haloperidol) work by blocking \"monoaminergic\" receptors. It was quickly determined that dopamine receptor blockade was the most important action.

Nascent emotional systems thus affect cognitive development. A second proposal concerns two additions to the affective systems identified by Panksepp. We suggest there is substantial evidence for a primary emotional organizing program dealing with power, rank, dominance, and subordination which instantiates competitive and territorial behavior and is an evolutionary contributor to self-esteem in humans.

Here, we report a study in a genetic mouse model for major mental illness guided by results from human brain imaging: a systematic study using small animal positron emission tomography (PET), autoradiography, microdialysis and molecular biology in a putative dominant-negative mutant DISC1 transgenic model. This mouse model showed augmented binding of radioligands to the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) in the striatum as well as neurochemical and behavioral changes to methamphetamine administration. Previously we reported that this model displayed deficits in the forced swim test, a representative indicator of antidepressant efficacy. By combining the results of our two studies, we propose a working hypothesis for future studies that this model might represent a mixed condition of depression and psychosis. We hope that this study will also help bridge a major gap in translational psychiatry between basic characterization of animal models and clinico-pharmacological assessment of patients mainly through PET imaging."}, {"Title": "Reliability and validity of the Arabic Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) in a clinical sample.", "Abstract": "This study aimed at investigating the reliability and validity of the Arabic Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) as a first child and adolescent anxiety screening tool in the Arab World. The English parent (SCARED-P) and child (SCARED-C) versions were translated into Arabic and administered along with the Arabic Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to 77 parents and 67 children attending a Psychiatry clinic. DSM-IV-TR diagnoses were made by a psychiatrist without knowledge of the scale scores. Internal consistency was confirmed by Cronbach's \u03b1=0.92 for SCARED-P and 0.91 for SCARED-C. Their subscales had internal consistencies between 0.65 and 0.89. Parent-child agreement was r=0.67, p<0.001. SCARED-P demonstrated good discriminant validity between participants with anxiety disorders and those with other psychiatric disorders (t(72)=3.13, p=0.003). For SCARED-C, this difference was significant when participants with depressive disorders were excluded (t(43)=2.58, p=0.01). Convergent validity was evident through a significant correlation between SCARED-P and the parent SDQ emotional subscale (r=0.70, p<0.001), and SCARED-C and the child SDQ emotional subscale (r=0.70, p<0.001). Divergent validity with the SDQ hyperactivity subscale was observed as no significant correlation was found.

Patients who met the diagnostic criteria for PFH were referred to psychiatry clinic where the subjects were evaluated through Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders-I and Temperament and Character Inventory.\nIn order to examine the difference between the PFH and control group in terms of temperament and character properties, one-way Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was conducted. In terms of temperament properties, PFH group took significantly higher scores than control group in Fatigability and asthenia dimension. In terms of character properties, PFH group scored significantly lower than control group in Purposefulness, Resourcefulness, Self-Directedness and scored significantly higher than control group in Self-forgetfulness and Self-Transcendence.\nTemperament and character features of PFH patients were different from healthy group and it was considered that these features were affected by many factors including genetic, biological, environmental, socio-cultural elements. During the follow-up of PFH cases, psychiatric evaluation is important and interventions, especially psychotherapeutic interventions can increase the chances of success of the dermatological treatments and can have a positive impact on the quality of life and social cohesion of chronic cases."}, {"Title": "Sexually dimorphic white matter geometry abnormalities in adolescent onset schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The normal human brain is characterized by a pattern of gross anatomical asymmetry. This pattern, known as the \"torque\", is associated with a sexual dimorphism: The male brain tends to be more asymmetric than that of the female. This fact, along with well-known sex differences in brain development (faster in females) and onset of psychosis (earlier with worse outcome in males), has led to the theory that schizophrenia is a disorder in which sex-dependent abnormalities in the development of brain torque, the correlate of the capacity for language, cause alterations in interhemispheric connectivity, which are causally related to psychosis (Crow TJ, Paez P, Chance SE. 2007. Callosal misconnectivity and the sex difference in psychosis. Int Rev Psychiatry. 19(4):449-457.). To provide evidence toward this theory, we analyze the geometry of interhemispheric white matter connections in adolescent-onset schizophrenia, with a particular focus on sex, using a recently introduced framework for white matter geometry computation in diffusion tensor imaging data (Savadjiev P, Kindlmann GL, Bouix S, Shenton ME, Westin CF. 2010. Local white geometry from diffusion tensor gradients. Neuroimage. 49(4):3175-3186.). Our results reveal a pattern of sex-dependent white matter geometry abnormalities that conform to the predictions of Crow's torque theory and correlate with the severity of patients' symptoms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to associate geometrical differences in white matter connectivity with torque in schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Delusional parasitosis with hyperthyroidism in an elderly woman: a case report.", "Abstract": "Delusional parasitosis is a rare, monosymptomatic psychosis involving a delusion of being infested with parasites. It is commonly observed among female patients over the age of 50. It is classified as a 'delusional disorder' according to the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases and as a 'delusional disorder - somatic type' according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition. Delusional parasitosis was reported to be associated with physical disorders such as hypoparathyroidism, Huntington's chorea and Alzheimer's disease, among others. Other than vitamin deficiencies however, a causal relationship has not to date been identified. We present this case due to the rarity of Turkish patients with this condition, its duration of follow-up, and its temporal pattern of symptoms paralleling thyroid function tests.\nOur patient was a 70-year-old white Anatolian Turkish woman with primary school education who had been living alone for the past five years. She presented to our psychiatry department complaining of 'feeling large worms moving in her body'. The complaints started after she was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, increased when she did not use her thyroid medications and remitted when she was compliant with treatment. She was treated with pimozide 2mg/day for 20 months and followed-up without any antipsychotic treatment for an additional nine months. At her last examination, she was euthyroid, not receiving antipsychotics and was not having any delusions.\nAlthough endocrine disorders, including hyperthyroidism, are listed among the etiological factors contributing to secondary delusional parasitosis, as far as we are aware this is the first case demonstrating a temporal pattern of thyroid hyperfunction and delusions through a protracted period of follow-up. It may be that the treatment of delusional parasitosis depends on clarifying the etiology and that atypical antipsychotics may help in the management of primary delusional parasitosis. Further studies on the relationship between thyroid hormones and dopaminergic neurotransmission may be warranted."}, {"Title": "Development of mental health quality indicators (MHQIs) for inpatient psychiatry based on the interRAI mental health assessment.", "Abstract": "Outcome quality indicators are rarely used to evaluate mental health services because most jurisdictions lack clinical data systems to construct indicators in a meaningful way across mental health providers. As a result, important information about the effectiveness of health services remains unknown. This study examined the feasibility of developing mental health quality indicators (MHQIs) using the Resident Assessment Instrument - Mental Health (RAI-MH), a clinical assessment system mandated for use in Ontario, Canada as well as many other jurisdictions internationally.\nRetrospective analyses were performed on two datasets containing RAI-MH assessments for 1,056 patients from 7 facilities and 34,788 patients from 70 facilities in Ontario, Canada. The RAI-MH was completed by clinical staff of each facility at admission and follow-up, typically at discharge. The RAI-MH includes a breadth of information on symptoms, functioning, socio-demographics, and service utilization. Potential MHQIs were derived by examining the empirical patterns of improvement and incidence in depressive symptoms and cognitive performance across facilities in both sets of data. A prevalence indicator was also constructed to compare restraint use. Logistic regression was used to evaluate risk adjustment of MHQIs using patient case-mix index scores derived from the RAI-MH System for Classification of Inpatient Psychiatry.\nSubscales from the RAI-MH, the Depression Severity Index (DSI) and Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS), were found to have good reliability and strong convergent validity. Unadjusted rates of five MHQIs based on the DSI, CPS, and restraints showed substantial variation among facilities in both sets of data. For instance, there was a 29.3% difference between the first and third quartile facility rates of improvement in cognitive performance. The case-mix index score was significantly related to MHQIs for cognitive performance and restraints but had a relatively small impact on adjusted rates/prevalence.\nThe RAI-MH is a feasible assessment system for deriving MHQIs. Given the breadth of clinical content on the RAI-MH there is an opportunity to expand the number of MHQIs beyond indicators of depression, cognitive performance, and restraints. Further research is needed to improve risk adjustment of the MHQIs for their use in mental health services report card and benchmarking activities."}, {"Title": "Self-inflicted lesions in dermatology: terminology and classification--a position paper from the European Society for Dermatology and Psychiatry (ESDaP).", "Abstract": "The terminology, classification, diagnosis and treatment of self-inflicted dermatological lesions are subjects of open debate.

These centers were asked to complete a questionnaire, and 107 (61%) of them answered 5 questions dealing specifically with ECT teaching. These questions were as follows: (1) Does your facility have an ECT teaching program for residents in psychiatry? (2) How is ECT taught to residents in psychiatry? (3) If direct supervision of the administration of ECT is a requirement of the psychiatry training program, is there a minimum number of supervised treatments or minimum duration of training period? (4) Do residents provide unsupervised ECT at your center? (5) Which other groups of learners, if any, are provided with orientation, teaching, or training in ECT?\nSixty percent of respondents had no ECT teaching program for psychiatry residents. Pedagogical methods varied, ranging from direct observation of ECT treatments to directed readings. Few centers required a minimum number of supervised treatments. No resident-administered ECT is performed without direct supervision. Interestingly, various groups of health care professionals were often invited to participate in ECT training.\nThe situation regarding ECT teaching continues to be a cause for concern given the noted absence of organized, structured, and mandatory programs. No resident administering ECT, however, goes unsupervised, which is in keeping with good practice. Electroconvulsive therapy is taught in many different ways, and teaching is accessible to different groups of health care professionals. However, much remains to be done to standardize ECT teaching to render this therapy available to all those who need it and to overcome the stigma and bias associated with it."}, {"Title": "Interrater reliability of 2 definitions of seizure adequacy in electroconvulsive therapy.", "Abstract": "Clear evidence of a generalized seizure is regarded as an essential component of a therapeutic electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) session.

We examined the reliability of using EEG criteria compared to simple measures of seizure duration by reviewing 100 sample EEG printouts obtained during ECT sessions in a Scottish hospital ECT unit.\nThe EEGs were independently assessed by 3 clinicians (a \"control\" ECT consultant, an experienced ECT therapist, and a less experienced trainee) blind to each other's ratings.\nWhile there was good interrater reliability for measures of seizure duration, kappa scores for EEG criteria were much better for the more than the less experienced rater (\u03ba = 0.68 vs 0.50). Even greater differences were seen for individual components: polyspike activity (\u03ba = 0.80 vs 0.55), spike and wave complexes (\u03ba = 0.80 vs 0.38), and postictal suppression (\u03ba = 0.63 vs 0.35).\nThe implications of these finding are briefly discussed in the context of developing rational criteria for assessing ECT efficacy that rely upon the consistent and replicable delivery of standardized ECT techniques and consequent training needs of ECT practitioners."}, {"Title": "Caregiver strain and symptoms of depression among principal caregivers of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder in Sri Lanka.", "Abstract": "Data on caregiver strain and depression of principal caregivers of patients with mental illnesses are few in developing countries.

QoL levels were the most important features predicting relapse. We found that a higher level of QoL predicts a lower rate of relapse at 24 months: HR\u2009=\u20090.82 (0.74; 0.91), p\u2009<\u20090.001 for the SF36-Physical Composite Score; and HR\u2009=\u20090.88 (0.81; 0.96), p\u2009=\u20090.002 for the SF36-Mental Composite Score. These results were not confirmed using the QoLI: HR\u2009=\u20090.91 (0.81; 1.01), p\u2009=\u20090.083. To a lesser extent, older age, better functioning, and a higher compliance score also predict a lower rate of relapse at 24 months (HRs from 0.97 to 0.98; p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nQoL, as assessed by the SF36, is an independent predictor of relapse at a 24-month follow-up in schizophrenia.

Previous studies examining the prevalence and clinical characteristics of delayed-onset PTSD have yielded inconclusive findings. This study prospectively examines the prevalence and clinical picture of late-onset PTSD among Israeli war veterans.

They were divided into 4 groups, according to the duration of delay in PTSD onset. Participants completed self-report questionnaires tapping psychopathology, combat exposure and socio-demographics. 16.5% of the veterans suffered from late-onset PTSD. A longer delay in PTSD onset was associated with less severe psychopathology. Also, CSR was associated with a shorter delay in PTSD onset. Finally, the vast majority of veterans already suffered from PTSD symptoms prior to late PTSD onset. Our results offer further validation for the existence of delayed-onset PTSD.

One of its side effects is the loud click sound generated simultaneously to the magnetic pulse, which depends both on the equipment and rTMS intensity. This impulse sound could transiently modify peripheral hearing mechanisms, and hence hearing thresholds, both in patients and in rTMS practitioners. Furthermore, if no precautions are taken, especially in subjects with several risks factors for hearing loss, it is possible that the repetition of exposure could lead to more definitive changes in hearing thresholds. These issues are often neglected, although they could have specific relevance in rTMS treatment for tinnitus or in auditory cognitive neuroscience.

Information on use of benzodiazepines according to the referral was recorded, and serum samples were analysed for benzodiazepine drugs. The number of patients with incorrect information in the referral was calculated for each benzodiazepine.\nInformation on benzodiazepine use was included in 60\u00a0% of patient referrals. However, serum analyses revealed the use of different or additional benzodiazepines compared with the referral information in 24\u00a0% of the patients.

Primary outcomes were composite scores on a 21-item attitudes toward psychiatry (ATP) survey and the number of correct responses to diagnostic questions following a series of three clinical case vignettes.\nMean composite score on the ATP items was 78/105 (SD = 9.6), representing overall positive attitudes among the students. Female gender and having learned about more psychiatric disorders were positively associated with a higher mean ATP score and remained so after adjustment for relevant covariates.\nChinese medical students reported positive attitudes towards psychiatry, openness with regard to psychiatric services, and respect for psychiatric patients.

Parametric, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and logistic regression analyses were performed, to compare psychiatric and function variables between the two study groups while controlling for age and sex.\n\u2002 Of the 92 patients with PNES who fulfilled inclusion/exclusion criteria, 41 (44.6%) had a history of TBI. Of the 41 patients with TBI, 30 (73%) met criteria for mild TBI (mTBI). Patients with TBI had more mood disorder diagnoses, were more likely to receive disability, and had lower global functioning than non-TBI patients with PNES, after adjusting for age and sex. Patients with TBI and PNES had significantly increased odds for having major depression, behavioral impulsivity, posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis, and a trauma/abuse history.\nTBI is a significant risk factor in patients with PNES, being associated with increased psychiatric diagnostic comorbidity, symptoms severity, poorer functioning, and increased disability. This study reveals the importance of identifying and addressing the impact of TBI in patients with seizure disorders.

On the other hand, child psychiatric fellows find several areas of CBT challenging because it is often vastly different from previous experience, including more frequent and longer sessions, the use of collaborative empiricism, developing case conceptualizations, and tolerating negative affective arousal. Moreover, training climates in psychiatry departments may shape the supervision experiences. Various specific recommendations are offered to manage these crucibles.

It has many traditional and medicinal usages in treating Parkinson's disease (1), abdominal pain, cholera, infertility, scorpion bites, diabetes (3) and is found in tropical Africa, India, the Caribbean and China. During the fall of 2011, the velvet bean plants in Longan County, Guangxi, China, were damaged by a leaf disease previously unreported in China. Field inspections revealed disease incidences as high as 80%. Symptoms consisted of large spots developing between the leaf veins that ranged in length from 1 to 3 cm. Spots were dark brown, generally rectangular, and were visible from both sides of the leaf. Lots of black mycelia and conidia were found on the backs of the lesions. Lesions typically expanded and affected the entire leaf, resulting in leaves withered and killed. An Alternaria sp. having conidia with prominent beaks and spores produced singly was consistently observed on and isolated from symptomatic leaf tissue. The conidia body was brown, ovoid, obclavate, muriform, and septate, with transverse and longitudinal septa that varied from 6 to 9 and 0 to 2, respectively, and its dimensions varied from 60 to 120 \u00d7 15 to 20 \u03bcm. The beaks were 10 to 70 \u00d7 3 to 6 \u03bcm and were filamentous, slender, and unbranched. Pure culture of the fungus was made from a single spore. DNA was extracted and used in an internal transcribed spacer (ITS) PCR used ITS1 and ITS4 primers. The PCR products were purified and sequenced. The sequences were used in BLAST searches to interrogate the GenBank for sequence similarity. High sequence similarity of 100% was obtained with Alternaria porri isolate AP-18. Based on the morphological and molecular characterization, the isolate was identified as A. porri (Ellis) Ciferri (GenBank Accession No. JX556683) (2). The pathogenicity of five isolates was investigated to demonstrate Koch's postulates. Forty 8-week-old seedlings of M. pruriens, without wounding on their leaves, were sprayed with the spore suspension (10<sup>5</sup> spores per ml), prepared by using 10-day-old cultures of the isolates grown on potato dextrose agar at 28\u00b0C in the dark. Every plant was sprayed with 4 ml of spore suspension. The inoculated plants were incubated in a humid chamber for 48 h and then maintained in a greenhouse. After 5 to 7 days, leaf spots similar to those observed in the field developed on all inoculated plants. The pathogen was reisolated and identified as A. porri. Control plants sprayed with distilled water remained symptomless. The inoculation test was repeated and results were the same. Because A. porri was reported to infect plants of Allium spp and cause purple blotch, we also inoculated this isolate to small onion plants, and the symptoms of purple blotch appeared after 13 days at 25 to 28\u00b0C in a greenhouse. To our knowledge, this is the first report of leaf spot caused by A. porri on velvet bean in China. References: (1) R. Katzenschlager et al. J. Neurol. Neurosurg Psychiatry. 75:1672, 2004. (2) S. T.

(Her father was later convicted of manslaughter and imprisoned.) The older child was also covered with bite marks. When she was twenty-nine months old, this child, whom I call \"Cammie,\" was brought to me from miles away by herfoster parents for once-monthly psychotherapy. I have treated her, stressing abreaction, context, and correction, once a month ever since. When she was five years old Cammie's foster family adopted her. She is now twenty-two. I call her the \"wild child\" because of the growly voice, vomiting at will, grabbing at the genitalia of strangers, and cruelties to animals that she exhibited after her rescue. Presently she attends college and is training to be a preschool teacher or an aide to pediatricians. I have taken notes on what Cammie says and does during the twenty years she has come to me. In the spring of 2011, I was asked to speak later that year about infantile memories at the Margaret Mahler Symposium, Columbia University, New York. With the organizing committee's approval, I accompanied Cammie and her adoptive mother to the October 1, 2011, meeting and asked her in front of the psychoanalytic audience to recount her oldest remembrances. She, her mother, and I spoke about the nonverbal manifestations of her memory as well. I had briefly prepared Cammie and her mother for our presentation at the Mahler Symposium, but for the most part, it was spontaneous and unrehearsed. Their comments are quoted in this article. At twenty-two the \"wild child\" reports no verbal memory from her first year. On the other hand, her behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions over the years have reflected what occurred to her and indicate very active nonverbal memories of the traumatic experiences. Fragments of verbal memory that she recounted in therapy between ages two and three have entirely slipped away. Several kinds of behavioral reenactments of the abuses she received as an infant have been reversed into altruism. Other attitudes and behaviors have remained unaltered, however. Under the influence of street drugs or anesthetics, her infantile memories have been reawakened in the form of illusions, delusions, and condensation. Following a disaster in Japan, a shard of infantile memory was retrieved in the form of a repeated nightmare. Single cases like Cammie's inform us about the course of traumatic memories through childhood. Such cases may lead us to follow larger groups of infants for extended periods of time. We must try to further understand the effects of early trauma on the brains and minds of young children.

Early studies indicated an overall association between manic-depressive illness and higher social class. However, recent epidemiologic studies have failed to find an association between BD and SES. Instead, they report a similar distribution of BD among social classes and educational levels, and in one particular study, a lower family income was reported. The determinants of SES are complex, and the early findings are now interpreted as having been incorrect and stemming from past methodological weaknesses.\nFor this analysis we explored the relationship between SES and BD in a sample of patients who had participated in prior clinical and therapeutic studies. These patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for BD, required long-term stabilizing treatment, and were assessed in terms of their response to lithium stabilization and a number of other clinical characteristics in accordance with research protocol. Good response to lithium stabilization (LiR) served as a proxy for identifying a subtype of manic-depressive illness, the classical form of BD. Non-responders to stabilizing lithium (LiNR) were considered belonging to other subtypes of bipolar spectrum disorder. The SES of the parents was measured upon entry into treatment using the Hollingshead SES scale, which despite its limitations has been used in psychiatry most widely to determine SES. The groups of LiR and LiNR were compared statistically in terms of SES. The influence of bipolar subtype and gender on SES was investigated.\nA significantly higher SES was associated with the lithium-responsive form (LiR) of BD when compared with patients continuing to relapse despite adequate lithium treatment (representing other types of bipolar spectrum). Our observation suggests that the discrepant literature findings about SES and BD may be better explained by the change in diagnostic practices: early studies describing a positive relationship included mostly classical manic-depressive disorder, while the patients in recent studies have been diagnosed according to much broader criteria, reflecting the era of bipolar spectrum disorder."}, {"Title": "Biological rhythm disturbance in remitted bipolar patients.", "Abstract": "Biological rhythm disturbance is common in bipolar patients and seems to affect the course and prognosis of the illness negatively.

Whilst evidence-based pharmacological and psychological treatments are available for OCD, a significant proportion of OCD patients fail to respond and for many of the OCD-related disorders no validated treatments are as yet recognised. In addition, predictors of treatment response/non-response to guide clinicians in the management of individual patients are lacking. The introduction of personalised medicine to psychiatry is expected to offer the novel prospect of identifying the most effective treatment for a patient in a timely and cost-effective way. Translational research that investigates endophenotype predictors of treatment response in OCD and related disorders may pave the way toward personalised medicine. Such research is likely to require multidisciplinary collaboration between neuroscientists and clinicians, so that the right clinical questions are addressed, and large datasets, entailing multinational, multicentre sampling. In order to facilitate the translational investigation of the key aspects of the treatment response, these studies would require access to standardised treatment paradigms that are internationally recognised. In this chapter, we introduce some of the most important outstanding questions for personalised medicine that translational research could be expected to address within the next 10 years. We review the available tools and techniques for standardised clinical assessment and the criteria that are used to define the degree of therapeutic response (response, remission, relapse, resistance) that would naturally dictate the direction of treatment. We also present a series of consecutive stepped treatment algorithms based on evidence-based practice and modelled on naturalistic care that we believe could be adapted to multicentre settings as a template for the translational researcher to aid in the design of pragmatic treatment trials that are capable of identifying biomarkers of treatment response or non-response at each key stage of the evidence-based canon."}, {"Title": "The early phases of anxiety disorders: from prevention to treatment.", "Abstract": "The 'early intervention' model has been applied with good results to the care of a range of serious medical conditions.

Although in the field of psychiatry this model has mainly been implemented in nonaffective psychosis, research evidence supports its application in other mental disorders. To promote this initiative, the chapter explores the available evidence demonstrating the feasibility of adopting the key elements of the model in the care of the whole spectrum of anxiety disorders. In addition, the chapter describes the different stages that are possible to identify in the process of developing an illness, and also the phase-specific interventions that could be applied. Finally, the service repercussions of implementing an early intervention model in anxiety disorders are discussed."}, {"Title": "A view of personality disorder from the colonial periphery.", "Abstract": "To examine the history of personality disorder in the context of contemporary post-colonial Jamaican society.\nThe literature outlining the development and classification of personality disorder is reviewed. The social, psychiatric and epidemiological studies of personality disorder in Jamaica are presented.\nA categorical classification system of personality disorder has been in use by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) from the mid 20th century. Challenging that approach is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), which represents the dimensional method, which views pathology as a continuum from normal personality traits. Both systems suffer from an absence of cultural flexibility, an absence of a a system of severity, and a lack of treatment specificity, which foster misdiagnosis while making treatment planning difficult and unreliable. The proposed DSM-5 attempts to integrate a prototypematching system and identification of personality traits promises disappointing outcomes. The University of the West Indies, Section of Psychiatry, proposes a phenomenological nosological approach, advocating an alternate DSM Axis I category called Shakatani derived from Swahili shaka (problem), tani (power), and developing a 38-item Jamaica Personality Disorder Inventory (JPDI) screening questionnaire for diagnosing this condition.

Mental disorders are now the fifth priority disease after cancer, stroke, acute myocardial infarction and diabetes for national medical services since April 2013. Each prefecture has to implement strategic mental healthcare plans at the regional level. With the increase in co-morbid mental and physical illnesses, patient information should be shared between psychiatric and non-psychiatric healthcare providers, and coordination is required in the healthcare systems. A better understanding of mental health between patients and medical staffs could contribute to improved access to psychiatric services in the integrated mental health care system. Collaborative care programs focusing on depression screening and management in the Mental Health Care Project for Patients with Physical Illness have been launched among six national specialized care and research centers (cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, child care, geriatric care and neurology and psychiatry) since 2012.

In medicine and health, biomarkers can be paraphrased as diagnostic methods objectively conducive to treatment. Here, we discuss biomarkers of schizophrenia as a representative mental illness, whose research has advanced compared with that of other disorders. Schizophrenia is a syndrome with a typical course and symptoms. Its pathophysiology and pathogenesis have not been elucidated (medically however, its underlying biological mechanisms are assumed to be present. That is, in biomarker discovery, when the pathogenesis and cause are elucidated, the patient group would not consiste of schizophrenia but, it is a new disease of \"x x disease.\" For example, neurosyphilis is exogenous psychosis, by finding a biomarker of syphilis spirochete, a new disease concept of neurosyphilis could be distinguished from the schizophrenia). In this way, it can be said that biomarker research is essential for the development of new diagnostic and treatment methods for mental illness. There are several biomarker research methods such as genetic analysis, biological sample analysis, cognitive analysis, neurophysiology, neuroimaging, animal models, and post-mortem brain analysis. Further, studies have been made, however, biomarkers that can explain all of schizophrenia has not been found yet. As schizophrenia is assumed to be a heterogenous syndrome, it is believed that the etiology varies. Thus, there is a possibility that targeting schizophrenia as a whole will make it difficulty to find biomarkers for patients with schizophrenia. It is considered that appropriate subgroup analysis is needed. In order to overcome it, amount-of-resources strategy to find patients by using large of samples has been made mainly in Europe and the United States. In Japan, we have used sub-group analysis strategy to elaborate this issue such as the use of an intermediate phenotype. It is not possible to research a similar strategy, because of the limited funds and manpower in Japan compared to U. S. and Europe. As nationwide research organizations in Japan, such as IGC (Imaging genetics consortium), combination analysis of genetics and neuroimaging and COCORO (Cognitive genetics collaborative research organization), combination analysis of genetics and cognitive function, have been established, the development of biomarkers for mental illnesses is expected in the near future."}, {"Title": "[Impact of advances in neuroimaging on clinical psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The theme of this symposium is the impact of brain imaging on clinical psychiatry.

With recent advances in noninvasive in vivo human brain imaging (fMRI/PET), it has become possible to investigate deep structures and molecular mechanisms in the brain. Thus, brain imaging plays an important role in understanding the mechanisms of current treatments, optimizing these treatments, and advancing them. On the other hand, with the dissemination of noninvasive human neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI, interdisciplinary neuroimaging studies on emotions and decision-making have been accelerated.

Participants included consultant and resident neurologists, a medical librarian, epileptology, and psychiatry content experts.\nA pilot randomized control clinical trial was selected for critical appraisal. Thirty-eight PNES patients were randomized to flexible-dose sertraline (target dose, 200 mg/d) or placebo. Only 68% of patients contributed data to the primary analysis and baseline PNES frequency was notably dissimilar. Twelve-week seizure frequency rates, as compared with baseline, were 45% lower in the sertraline group (P=0.03) but unchanged in the placebo group (8% increase; P=0.78). After adjustment for baseline differences, between-treatment group comparison revealed a trend toward lower event frequency in the sertraline group (risk ratio 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-1.05; P=0.29).

We argue that neglect of these issues is a crucial source of the stagnation of psychiatric research. In honor of the centenary of Karl Jaspers' book, General Psychopathology, we offer a critique of the contemporary \"operationalist\" epistemology, a critique that is consistent with Jaspers' views. Symptoms and signs cannot be properly understood or identified apart from an appreciation of the nature of consciousness or subjectivity, which in turn cannot be treated as a collection of thing-like, mutually independent objects, accessible to context-free, \"atheoretical\" definitions or unproblematic forms of measurement (as is often assumed in structured interviewing). Adequate and faithful distinctions in the phenomenal or experiential realm are therefore a fundamental prerequisite for classification, treatment, and research.

Rudolph Gottfried Arndt and his 1870s studies.", "Abstract": "Today's brain stimulation methods are commonly traced back historically to surgical brain operations. With this one-sided historical approach it is easy to overlook the fact that non-surgical electrical brain-stimulating applications preceded present-day therapies.\nThe first study on transcranial electrical brain stimulation for the treatment of severe mental diseases in a larger group of patients was carried out in the 1870s.\nBetween 1870 and 1878 German psychiatrist Rudolph Gottfried Arndt published the results of his studies in three reports. These are contextualized with contemporary developments of the time, focusing in particular on the (neuro-) sciences. As was common practice at the time, Arndt basically reported individual cases in which electricity was applied to treat severe psychoses with depressive symptoms or even catatonia, hypochondriac delusion and melancholia. Despite their lengthiness, there is frequently a lack of precise physical data on the application of psychological-psychopathological details. Only his 1878 report includes general rules for electrical brain stimulation.\nDespite their methodological shortcomings and lack of precise treatment data impeding exact understanding, Arndt's studies are pioneering works in the field of electric brain stimulation with psychoses and its positive impacts. Today's transcranial direct current stimulation, and partly vagus nerve stimulation, can be compared with Arndt's methods. Although Arndt's only tangible results were indications for the application of faradic electricity (for inactivity, stupor, weakness and manic depressions) and galvanic current (for affective disorders and psychoses), a historiography of present-day brain stimulation therapies should no longer neglect studies on electrotherapy published in German and international psychiatric and neurological journals and monographs in the 1870s and 1880s."}, {"Title": "Separate may not be equal: a preliminary investigation of clinical correlates of electronic psychiatric record accessibility in academic medical centers.", "Abstract": "Electronic Medical Records (EMR) have the potential to improve the coordination of healthcare in this country, yet the field of psychiatry has lagged behind other medical disciplines in its adoption of EMR.\nPsychiatrists at 18 of the top US hospitals completed an electronic survey detailing whether their psychiatric records were stored electronically and accessible to non-psychiatric physicians.

This capacity for self-regulation is evolutionarily realized by the highly developed neocortex and developmentally matures during adolescence. Inappropriate maturation of the neural systems responsible for self-regulation in adolescence could lead to the emergence of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric disorder, the onset of which usually takes place during adolescence/youth; one of its core features is disturbance of self-related information processing. Although schizophrenia has been associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities during the perinatal period, recently improved neuroimaging techniques have shown progressive deterioration in the structure and function of neocortical regions in the prodromal and first-episode stages of the disorder. These reconsiderations have stimulated neurobiological investigations into the normal developmental process and its disturbance of the glutamatergic/synaptic system in adolescence. Of late, clinical psychiatry has been seeking early intervention strategies by integrating biological and psychosocial approaches. By integrating epidemiology, social neuroscience, and psychiatry, we aim to establish a new interdisciplinary science to uncover the developmental mechanisms of self-regulation in adolescence and create supportive and preventive strategies, which will ultimately contribute to education and society."}, {"Title": "[Adjustment disorders with anxiety. Clinical and psychometric characteristics in patients consulting a general practitioner].", "Abstract": "The DSM-IV and ICD-10 descriptions of adjustment disorders are broadly similar. Their main features are the following: the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); the symptoms resolve within 6 months, once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Adjustment disorder with anxiety (ADA) is a very common diagnosis in primary care, liaison and general psychiatry services but we still lack data about its specificity as a clinical entity. Current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress.\nNinety-seven patients with ADA according DSM-IV were recruited in this primary care study and compared with 30 control subjects matched for age and sex. The diagnosis was made according to the MINI questionnaire completed with a standardized research of stressful events and an assessment of anxiety symptoms using different scales: the Hamilton Anxiety rating Scale (HAM-A), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD), The Penn-State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), the Positive and Negative Emotionality scale, 31 items (EPN-31 scale) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S).\nLife events in relation to work were the most frequent (43%). In terms of symptomatology, results showed that ADA is associated with a level of anxiety close to those obtained in other anxiety disorders, particularly GAD, in relation to general symptoms (physical and somatic) as well as anxious rumination and negative emotions.\nFurther research is needed to better understand the disorder and clarify its frontiers, which still remain a controversial issue with regard to the homeostatic response to stress and other types of anxiety disorders. The results of our study suggest that this sub syndromic entity should be recognized and adequately treated, especially in general practice where it is very common."}, {"Title": "[Structural connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging in autism spectrum disorders].", "Abstract": "Over the past years, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become an important brain-imaging technique in neuropsychiatric research.

Patient factors, such as continuous medical care needs, mobility, and comprehension, will affect the efficiency of the evacuation and translate into evacuation resource needs. Prior evacuation resource estimates are 30 years old.\nUtilizing a cross-sectional survey of charge nurses of the clinical units in an urban, academic, adult trauma health care facility (HCF), the evacuation needs of hospitalized patients were assessed periodically over a two-year period.\nSurvey data were collected on 2,050 patients. Units with patients having low continuous medical care needs during an emergency evacuation were the postpartum, psychiatry, rehabilitation medicine, surgical, and preoperative anesthesia care units, the Emergency Department, and Labor and Delivery Department (with the exception of patients in Stage II labor). Units with patients having high continuous medical care needs during an evacuation included the neonatal and adult intensive care units, special procedures unit, and operating and post-anesthesia care units. With the exception of the neonate group, 908 (47%) of the patients would be able to walk out of the facility, 492 (25.5%) would require a wheelchair, and 530 (27.5%) would require a stretcher to exit the HCF. A total of 1,639 patients (84.9%) were deemed able to comprehend the need to evacuate and to follow directions; the remainder were sedated, blind, or deaf. The charge nurses also determined that 17 (6.9%) of the 248 adult intensive care unit patients were too ill to survive an evacuation, and that in 10 (16.4%) of the 61 ongoing surgery cases, stopping the case was not considered to be safe.\nHeath care facilities can utilize the results of this study to model their anticipated resource requirements for an emergency evacuation.

Both syndromes indicate an increased risk for subsequent somatic morbidity, worsening depression functional deterioration, admission to a nursing home and mortality.

From a historical point of view the syndromal approach results from a reaction to the nosological model of Emil Kraepelin. Later the syndromal diagnostic approach became more important because it enabled a quantitative-dimensional assessment and analysis of psychopathological data using modern statistical procedures. However, attempts to ascribe the traditional nosological categories to psychopathological syndromes using multivariate statistical methods have failed. The syndromal approach allows a differentiated recording of the cross-sectional symptomatology; however, a plurality of different syndromes might be registered without considering meaningful principles of classification and longitudinal aspects. The syndromal approach should be complemented by a nosological classification based mainly on the psychopathological course due to the absence of consistent neurobiological findings."}, {"Title": "The Partnership Access Line: evaluating a child psychiatry consult program in Washington State.", "Abstract": "To evaluate a telephone-based child mental health consult service for primary care providers (PCPs).\nRecord review, provider surveys, and Medicaid database analysis.\nWashington State Partnership Access Line (PAL) program.\nA total of 2285 PAL consultations by 592 PCPs between April 1, 2008, and April 30, 2011.\nPrimary care provider-initiated consultations with PAL service.\nThe PAL call characteristics, PCP feedback surveys, and Medicaid claims between April 2007 and December 2009 for fee-for-service Medicaid children before and after a PAL call.\nSixty-nine percent of calls were about children with serious emotional disturbances, and 66% of calls were about children taking psychiatric medications.

While LSTs have benefits over traditional randomized clinical trials and observational studies, there are inherent challenges to their conduct. Enrollment and follow-up of a large study sample of patients with mental illness pose a particular difficulty. To assist in overcoming operational barriers in future LSTs in psychiatry, this paper describes the recruitment and observational follow-up strategies used for the ZODIAC study, an international, open-label LST, which followed 18,239 persons randomly assigned to one of two treatments indicated for schizophrenia for 1 year. ZODIAC enrolled patients in 18 countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia using broad study entry criteria and required minimal clinical care intervention. Recruitment of adequate numbers and continued engagement of both study centers and subjects were significant challenges. Strategies implemented to mitigate these in ZODIAC include global study expansion, study branding, field coordinator and site relations programs, monthly site newsletters, collection of alternate contact information, conduct of national death index (NDI) searches, and frequent sponsor, contract research organization (CRO) and site interaction to share best practices and address recruitment challenges quickly.

A recent study conducted by Inserm Unit 750 found a frequency of 2.1 cases of neonaticide for 100,000 births in France. The persistence of these crimes raises serious issues, and scientists have attempted to explain this by the profile of neonaticidal mothers: young, or even teenage, single, primiparous, and socially deprived. The present study sought to question this profile, and to suggest a new profile for neonaticidal mothers.\nThis retrospective study over the years 1996-2000 comprised 32 cases of neonaticide perpetrated in three French regions. Seventeen solved cases of these 32 cases generated 54 documents by expert consultants, mainly psychiatric and psychological expertise, studied and analysed here using Modalisa software for quantitative analyses and Nvivo software for qualitative data.\nNo single socio-demographic profile was observed. The mothers were in contrasting situations at the time of the event. There were few psychotic profiles. The other psychopathological disturbances detected were very often related to the event. The most surprising feature in the expert reports describing the neonaticidal mothers was the existence of what we have termed \"descriptive absent-factors\". These mothers had not experienced major trauma in childhood such as the death of persons close or foster care. They were not living in an environment of family violence. They did not exhibit addictive or self-harm behaviour. Their parents before them had similar profiles, except three cases of alcoholism. Their parentage, and that of the infants, was not an issue. The most widely described personality features were immaturity, dependency on others, withdrawal, inhibition, emptiness, lack of affectivity, non-expressiveness, and devaluation of self-image. The very impoverished relational environment of these mothers also appears in the expertise data. Their affective and relational foundations were insecure.\nThe \"classic\" profile of the neonaticidal mother as being young, single, and primiparous is not confirmed in this study. Recent American and European studies reach similar conclusions. More than half of these mothers already had other children; more than half were living with a partner. Nor did these mothers have an evident psychopathological profile, and even less so a psychopathic profile. This study suggests a \"psycho-relational\" profile for the neonaticidal mother: immature, affectively dependent, expressing herself very little, and experiencing considerable affective isolation.\nThese neonaticidal mothers did not present any specific socio-demographic or evident psychopathological profile. The study nevertheless enabled definition of a \"psycho-relational\" profile."}, {"Title": "[Charisma and leadership: new challenges for psychiatry].", "Abstract": "New challenges arise in medicine, particularly in psychiatry. In the near future, psychiatrists' role may evolve into management of mental health care teams (GPs, nurses, psychologists\u2026) thus creating the need for charisma and leadership. Charisma is defined as \u00ab\u00a0a quality that allows it's possessor to exercise influence, authority over a group\u00a0\u00bb; leadership as \u00ab\u00a0the function, the position of chief, and by extension, a dominant position\u00a0\u00bb.\nTo offer some reflections on charisma and leadership and the ways to develop them in three situations common in clinical practice: dual communication (between caregivers or with patients), oral communication (e.g., during\u00a0a symposium) and managing a mental health care team.\nMedline (1966-hits) and Web of Science (1975-hits) were explored according to the PRISMA criteria. The research paradigm was [(psychiatrist OR physician) AND mental health AND (leadership OR charisma)].\nTwo hundred and eighty articles were found, but only 34 corresponded to our subject and were included in the qualitative analysis. The leader must first ask himself/herself about his/her vision of the future, so as to share it with passion with his/her mental health team. Charisma and leadership are based on several values, among which we can mention: providing understandable, personalized care for the patient, in continuity and confidentiality; adapting care to the general population's request, maintaining one's own physical and mental health, submitting one's daily practice to peer review, engaging in continuous improvement of one's practices in response to new requirements, and recognizing that research and instruction are part of an M.D's professional obligations. The clinician will work on ways to develop his/her own charisma, through interactions with peers and team members, the care of his/her appearance (especially for first meetings) and workplace, and through positive reinforcement (some cognitive-behavioral techniques like assertiveness have been proposed to enhance the charisma, e.g., visualization and affirmation). Leadership does not depend on hierarchical position and administrative responsibilities: leaders should learn to manage and harmonize the different types of personalities within his/her team, paying special attention to passive-aggressive attitudes. We recall here some techniques to improve charisma during oral communication, such as making relationships with people by calling them by their names, making reference to things and people that the audience can identify with (like sport or cooking), using one's own style without trying to imitate someone else, focusing on one major idea, being brief and using anecdotes, using silences effectively and finally having good non-verbal communication. The conclusion should never be neglected, as an audience especially remembers the beginning and the end of a presentation. Although some features are common to all charismatic leaders (dominance, self-confidence, high energy level), a recent theory of leadership (called contingency theory) seeks to examine how different leadership styles can adapt to circumstances. This theory focuses more on the vision, passion, determination and courage of the leader and depends not only on their intrinsic qualities. No research has indeed shown individual characteristics that differentiate leaders from followers. However, doctors have not been prepared in their training to acquire leadership skills that they can use to adapt to the circumstances of their clinical practice. The most important qualities expected of a leader according to the current leadership theorists are: listening, communication, stress management, development of other's capacities, feedback, introspection and risk taking. Moreover, leadership involves positive reinforcement of the team while maintaining the feeling of individual autonomy, and being able to take an innovative decision alone with shared optimism. There is no need to have great management responsibilities in order to succeed in leadership. We reiterate the importance for a charismatic leader to smile, to be able to mock oneself and to regulate one's emotions.\nCharisma seems to be an essential dimension for effective leadership and team management. Beyond psychiatry, we believe these reflections to be useful for all branches of medicine."}, {"Title": "Use of psychotropic drugs in dermatology: unique perspectives of a dermatologist and a psychiatrist.", "Abstract": "Psychocutaneous morbidity is commonly found in dermatologic practice. Patients generally refuse referral to psychiatry, and dermatologists cannot always provide psychotherapeutic support. By establishing an alliance with these patients and with working knowledge of the common psychotherapeutic agents used in dermatology, these patients can be managed comfortably by the clinician. The major categories of psychodermatologic agents include antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and antiobsessive compulsive drugs. In addition, cutaneous dysesthesia and pruritus can be treated with psychotherapeutic agents when other treatments have been exhausted. The motivated dermatologist can apply this knowledge to treat these common yet challenging cases."}, {"Title": "[Patient therapeutic education in psychiatry. A survey of practice in Aquitaine public hospitals].", "Abstract": "The aims of this study were to assess the characteristics of therapeutic education practice in French public psychiatric hospitals and to describe the ongoing patient education programs.\nWe conducted an online survey. Adult and child psychiatrists (n=264) of Aquitaine's public hospitals (n=9) were asked to describe their daily educational practice using an internet questionnaire. Coordinators of patient education programs were invited to complete a specific questionnaire describing these programs.\nOf the 264 psychiatrists contacted, 95 participated in the only survey (participation rate 36%), 85.7% were adult psychiatrists and 14.3% child psychiatrists. Most psychiatrists (85% or more) \"always or often\" educated their patients on the disease (name, etiology, symptoms), its treatment and the prevention of relapses and complications. Other mental health professionals, such as nurses, were rarely involved in this educational process. Less than a quarter of the psychiatrists \"always or often\" invited their patients to participate in a structured patient education program. Twelve education programs were described by their coordinators (13.6% of the participants). Compared to non-coordinators, coordinators had graduated significantly more frequently less than 10years before (92% vs. 49%) but did not differ regarding other characteristics. Bipolar disorder (n=4) and schizophrenia (n=7) were the most frequent indications of these programs. Half of the programs were distributed by pharmaceutical companies. Almost half (45%) of the programs were opened to patient's carers and relatives. Increase in knowledge and competence were evaluated in 73% of the programs, and satisfaction in 64% of the programs. These findings have to be interpretated in the light of a possible selection bias favouring the participation of practitioners supporting or actively implicated in patient education, contributing to inflated estimates of the real frequency of educational practice in public psychiatric hospitals.\nOn the one hand, our study shows a strong involvement of psychiatrists in patient therapeutic education in daily practice. On the other hand, very few structured programs were ongoing, mostly concerning bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, i.e. disorders for which evidence of efficiency of patient education has been demonstrated. These findings suggest that implementation of further patient education programs should be encouraged and that formation of further professionals is a priority."}, {"Title": "Impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease: crossroads between neurology, psychiatry and neuroscience.", "Abstract": "Non-motor symptoms contribute significantly to Parkinson's disease (PD) related disability. Impulse control disorders (ICDs) have been recently added to the behavioural spectrum of PD-related non-motor symptoms. Such behaviours are characterized by an inappropriate drive to conduct repetitive behaviours that are usually socially inadequate or result in harmful consequences. Parkinson disease impulse control disorders (PD-ICDs) have raised significant interest in the scientific and medical community, not only because of their incapacitating nature, but also because they may represent a valid model of ICDs beyond PD and a means to study the physiology of drive, impulse control and compulsive actions in the normal brain. In this review, we discuss some unresolved issues regarding PD-ICDs, including the association with psychiatric co-morbidities such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and with dopamine related side effects, such as hallucinations and dyskinesias; the relationship with executive cognitive dysfunction; and the neural underpinnings of ICDs in PD. We also discuss the contribution of neuroscience studies based on animal-models towards a mechanistic explanation of the development of PD-ICDs, specifically regarding corticostriatal control of goal directed and habitual actions."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric illness of systemic lupus erythematosus in childhood: spectrum of clinically important manifestations.", "Abstract": "To determine the spectrum of manifestations in clinically important (i.e., requiring alterations of immunosuppressive therapy) psychiatric illness of pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE) and to describe the laboratory and imaging features associated with psychiatric illness of pSLE (psySLE).\nThis was a single-center cohort study of patients with pSLE followed at a pediatric SLE clinic from August 1985 to July 2009.

Previously, we performed a genomewide linkage analysis for AD in African-Americans (AAs) (Biol Psychiatry 65:111-115, 2009). The power of that linkage analysis could have been reduced by the presence of genetic heterogeneity owing to differences in admixture among AA families. We hypothesized that by examining a study sample whose genetic ancestry was more homogeneous, we could increase the power to detect linkage. To test this hypothesis, we performed ordered subset linkage analysis in 384 AA families using admixture proportion as a covariate to identify a more homogeneous subset of families and determine whether there is increased evidence for linkage with AD. Statistically significant increases in lod scores in subsets relative to the overall sample were identified on chromosomes 4 (P = 0.0001), 12 (P = 0.021), 15 (P = 0.026) and 22 (P = 0.0069). In a subset of 44 families with African ancestry proportions ranging from 0.858 to 0.996, we observed a genomewide significant linkage at 180 cM on chromosome 4 (lod = 4.24, pointwise P < 0.00001, empirical genomewide P = 0.008). A promising candidate gene located there, GLRA3, which encodes a subunit of the glycine neurotransmitter receptor. Our results demonstrate that admixture proportion can be used as a covariate to reduce genetic heterogeneity and enhance the detection of linkage for AD in an admixed population such as AAs. This approach could be applied to any linkage analysis for complex traits conducted in an admixed population."}, {"Title": "The functional anatomy of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome.", "Abstract": "Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) holds a prime position as a disorder transgressing the brittle boundaries of neurology and psychiatry with an entangling web of motor and behavioral problems.

Early identifications of these problems help to change developmental trajectories and improve developmental outcomes. Psychiatric assessment and classification have to take into account the rapid processes of development as well as the inseparable linkage between symptoms of the infant, psychosocial risks in the family environment, and parent-child relations. The proposed DSM-5 classification system presents a systematic description of mental health disorders which are relevant for infant psychiatry. However, the proposal has provided rather limited attention to developmental differences and parent-infant relations. Therefore, additional classification systems, like the Zero-to-Three (DC: 0-3R), are strongly recommended. In terms of assessment and in accordance with the guidelines of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, infant psychiatrists have to consider the close relation between somatic and mental health and the interplay between behaviors of the caregiver and the infant. Therefore, the assessment has to be multidisciplinary and relationship based. A standard assessment in infancy includes a clinical interview, behavior observations, caregiver questionnaires, and a pediatric screening. All assessments should pay attention to motor, cognitive, language, and social-emotional development. Because infant development is embedded in the family context, socio-economic factors, parents' mental problems, including drug abuse, domestic violence, and trauma history should be assessed. The treatment has to be oriented toward symptoms and development and has to address underlying medical conditions. The focus should be on parent-child interactions.

We update our previous review [Stringaris in Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry 20(2):61-66, 2011] and also present relevant neurobiological evidence. Most findings so far suggests that chronic, severe irritability is not a developmental presentation of mania. The diagnostic status of brief duration hypomania is less clear, with some evidence in support of its clinical relevance to BP.

While there has been some exciting empirical work on objective measures of physical health, relatively little published research combines physical, cognitive, and psychological assessments in large, randomly selected, community-based samples to assess self-rated successful aging.\nIn the Successful AGing Evaluation (SAGE) study, the authors used a structured multicohort design to assess successful aging in 1,006 community-dwelling adults in San Diego County, ages 50-99 years, with oversampling of people over 80. A modified version of random-digit dialing was used to recruit subjects. Evaluations included a 25-minute telephone interview followed by a comprehensive mail-in survey of physical, cognitive, and psychological domains, including positive psychological traits and self-rated successful aging, scaled from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest).\nThe mean age of the respondents was 77.3 years. Their mean self-rating of successful aging was 8.2, and older age was associated with a higher rating, despite worsening physical and cognitive functioning. The best multiple regression model achieved, using all the potential correlates, accounted for 30% of the variance in the score for self-rated successful aging and included resilience, depression, physical functioning, and age (entering the regression model in that order).\nResilience and depression had significant associations with self-rated successful aging, with effects comparable in size to that for physical health. While no causality can be inferred from cross-sectional data, increasing resilience and reducing depression might have effects on successful aging as strong as that of reducing physical disability, suggesting an important role for psychiatry in promoting successful aging."}, {"Title": "3D PET image reconstruction including both motion correction and registration directly into an MR or stereotaxic spatial atlas.", "Abstract": "This work explores the feasibility and impact of including both the motion correction and the image registration transformation parameters from positron emission tomography (PET) image space to magnetic resonance (MR), or stereotaxic, image space within the system matrix of PET image reconstruction. This approach is motivated by the fields of neuroscience and psychiatry, where PET is used to investigate differences in activation patterns between different groups of participants, requiring all images to be registered to a common spatial atlas. Currently, image registration is performed after image reconstruction which introduces interpolation effects into the final image. Furthermore, motion correction (also requiring registration) introduces a further level of interpolation, and the overall result of these operations can lead to resolution degradation and possibly artifacts. It is important to note that performing such operations on a post-reconstruction basis means, strictly speaking, that the final images are not ones which maximize the desired objective function (e.g. maximum likelihood (ML), or maximum a posteriori reconstruction (MAP)). To correctly seek parameter estimates in the desired spatial atlas which are in accordance with the chosen reconstruction objective function, it is necessary to include the transformation parameters for both motion correction and registration within the system modeling stage of image reconstruction. Such an approach not only respects the statistically chosen objective function (e.g. ML or MAP), but furthermore should serve to reduce the interpolation effects. To evaluate the proposed method, this work investigates registration (including motion correction) using 2D and 3D simulations based on the high resolution research tomograph (HRRT) PET scanner geometry, with and without resolution modeling, using the ML expectation maximization (MLEM) reconstruction algorithm. The quality of reconstruction was assessed using bias-variance and root mean squared error analyses, comparing the proposed method to conventional post-reconstruction registration methods. An overall reduction in bias (for a cold region: from 41% down to 31% (2D) and 97% down to 65% (3D), and for a hot region: from 11% down to 8% (2D) and from 16% down to 14% (3D)) and in root mean squared error analyses (for a cold region: from 43% to 37% (2D) and from 97% to 65% (3D), and for a hot region: from 11% to 9% (2D) and from 16% down to 14% (3D)) in reconstructed regional mean activities (full regions of interest; all with statistical significance: p < 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-10)) is found when including the motion correction and registration in the system matrix of the MLEM reconstruction, with resolution modeling. However, this improvement in performance comes with an extra computational cost of about 40\u00a0min. In this context, this work constitutes an important step toward the goal of estimating parameters of interest directly from the raw Poisson-distributed PET data, and hence toward the complete elimination of post-processing steps."}, {"Title": "[Follow-up of a 16-year-old adolescent with early-onset schizophrenia and catatonic symptoms].", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to underline the need of a systematic monitoring (1) of atypical antipsychotics and (2) of catatonic symptoms in child psychiatry. We present in this paper the clinical history of a 16-year-old adolescent inpatient needing a prescription of atypical antipsychotic drug. We present the most relevant results of our clinical monitoring over 7 months.\nA 16-year-old Caucasian male adolescent, by the name of Paul, was admitted in August 2009 to an Adolescent University Psychiatry Unit for an acute psychotic disorder. On admission, he presented paranoid delusion, auditory hallucinations and impulsive movements. The score on the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) was 17 (the threshold score for the diagnosis of catatonic symptoms is 2). Laboratory tests showed the lack of blood toxic levels, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level was 684 IU/L. Paul was treated with clonazepam (0.05 mg/kg/d). This particular day was considered to be day #1 of the clinical drug monitoring. Immediately after, regular follow-up of catatonic symptoms was performed. On day #15, the CPK level returned to normal with improvement of clinical catatonia but with still a score of 4 on the BFCRS scale. Auditory hallucinations and delusion persisted. Risperidone treatment was begun (1mg/d and 1.5mg/d after 24 hours), associated with oral clonazepam (0.05 mg/kg/d). On day #17, after 48 hours of improvement of delusion, the catatonic symptoms rapidly worsened. Risperidone was stopped; Paul was transferred to intensive care where he was treated with clonazepam IV (0.1mg/kg/d). The score on BFCRS scale was 20, Paul presented no fever and the CPK level was below 170 IU/L. The diagnosis was a relapse of the catatonic episode, which was caused by the administration of risperidone. On day #24, no improvement in the state of catatonia was obtained. The treatment was changed with the following combination of medicine: clonazepam (0.1mg/kg/d)-lorazepam (5mg/d)-carbamazepine (10mg/kg/d). With this combination, the state of catatonia improved quickly and on day #31, he was transferred to the adolescent psychiatry unit. However, delusion and hallucinations persisted; a treatment with olanzapine was started at 5mg/d and then progressively increased to 20mg/d for 10 days. On day #115, after 3 months with olanzapine, no improvement of the hallucinatory and delusional symptoms was observed; the diagnosis of early-onset refractory schizophrenia was established. The Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) confirmed the good compliance; clozapine was introduced and progressively increased up to 250 mg/d. On day #199, after 3 months under clozapine (250 mg/d), the speech was coherent and delusion was rare. During this period, no relapse of the catatonic state was observed.\nIn this case, the BFCRS scale was sensitive to catatonic symptom diagnosis. CPK levels vary differently for each atypical antipsychotic and are not a specific complication indicator. In complex cases, the TDM seems useful when choosing atypical antipsychotics.\nThe association of two benzodiazepines (clonazepam-lorazepam) with carbamazepin allowed the improvement of catatonic symptoms. Plasma levels of atypical antipsychotics helped the practitioner in deciding the type of care required: plasma levels confirmed the patient's treatment adherence and thus reinforced the choice of clozapine."}, {"Title": "Mechanical and pharmacological restraints in acute psychiatric wards--why and how are they used?", "Abstract": "Restraint use has been reported to be common in acute psychiatry, but empirical research is scarce concerning why and how restraints are used.

The distribution of restraint categories for the 371 restrained patients was as follows: mechanical restraint, 47.2%; mechanical and pharmacological restraint together, 35.3%; and pharmacological restraint, 17.5%. The most commonly reported reason for restraint was assault (occurred or imminent). It increased the likelihood of resulting in concomitant pharmacological restraint. Female patients had shorter duration of mechanical restraint than men. Age above 49 and female gender increased the likelihood of pharmacological versus mechanical restraint, whereas being restrained due to assault weakened this association. Episodes with mechanical restraint and coinciding pharmacological restraint lasted longer than mechanical restraint used separately, and were less common among patients with a personality disorder. Diagnoses, age and reason for restraint independently increased the likelihood for being subjected to specific types of restraint. Female gender predicted type of restraint and duration of episodes."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric services in the community? The German public's opinion in 1990 and 2011.", "Abstract": "Background.

Goethe was one of the most creative writers, productive scientists, and effective statesmen that ever lived. His descriptions of feelings, emotions, and mental states related to anxieties, depressive episodes, dysthymia, and creativity are unique in their phenomenological precision and richness. His life and work can thus serve as an excellent example enhancing our understanding of the relationship between anxiety, depression and creativity. Furthermore, he described (self-)therapeutic strategies that reinforce and refine modern views.\nGoethe's self-assessments in his works and letters, and the descriptions by others are analyzed under the perspective of current psychiatric classification. His therapeutic techniques and recommendations are compared with cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and existential psychotherapy to amplify modern concepts of psychotherapy.\nFrom a scientific perspective, several distinctive depressive episodes can be diagnosed in Goethe's life. They were characterized by extended depressive moods, lack of drive, and loss of interest and self-esteem combined with social retreat. Goethe displayed diffuse and phobic anxieties as well as dysthymia. His (self-)therapeutic strategies were: (a) the systematic use of helping alliances, (b) behavioral techniques, (c) cognitive reflection on meanings and beliefs, (d) psychodynamic and psychoanalytic remembering, repeating, and working through, and (e) existential striving for self-actualization, social commitment, meaning, and creativity.\nIn Goethe's life, creative incubation, illumination, and elaboration appear to have been associated with psychic instability and dysthymia, sometimes with depressive episodes in a clinical sense. On the one hand, his creative work was triggered by anxieties, dysthymia, and depressive moods. On the other hand, his creativity helped him to cope with psychic disorders and suicidal tendencies. Furthermore, Goethe described psychotherapeutic strategies that resemble modern techniques. He integrated relational, behavioral, cognitive, psychodynamic, and existential techniques and attitudes. These modern psychotherapeutic approaches can be exemplified and enhanced by reflecting upon the (self-)therapeutic efforts of one of the most creative persons that have ever lived. Hermeneutics as the art of communication and understanding derived from Goethe's (self-)therapy and creative works can serve as a meta-theoretical framework for the integration of different psychotherapeutic approaches."}, {"Title": "[Liaison psychiatry nurse: the development of supervision in somatic medicine].", "Abstract": "Over the years, somatic care has become increasingly specialized. Furthermore, a rising number of patients requiring somatic care also present with a psychiatric comorbidity. As a consequence, the time and resources needed to care for these patients can interfere with the course of somatic treatment and influence the patient-caregiver relationship. In the light of these observations, the Liaison Psychiatry Unit at the University Hospital in Lausanne (CHUV) has educated its nursing staff in order to strengthen its action within the general care hospital. What has been developed is a reflexive approach through supervision of somatic staff, in order to improve the efficiency of liaison psychiatry interventions with the caregivers in charge of patients. The kind of supervision we have developed is the result of a real partnership with somatic staff. Besides, in order to better understand the complexity of interactions between the two systems involved, the patient's and the caregivers', we use several theoretical references in an integrative manner. PSYCHOANALYTICAL REFERENCE: The psychoanalytical model allows us to better understand the dynamics between the supervisor and the supervised group in order to contain and give meaning to the affects arising in the supervision space. \"Containing function\" and \"transitional phenomena\" refer to the experience in which emotions can find a space where they can be taken in and processed in a secure and supportive manner. These concepts, along with that of the \"psychic envelope\", were initially developed to explain the psychological development of the baby in its early interactions with its mother or its surrogate. In the field of supervision, they allow us to be aware of these complex phenomena and the diverse qualities to which a supervisor needs to resort, such as attention, support and incentive, in order to offer a secure environment. SYSTEMIC REFERENCE: A new perspective of the patient's complexity is revealed by the group's dynamics. The supervisor's attention is mainly focused on the work of affects. However, these are often buried under a defensive shell, serving as a temporary protection, which prevents the caregiver from recognizing his or her own emotions, thereby enhancing the difficulties in the relationship with the patient. Whenever the work of putting emotions into words fail, we use \"sculpting\", a technique derived from the systemic model. Through the use of this type of analogical language, affects can emerge without constraint or feelings of danger. Through \"playing\" in that \"transitional space\", new exchanges appear between group members and allow new behaviors to be conceived. In practice, we ask the supervisee who is presenting a complex situation, to design a spatial representation of his or her understanding of the situation, through the display of characters significant to the situation: the patient, somatic staff members, relatives of the patient, etc. In silence, the supervisee shapes the characters into postures and arranges them in the room. Each sculpted character is identified, named, and positioned, with his or her gaze being set in a specific direction. Finally the sculptor shapes him or herself in his or her own role. When the sculpture is complete and after a few moments of fixation, we ask participants to express themselves about their experience. By means of this physical representation, participants to the sculpture discover perceptions and feelings that were unknown up to then. Hence from this analogical representation a reflection and hypotheses of understanding can arise and be developed within the group.\nThrough the use of the concepts of \"containing function\" and \"transitional space\" we position ourselves in the scope of the encounter and the dialog. Through the use of the systemic technique of \"sculpting\" we promote the process of understanding, rather than that of explaining, which would place us in the position of experts. The experience of these encounters has shown us that what we need to focus on is indeed what happens in this transitional space in terms of dynamics and process. The encounter and the sharing of competencies both allow a new understanding of the situation at hand, which has, of course, to be verified in the reality of the patient-caregiver relationship. It is often a source of adjustment for interpersonal skills to recover its containing function in order to enable caregiver to better respond to the patient's needs."}, {"Title": "Appropriating depression: biomedicalizing Ayurvedic psychiatry in Kerala, India.", "Abstract": "The appropriation of biopsychiatric concepts such as depression, and their reframing in clinical and academic discussions, are important parts of the revitalization of bh\u016bt vidy\u0101 as Ayurvedic psychiatry. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Kerala from 2009 to 2011, in this article we explore the process and the controversies of translating and correlating the biopsychiatric notion of depression, as a discrete and biologic pathological entity, with Ayurvedic notions of body, mind, and mental distress. Depression, conceptualized as a neurochemical imbalance, is, we argue, relatively compatible with Ayurvedic notions of a fluent body and mind, and so is easier to correlate with Ayurvedic concepts of do[Formula: see text]ic imbalances and blockages of channels than the former psychoanalytically dominated model of depression. The appropriation of depression within Ayurvedic discourse challenges the dichotomy of universal and culture-specific disorders, and this has a significant impact on mental health programs in Kerala."}, {"Title": "Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.", "Abstract": "The DSM-5 list of diagnoses concerning schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders is expected to be revised and graduated from mild to severe. The proposed changes for the diagnosis of schizophrenia affect demands for characteristic symptoms, clarify relation to pervasive developmental disorders, and eliminate the classic subtypes of schizophrenia. A dimensional assessment will be measured on a 0-4 point scale. It is recommended that the concept of attenuated psychosis syndrome is further investigated. The propositions affecting characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia might increase diagnostic reliability and validity, but it is estimated to exclude about 2 % of patients currently diagnosed with DSM-IV schizophrenia from fulfilling criteria for DSM-5 schizophrenia. It might generate a problem for future young patients if the changes concerning demands on characteristic symptoms turn out to be more restrictive, leaving out a percentage of patients with psychotic symptoms from a diagnosis of schizophrenia; which in practice opens possibilities for intensive treatment options. On the other hand, not including attenuated psychosis syndrome at the present might protect patients from stigmatization and pharmacological treatment on poor indication. The introduction of dimensional assessments may make schizophrenia subtyping redundant and has the potential to enrich clinical practice and bridge communication between child and adolescent and adult psychiatry. The most recent guidelines for assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia are from 2001. They provide differentiated recommendations regarding diagnostics, assessment of symptoms and functioning and treatment strategies. There is an urgent need for updated guidelines in this field, especially concerning specific treatment guidelines."}, {"Title": "Obesity as a defense mechanism.", "Abstract": "As the rate of obesity and bariatric surgery rise, various psychosocial etiologies contributing to obesity are being explored, and it is not uncommon to discover that a patient has been a victim of past abuse.\nA 37-year-old female was hospitalized for intractable nausea and vomiting following a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass performed a month and a half prior. After ruling out all medical etiologies, psychiatry was consulted due to a history of panic attacks, and to evaluate for a psychosomatic etiology.\nDuring the initial consultation, it was elicited that the patient had been the victim of a date rape as a teen, which resulted in dramatic weight gain and obesity. Following a comprehensive medical workup, brief psychodynamic psychotherapy, and the initiation of pharmacotherapy, the patient had a resolution of her symptoms, and at a 2 month follow-up, remained asymptomatic.\nPrior to surgery, patients should be questioned about any history of abuse by utilizing a structured diagnostic questionnaire, such as the Weight and Lifestyle Inventory (WALI). To prevent minimization, individuals with a history of abuse should be screened more thoroughly, and psychiatric involvement should be an intrinsic component of the follow-up care as abused patients may also be more sensitive to complaints as they lose weight. Psychiatric involvement can be a useful adjunctive treatment while medical etiologies are being ruled out, rather than after they have been ruled out."}, {"Title": "Cytochrome P450-mediated drug metabolism in the brain.", "Abstract": "Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) metabolize many drugs that act on the central nervous system (CNS), such as antidepressants and antipsychotics; drugs of abuse; endogenous neurochemicals, such as serotonin and dopamine; neurotoxins; and carcinogens. This takes place primarily in the liver, but metabolism can also occur in extrahepatic organs, including the brain. This is important for CNS-acting drugs, as variation in brain CYP-mediated metabolism may be a contributing factor when plasma levels do not predict drug response. This review summarizes the characterization of CYPs in the brain, using examples from the CYP2 subfamily, and discusses sources of variation in brain CYP levels and metabolism. Some recent experiments are described that demonstrate how changes in brain CYP metabolism can influence drug response, toxicity and drug-induced behaviours. Advancing knowledge of brain CYP-mediated metabolism may help us understand why patients respond differently to drugs used in psychiatry and predict risk for psychiatric disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and substance abuse."}, {"Title": "Drug screens for psychiatric patients in the emergency department: evaluation and recommendations.", "Abstract": "To better understand how toxicology screening for psychiatric patients in the emergency department (ED) setting affects diagnostic decisions.\nRetrospective chart review of 439 ED visits of adult patients receiving psychiatry consultations at two hospitals, one an academic medical center (n =224) and the other a community hospital (n = 220), between July 2008 and February 2009.

Factors which contribute to these difficulties include imprecise understanding of etiology, syndromal nature of many disorders and overlap in diagnostic criteria between conditions, medical and psychiatric comorbidity and high rates of noncompliance to treatment either due to lack of efficacy or adverse effects. In addition to genetics and known biological factors, the severity and presentation of many psychiatric conditions may be influenced by psychosocial factors, which in turn can affect treatment outcomes. Currently, the selection of medications for a given patient in psychiatry is primarily based on a trial and error process; thus, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can improve diagnostic homogeneity and provide useful prognostic information. Pharmacogenetics has the potential, in combination with other approaches, to enhance both care at an individual level as well as in drug development by improving efficacy and minimizing drug-induced side effects."}, {"Title": "Sexual sadism: current diagnostic vagueness and the benefit of behavioral definitions.", "Abstract": "The phenomenon of sexual sadism was first scientifically described by Richard von Krafft-Ebing in 1999 as a sexual preference disorder that focuses on the infliction of suffering, pain, or humiliation to achieve sexual gratification. The present article reviews the historical development of the term sexual sadism, including the current descriptive nosology of psychiatric classification. Despite clear definitions that specify the sexual objects, duration, and distress necessary for a disorder, evidence for the diagnostic reliability for sexual sadism in the forensic domain is mixed. We argue that the reliance on the patient's willingness to divulge corresponding violent sexual fantasies is the Achilles' heel of the diagnosis. In an attempt to improve agreement across diagnosticians, we argue for the use of behavioral indicators. We summarize the extant research on the Severe Sexual Sadism Scale (SESAS), which is a file-based observer rating of pertinent crime-scene actions. We conclude that the analysis of crime-scene behavior, as achieved with the SESAS, can provide a useful complement for the clinical diagnosis in forensic psychiatry and psychology."}, {"Title": "Personality disorders in consultation-liaison psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Liaison psychiatrists treat patients who present with self-harm, with medically unexplained symptoms (MUSs) and physical illnesses with psychological comorbidity.

Patients who have self-harmed have a high rate of personality disorder, but there is little research on how liaison psychiatrists can engage these patients in appropriate treatments. Most patients with MUSs or a functional somatic syndrome do not have a personality disorder, but the prevalence is probably higher than in the general population.

In this article, we aimed to provide an overview of areas where nanotechnology is applied and how they could be extended to care for psychiatric illnesses. The main applications of nanotechnology in psychiatry are (i) pharmacology. There are two main difficulties in neuropharmacology: drugs have to pass the blood-brain barrier and then to be internalized by targeted cells. Nanoparticles could increase drugs bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, especially improving safety and efficacy of psychotropic drugs. Liposomes, nanosomes, nanoparticle polymers, nanobubbles are some examples of this targeted drug delivery. Nanotechnologies could also add new pharmacological properties, like nanoshells and dendrimers (ii) living analysis. Nanotechnology provides technical assistance to in vivo imaging or metabolome analysis (iii) central nervous system modeling. Research teams have succeeded to modelize inorganic synapses and mimick synaptic behavior, a step essential for further creation of artificial neural systems. Some nanoparticle assemblies present the same small worlds and free-scale networks architecture as cortical neural networks. Nanotechnologies and quantum physics could be used to create models of artificial intelligence and mental illnesses. We are not about to see a concrete application of nanomedicine in daily psychiatric practice. Even if nanotechnologies are promising, their safety is still inconsistent and this must be kept in mind.

We conducted a meta-analysis on the experimental evidence regarding the capacity of the \u00df-blocker propranolol to block the consolidation/reconsolidation of emotional memories in healthy adults.\nSelected studies consisted of randomized, double-blind experiments assessing long-term memory for emotional material in healthy adults and involved at least 1 propranolol and 1 placebo condition. We searched PsycInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, PILOTS, Google Scholar and clinicaltrials.org for eligible studies from the period 1995-2012. Ten consolidation (n = 259) and 8 reconsolidation (n = 308) experiments met the inclusion criteria. We calculated effect sizes (Hedges g) using a random effects model.\nCompared with placebo, propranolol given before memory consolidation reduced subsequent recall for negatively valenced stories, pictures and word lists (Hedges g = 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.14-0.74). Propranolol before reconsolidation also reduced subsequent recall for negatively valenced emotional words and the expression of cue-elicited fear responses (Hedges g = 0.56, 95% CI 0.13-1.00).\nLimitations include the moderate number of studies examining the influence of propranolol on emotional memory consolidation and reconsolidation in healthy adults and the fact that most samples consisted entirely of young adults, which may limit the ecological validity of results.\nPropranolol shows promise in reducing subsequent memory for new or recalled emotional material in healthy adults. However, future studies will need to investigate whether more powerful idiosyncratic emotional memories can also be weakened and whether this weakening can bring about long-lasting symptomatic relief in clinical populations, such as patients with posttraumatic stress or other event-related disorders."}, {"Title": "Primary care support for youth mental health: a preliminary evidence base for Ireland's Mid-West.", "Abstract": "Mental and substance use disorders are leading causes of morbidity.

Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, drug trials and the construction of depression as non-chronic were mutually constituted.\nHamilton Rating Scale for Depression framed depression and its sufferers in new ways, leading psychiatrists to understand illness as a treatable episode, rather than a life course condition. As such, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression served the interests of psychiatrists and psychiatry in its new era of drug therapy outside the mental hospital.

However, differences between pre-COI and post-COI graduates' prescribing of heavily promoted medications were larger for maximally restrictive programs than both minimally restrictive programs [-4.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval (CI), -7.0, -1.6] and moderately restrictive programs (-3.6 percentage points; 95% CI, -6.2, -1.1). The difference in prescribing reformulations was larger for maximally restrictive programs than minimally restrictive programs (-3.0 percentage points; 95% CI, -5.3, -0.7). Results were consistent for prescribing of brand drugs.\nThis study provides the first empirical evidence of the effects of COI policies. Our results suggest that COI policies can help inoculate physicians against persuasive aspects of pharmaceutical promotion. Further research should assess whether these policies affect other drug classes and physician specialties similarly."}, {"Title": "Psychoactive bacteria Lactobacillus rhamnosus (JB-1) elicits rapid frequency facilitation in vagal afferents.", "Abstract": "Mounting evidence supports the influence of the gut microbiome on the local enteric nervous system and its effects on brain chemistry and relevant behavior. Vagal afferents are involved in some of these effects. We previously showed that ingestion of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus (JB-1) caused extensive neurochemical changes in the brain and behavior that were abrogated by prior vagotomy. Because information can be transmitted to the brain via primary afferents encoded as neuronal spike trains, our goal was to record those induced by JB-1 in vagal afferents in the mesenteric nerve bundle and thus determine the nature of the signals sent to the brain. Male Swiss Webster mice jejunal segments were cannulated ex vivo, and serosal and luminal compartments were perfused separately. Bacteria were added intraluminally. We found no evidence for translocation of labeled bacteria across the epithelium during the experiment. We recorded extracellular multi- and single-unit neuronal activity with glass suction pipettes. Within minutes of application, JB-1 increased the constitutive single- and multiunit firing rate of the mesenteric nerve bundle, but Lactobacillus salivarius (a negative control) or media alone were ineffective. JB-1 significantly augmented multiunit discharge responses to an intraluminal distension pressure of 31 hPa. Prior subdiaphragmatic vagotomy abolished all of the JB-1-evoked effects. This detailed exploration of the neuronal spike firing that encodes behavioral signaling to the brain may be useful to identify effective psychoactive bacteria and thereby offer an alternative new perspective in the field of psychiatry and comorbid conditions."}, {"Title": "Outreach and support in south London (OASIS), 2001-2011: ten years of early diagnosis and treatment for young individuals at high clinical risk for psychosis.", "Abstract": "Prevention of psychosis has become a major objective of modern clinical psychiatry.

Although early intervention strategies in schizophrenia have been extensively studied, recent efforts to identify individuals who are at increased risk for other disorders, such as bipolar disorder, have gained significant interest. There is some available data to suggest that cognitive deficits may precede the onset of mania; therefore, it would be beneficial to identify cognitive predictors of bipolar disorder in an effort to facilitate early intervention.\nWe conducted a literature review of conscript, cohort, high-risk, family-based and first-episode mania studies that assessed neurocognition in order to ascertain potential cognitive predictors of bipolar disorder.\nThere is little evidence that individuals at risk for bipolar disorder exhibit deficits in global measures of neurocognition, such as IQ. However, deficits in specific neurocognitive domains, including verbal memory and executive function, appear to represent potential predictors of bipolar disorder.\nThese conclusions are preliminary; however, they provide a starting point for future work.

All countries allocate a significant portion of resources to the health sector. In 2008, the gross domestic product of Palestine was estimated to be at $6.108bn (current price) or about $1697 per capita. Health expenditures are estimated at 15.6% of the gross domestic product, almost as much as those of Germany, Japan and other developed countries. The numbers of hospitals, hospital beds and primary healthcare centers in the country have all increased. The Ministry of Health (MOH) currently operates 27 of 76 hospitals, with a total of 3074 beds, which represent 61% of total beds of all hospitals in the Palestinian Authorities area. Also, the MOH is operating 453 of 706 Primary Health Care facilities. By 2007, about 40\u2009000 people were employed in different sectors of the health system, with 33% employed by the MOH.\nThis purpose of this study was to develop a financing strategy to help cover some or all of the costs involved in operating such institutions and to estimate the unit cost of primary and secondary programs and departments.\nA retrospective study was carried out on data from government hospitals and primary healthcare centers to identify and analyze the costs and output (patient-related services) and to estimate the unit cost of health services provided by hospitals and PHCs during the year 2008. All operating costs are assigned and allocated to the departments at MOH hospitals and primary health care centers (PPHCs) and are identified as overhead departments, intermediate-service and final-service departments. Intermediate-service departments provide procedures and services to patients in the final-service departments. The costs of the overhead departments are distributed to the intermediate-service and final-service departments through a step-down method, according to allocation criteria devised to resemble as closely as possible the actual use of resources by each of the departments. The data were analyzed using spss. Data cleaning was carried out by cross-validating the results through conducting cross-tabulations between the hospital/center and section/program to identify errors from the data collection or entry process. Depreciation of assets and the consumption of capital costs are ignored in this study, as it is difficult to evaluate the MOH facilities owing to a lack of recording of depreciation of assets or other costs of servicing capital assets.\nInpatient costs contributed about 75% of all costs, whereas outpatient services contributed the remaining 25% of total costs. The average cost per visit was $13.00 for outpatient departments, whereas the average cost per patient day for inpatient departments was $90.00. As for the unit cost for each department, intensive care unit and intermediate care unit services were the highest among all categories of daily hospital services ($208.00). This is in contrast to surgical operations ($124.00), specialized surgeries ($106.00), delivery department ($99.00), orthopedics ($98.50) and general surgery ($85.00). The lowest unit cost was found in the neonatology department ($72.00). In PHCs, the unit cost per visit was highest for psychiatry programs ($26.00), followed by other programs ($21.50), chronic diseases ($21.00), maternal and child health ($11.50), preventive programs ($9.00) and general medicine ($6.50).

PRS has been proposed as a new diagnostic entity in child and adolescent psychiatry, although the diagnostic criteria are debated. In the past 10\u00a0years there has been an increase in PRS symptoms among asylum-seeking children and adolescents in Sweden. Here, we describe five cases of PRS among asylum-seeking children and adolescents.\nThree females and 2 males, 7-17\u00a0years of age with the clinical picture of PRS, treated as inpatients at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Malm\u00f6, Sweden, 2002-2010, were analysed on the basis of their medical records.

Up to 45% of all patients are classified as having more than one psychiatric disorder. These high rates of comorbidity have led to a debate concerning the interpretation of this phenomenon. Some authors emphasize the problematic character of the high rates of comorbidity because they indicate absent zones of rarities. Others consider comorbid conditions to be a validator for a particular reclassification of diseases. In this paper we will show that those at first sight contrasting interpretations of comorbidity are based on similar assumptions about disease models. The underlying ideas are that firstly high rates of comorbidity are the result of the absence of causally defined diseases in psychiatry, and second that causal disease models are preferable to non-causal disease models. We will argue that there are good reasons to seek after causal understanding of psychiatric disorders, but that causal disease models will not rule out high rates of comorbidity--neither in psychiatry, nor in medicine in general. By bringing to the fore these underlying assumptions, we hope to clear the ground for a different understanding of comorbidity, and of models for psychiatric diseases."}, {"Title": "Innovative trends in the design of therapeutic trials in psychopharmacology and psychotherapy.", "Abstract": "The standard randomized controlled trial design is still based on the acute disease model. This is in sharp contrast with the fact that the patient is likely to have experienced other treatments before, that may actually modify clinical course and responsiveness. The current standard of therapeutic trial in psychiatry is represented by the large, multi-center, controlled randomized trial with broad inclusion criteria, and little attention to other factors such as the clinical history of patients and comorbidity. The heterogeneous features of these patients would then affect the outcome of the trial. Conflicting results among randomized controlled trials can represent a spectrum of outcomes, based on different patient groups, more than bias or random variability. If a treatment is tested by a series of small trials with inclusion criteria for specific characteristics (including treatment history, subgroups and comorbidity), we may have a better knowledge of its indications and contraindications. Further, there is increasing need of expanding the content of customary clinical information, by including evaluation of variables such as stress, lifestyle, well-being, illness behavior and psychological symptoms. These joint strategies would actually constitute a paradigm shift in psychopharmacology and psychotherapy research."}, {"Title": "[Validation of the dialectal Arabic version of Barratt's impulsivity scale, the BIS-11].", "Abstract": "Impulsivity is a symptom of several disorders such as personality disorder, bipolar disorder, suicidal behaviour, substance use disorders, schizophrenia...Forensic psychiatry is particularly concerned with impulsivity. It increases the risk of violence among clinical populations and figures in various instruments such as the HCR-20, the VRAG and the PCL-R to assess violence risk. It is one of many dimensions that can lead to aggressive behaviour among psychiatric patients. The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), in its 11th version, is a 30-item self-report instrument that helps assessing impulsivity trait among normal and clinical populations. The BIS is the most commonly administered self-assessment of impulsiveness. As of March 2009, there have been 551 citations of the BIS-11 among many publications. The purpose of the present study is to examine the psychometric properties of the Arabic translation of the BIS-11th version in a sample of the general population and to identify an eventual correlation between impulsivity and socio-demographic characteristics.\nThis is a prospective study conducted over a five-month period, from June to October 2010, and including 134 persons from the general population having provided their informed consent. The dialectal Arabic version was carried out by translation from English to dialectal Arabic followed by a back translation to English. Some questions were modified to be understood by a population with low education. After giving their verbal informed consent, the participants filled in the Arabic version of the BIS-11. For the illiterate, responses and quotations were performed by the interviewer. The persons were also asked to fill in socio-demographic data. Cronbach's coefficient was calculated, and then we assessed impulsivity prevalence and a correlation between demographic features and impulsivity scores. For the analyses, the statistical software SPSS 11 was used.\nThe sex ratio is 1.02. Most of the interviewed persons were 20 to 49 years old. Around 25.4% of the sample were analphabets, 32.1% had primary education, 29.1% had secondary education and 13.4% were undergraduates. The Cronbach's alpha was respectively 0.66 for attention, 0.72 for motor impulsivity, 0.61 for lack of planning and 0.78 for total impulsivity. Factor analysis identified three factors explaining the total variance of 32.6%. Impulsivity prevalence was 9%. We did not find significant correlation between demographic features and impulsivity scores.\nLimits of the study: scale stability over time was not verified. This was due to the difficulty in re-inviting the same persons to fulfil the scale a second time. Because no instrument for assessing exists in Arabic, comparison was not possible between the translated Barratt's scale and the reference. Our sample represents the general population. This choice was justified in order to study an eventual correlation between impulsiveness and socio-demographic characteristics. We must mention difficulties when asking persons with low education to complete the scale, what may have caused a poorer performance of the scale due to difficulties in understanding some questions. Moreover, we had chosen a non-clinical sample. The validation of the scale could be performed in a clinical population. The measure of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) fell within an acceptable range (0.61-0.78), suggesting that the Arabic version of the BIS-11 is reliable. Exploratory factor analysis of the current version identified three factors, but these factors differed from those of other translated versions.\nThere is growing interest in the impulsivity concept. Forensic psychiatry is particularly concerned by impulsivity. In fact, it is related to psychiatric patients' violence. Impulsivity also reveals the problem of responsibility assessment in psychiatric expertise and the dangerousness of psychiatric patients. The Arabic version of the BIS-11 has a good apparent and internal consistency. This version could be useful in assessing psychiatric patient's dangerousness."}, {"Title": "Integrative neuroimaging in mood disorders.", "Abstract": "Neuroimaging has become a central technique of biological psychiatry and is uniquely suited to assess functional and structural brain changes in psychiatric patients in vivo.

We also survey recent progress in imaging-guided deep brain stimulation (DBS), imaging-based (neurofeedback) therapies and studies looking at their convergent anatomical targets. These new interventional techniques, which aim to modulate brain circuits of emotion and motivation highlighted by functional imaging studies, have shown promising effects in several small studies.\nThe mapping of brain patterns associated with risk to develop mood disorders may pave the way for diagnostic/prognostic applications of neuroimaging.

An anonymous questionnaire covering five domains (academic teaching, psychoanalysis, extra-academic training, interest in a more developed model of training, supervision) was sent by the French Federative Association of Psychiatrists Trainees (AFFEP) to all French psychiatrist trainees, through their local trainee associations (n=26).\nThe questionnaire was answered by 869 of the 1334 psychiatry residents (65%). The vast majority of the trainees reported being interested in psychotherapy, but 75% thought that their training in psychotherapy (psychoanalysis, cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT] and systemic therapy) is insufficient. In 20 of the 26 universities, more than half of the trainees reported that their training was insufficient in the three fields; in four universities, more than half of the trainees were satisfied with at least one field. Yet, satisfaction rates were very different among universities: for example, 27% were satisfied with their psychoanalytic training in Paris and 87% in Strasbourg; 7% were satisfied with their CBT training in Strasbourg, but 65% in Nice. The vast majority (97%) believes that supervision about therapeutic relationship is necessary during residency rotations in the hospital. More than three quarters (78%) would like to have supervision at least twice a month. Yet, only 51% of respondents have such supervision. Once again, large disparities were observed between different Academies: for example 74% had supervision in Montpellier, but only 29% in Marseille. The vast majority (95%) of trainees would like a two-phase model of training (general theoretical teaching plus in-depth training in one or more methods), which is different to the current training model.\nOur results show a clear discrepancy between the importance of training in psychotherapy for psychiatrists, the interest of psychiatry students for these therapies, and the very high rate of dissatisfaction for the training received, as well as the rate of students supervised during their training period at the hospital. These results differ from what is observed in other countries, where satisfaction rates are much higher among students, and various psychotherapy training methods are proposed in a much more homogeneous manner. More research is required to understand the reasons for these difficulties with the psychotherapy training of psychiatrists in France, and to propose new models of training to improve this situation."}, {"Title": "Four-year outcome of mild cognitive impairment: the contribution of executive dysfunction.", "Abstract": "The contribution of executive cognition (EC) to the prediction of incident dementia remains unclear.

A pilot study].", "Abstract": "Functional and behavioral disorders are the most frequent reasons for consultation in infant psychiatry, but there are still few studies about the efficacy of parents-child psychotherapies. Functional disorders appear to be easier to treat than behavioral disorders. The aim of this study was: (1) to assess outcome after a brief psychotherapy in a population of 49 infants aged 3 to 30 months, presenting functional or behavioral disorders; (2) to compare characteristics before therapy and outcomes for children with functional disorders and with behavioral disorders, to have a better understanding of the worse outcome of children with behavioral disorders.\nTwo assessments were performed, one before treatment and the second a month after the end of the therapy including the infant's symptoms (Symptom Check-list), parents' anxious and depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale) and mother-infant interactions (Crittenden Experimental Index of adult-infant relationship). The therapeutic alliance was assessed by the therapist and the parents after the first consultation (Working Alliance Inventory).\nThe assessments after therapy show complete or partial improvement in the child's symptoms, in the mother's anxious and depressive symptoms and in the father's anxious symptoms. During interaction, the mothers become more sensible, the number of controlling and of unresponsive mothers decrease, while the children become more cooperative and less passive. Initial characteristics and outcome are however different according to the type of the child's disorder. The children with behavioral disorders are older and present an association of several symptoms. The disorder onset is later. Their mothers are, before therapy, more anxious and depressive. The therapeutic alliance is weaker. After therapy, despite the fact that their mothers' affective state and that interactive behavior improves, the mothers are more anxious and less sensible, while the children no longer differ from the group without behavioral disorder from the point of view of opposition (assessed during mother-child interaction).\nAlthough this study is limited by the lack of a control group and the sample size, it underlines some particularities of infants and toddlers presenting behavioral disorders and the difficulties involved in their treatment. One can wonder if these characteristics are specific of the behavioral disorders or if they are the result of an older dysfunction, complicated by the developmental evolution of the child and the duration of the difficulties. The small number of cases, among the children with behavioral disorders, presenting a preexistent functional disorder, the absence of difference in the duration of the disorders, and the different disorder's onset plead in favor of the first hypothesis. The behavioral disorders often associate child psychopathology, dysfunctional parents-child-relationships and environmental factors difficult to modify with a brief therapy focused on the relationship.

While combinatory strategies rely on receptor and synaptic mechanisms, it should also be considered that two drugs may also \"interact\" on the long-term to determine more robust changes in neuronal plasticity, which represents a downstream target important for functional recovery.\nThe aim of the study is to investigate neuroadaptive changes set in motion by chronic concomitant administration of the novel antipsychotic lurasidone and the mood stabilizer valproate.\nAnimals were chronically treated with lurasidone, valproate, or the combination of the two drugs and killed 24\u00a0h after the last injection to evaluate alterations of different measures of neuronal plasticity such as the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the immediate early gene Activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein, and the epigenetic regulators HDAC 1, 2, and 5 in dorsal and ventral hippocampus.\nThe results suggest that coadministration of lurasidone and valproate produces, when compared to the single drugs, a larger increase in the expression of BDNF in the ventral hippocampus, through the regulation of specific neurotrophin transcripts. We also found that the histone deacetylases were regulated by the drug combination, suggesting that some of the transcriptional changes may be sustained by epigenetic mechanisms.\nOur results suggest that the beneficial effects associated with combinatory treatment between a second-generation antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer could result from the ability to modulate neuroplastic molecules, whose expression and function is deteriorated in different psychiatric conditions."}, {"Title": "Dichotomizing rating scale scores in psychiatry: a bad idea?", "Abstract": "In psychiatry, the use of rating scales as measures of outcome in clinical trials allows us to generate continuous outcome data, where each individual's outcome is measured in numbers.

We hypothesize that intranasal administration of oxytocin to mothers with depression will influence their parenting related expressed emotion, creating a better basis for sensitive parenting.\nTwenty-five postnatally depressed mothers with infants less than one year participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled within-subject clinical study in 2011. Mothers attended an out-patient perinatal psychiatry setting in NSW, Australia. They received 24 IU of oxytocin alternating with placebo approximately one week apart in random order, prior to completing outcome measures. The outcome measures were the Five Minute Speech Sample, the Self-Assessment Manikin and the Controlled Oral Word Association Test.\nIn the oxytocin condition mothers were sadder (p=.01), and they more often initially described their babies as difficult (p=.038), but they reported that the quality of their relationship with their infant was more positive (p=.036).\nDespite an adequate sample size to answer our central hypothesis, a larger sample may have elucidated a moderating effect of childhood trauma.\nOxytocin did not make depressed mothers happier but their perception of the relationship with their baby improved.

To assess its test-retest reliability, the EPCA was again administered to those patients who were readmitted to hospital at least six months after the first assessment (n=50). To examine its construct validity, some of the most used assessment tools in this research field were also administered.\n[corrected] Inter-rater agreement ranged from k=.90 to k=1. Test-retest reliability was good in the case of suicidal ideation, suicide plans and suicide attempts; however, it was lower in the case of self-harming behaviours and suicidal gestures.

An assessment of the magnitude of drug abuse in India began in the early 1990s and this was followed by a National Survey on Extent, Patterns and Trends of Drug Abuse in 2004. Several models of clinical care have been developed for population subgroups in diverse settings. The centre played an important role in producing data and resource material which helped to scale up opioid substitution treatment in India. A nationwide database on the profile of patients seeking treatment (Drug Abuse Monitoring System) at government drug treatment centres has also been created. The centre has provided valuable inputs for the Government of India's programme planning. Besides clinical studies, research has also focused on pre-clinical studies. Capacity-building is an important priority, with training curricula and resource material being developed for doctors and paramedical staff. Many of these training programmes are conducted in collaboration with other institutions in the country.

A more holistic way of looking at old age suggests transcendence may be an important missing criterion for successful aging.\nTranscendence, a late life developmental process, appears to have a profound effect within the spiritual domain but is an abstract, complex, and unfamiliar concept. A clear understanding of the meaning of transcendence is necessary to explore the concept's usefulness as a potential basis for future interventions to increase successful aging.\nWalker and Avant's method of concept analysis was adapted to analyze literature from philosophy, theology, developmental psychology, sociology, psychiatry, and nursing in order to gain a thorough understanding of transcendence.\nAntecedents, attributes, referents, and consequences of transcendence were identified and then displayed in a conceptual model. A definition of transcendence in relation to successful aging was synthesized from the analysis.\nThe concept analysis suggested transcendence may provide a theoretical foundation for development of potentially cost-effective, efficacious interventions to foster a sense of meaning in life, well-being, and life satisfaction.

We present an overview of the main features of the Rasch analysis, using as an example the latent variable of depressive symptoms, with illustrations using the Beck Depression Inventory. We will show that with fitting data to the Rasch model, we can confirm the structural validity of the scale, including key attributes such as invariance, local dependency and unidimensionality. We also illustrate how the approach can inform on the meaning of the numbers attributed to scales, the amount of the latent traits that such numbers represent, and the consequent adequacy of statistical operations used to analyse them. We would argue that fitting data to the Rasch model has become the measurement standard for patient reported outcomes in general and, as a consequence will facilitate a quality improvement of outcome instruments in psychiatry. Recent advances in measurement technologies built upon the calibration of items derived from Rasch analysis in the form of computerized adaptive tests (CAT) open up further opportunities for reducing the burden of testing, and/or expanding the range of information that can be collected during a single session."}, {"Title": "The prevalence and clinical associations of mood instability in adults living in England: results from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2007.", "Abstract": "Mood instability is underinvestigated but potentially clinically important. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of mood instability in adults living in England and test whether it is important in explaining the extent of symptoms of common mental disorders, suicidality and healthcare use. An analysis of data from the adult psychiatric morbidity survey 2007, a household survey of private households in England (N=7403), was completed. The prevalence of mood instability was 13.9%. In univariate analysis it was strongly associated with socio-demographic and clinical variables. In regression modelling mood instability was independently associated with non-psychotic psychopathology, increasing the odds by 9.89. It was also linked with suicidal ideas (odds ratios (OR): 2.04) but not suicidal acts, and associated with being in receipt of medication, counselling or therapy for mental health problems (OR: 1.88), independent of a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. Mood instability is relatively common in the adult population, occurs frequently in common mental disorders and appears to be an important symptom in its own right. It is associated with two important measures in psychiatry, namely suicidal thinking and healthcare service use. It warrants more widespread recognition and further research is required to understand if, when and how to intervene."}, {"Title": "A spiritual problem?

For example, methodologically rigorous meta-analyses have recently found only modest overall effect sizes of CBT treatment, and therefore questions have emerged about forwhat and for whom it actually works.\nThe focus of the present paper is to elucidate the theoretical assumptions underlying CBT for schizophrenia and to examine their consistency with abnormalities of experience and self-awareness frequently reported by schizophrenia patients and systematically studied in phenomenological psychopathology from the beginning of the 20th century.\nWe argue that a strong theoretical emphasis on cognitive appraisals with only subsidiary attention devoted to affective and behavioral processes - as is characteristic of many forms of CBT - cannot satisfactorily account for the complex subjective experiences of schizophrenia patients. We further argue that certain theoretical strategies widely employed in CBT to explore and explain mental disorders, which involve atomization and, at times, a reification of mental phenomena, can be problematic and may result in a loss of explanatory potential. Finally, we provide a detailed account of how negative symptoms and delusions are conceptualized in CBT and consider the question of how these concepts fit the actual phenomenology of schizophrenia.\nWe suggest that further advancement of CBT theory and practice can benefit from a dialogue with phenomenological psychiatry in the search for effective psychotherapeutic strategies for schizophrenia patients."}, {"Title": "Lamotrigine in epilepsy, pregnancy and psychiatry--a drug for all seasons?", "Abstract": "Lamotrigine has been demonstrated to be effective as both an antiepileptic drug and a mood stabiliser.

Following the initial criteria developed by Petersen et al. in 1999, which focused on memory deficit in the context of otherwise normal cognition and general functioning, the concept has evolved with the introduction of subtypes of MCI and improved understanding of etiology. Our aim was to investigate current practice as well as familiarity with and attitudes toward the concept of MCI amongst UK old age psychiatrists.\nWe sent an anonymized postal survey to all clinicians on the Royal College of Psychiatrists Old Age Psychiatry register. Questions covered attitudes toward the concept of MCI in addition to diagnostic criteria and assessment tools used.\nThe response rate was 39% (453 of 1,154 questionnaires returned completed). The majority of respondents were consultants (83%) and 91% diagnosed MCI. Only 4.4% of the respondents thought that the concept of MCI was not useful and 79% of them required a memory complaint from either the patient or an informant for a diagnosis, but the majority did not have a specific cut-off on cognitive testing. Eighty-two percent reported that they required no or minimal impairment in activities of daily living for a diagnosis of MCI. The two most frequently used tools for assessment were the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised.\nOur survey shows that in the United Kingdom, the term MCI has become part of everyday clinical practice in psychiatry, suggesting that clinicians find it a useful term to conceptualize the transitional stage between normal aging and dementia.

Disturbances of motor activity were almost invariably present in patients with delirium and at a much higher frequency than in nondelirious control subjects. Principal components analysis identified 5-factors for the DMC where Factor 1 explained 37.3% of the variance and correlated significantly with DRS-R98 motor items. Items loading at >0.65 were selected for the replication scale if they also either correlated significantly with DRS-R98 motor items or were significantly more frequent in delirious patients vs. controls. The resultant scale comprised 12 items (five hyperactive and seven hypoactive) and was similar to the original DMSS.

This was a preliminary evaluation utilizing a recently-developed tool, the Clinical Supervision Evaluation Questionnaire, along with externally-facilitated focus groups. Nurses and midwives responded favourably to RPG, reporting a positive impact on clinical practice, self-awareness, and resilience. The majority of participants considered RPG had positive implications for team functioning. The focus groups identified the importance of facilitation style and the need to address aspects of workplace culture to enable group development and enhance the capacity for reflection.

For these (and other) reasons, increasing numbers of psychiatrists are turning to genotyping for help in selecting the psychopharmacologic agents best suited to an individual patient's distinctive metabolic characteristics and clinical presentation. Fortunately, routine genotyping is already available for gene variations that code for proteins involved in neurotransmission, and for drug-metabolizing enzymes involved in the elimination of many medications. Thus, genotyping-based personalized psychiatry is now in sight. Increasing numbers of clinically useful DNA microarrays are in the development stage, including a simplified procedure for genotyping patients for CYP2D6, which metabolizes a high proportion of the currently prescribed antidepressants and antipsychotics. It has been pointed out that psychiatric disease is rarely a consequence of an abnormality in a single gene, but reflects the perturbations of complex intracellular networks in the brain. Thus, analysis of functional neuronal networks is becoming an essential component of drug development strategies. The integrated use of technologies such as electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), in combination with pharmacogenetics, promises to transform our understanding of the mechanisms of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. The concept of network medicine envisions a time to come when drugs will be used to target a neural network rather than simply components within the network.

Yet the language of science and faith in the universal applicability of particular scientific methods to the craft of mental health care has come to permeate mental health practice communities. In this paper, the argument that many beliefs held by mental health professionals might be considered to be based on faith rather than science is presented, and the view that culture provides a useful lens for understanding mental health services and these paradoxes is proposed. Clearly there is a grand mental health narrative or colonizing influence of biological psychiatry that in various ways affects all mainstream mental health services. Local health services and professional communities might be considered subcultures. Understanding how mental health professions and practice are embedded in culture might be useful in considering how practice changes and why. Culture and caring practices are mutually embedded in localized subcultures. Therefore, a rich description of context and history is necessary in publication, presentation, or other communications to enable genuine understanding by a global audience. Viewing mental health practice in a cultural context highlights the importance of values and differences, and encourages humility in the face of ambiguity."}, {"Title": "Reflective practice groups for nurses: a consultation liaison psychiatry nursing initiative: part 1--The model.", "Abstract": "In the present study, we outline the evolution of a process-focused reflective practice group (RPG) model for nurses working in clinical settings.

The literature review identifies the key themes and theories on which the model is based, and the article outlines the process and practicalities of facilitating RPG in critical care, midwifery, and oncology specialties over a 3-year period. The model proposes that the effectiveness and sustainability of RPG arises from adequate preparation and engagement with prospective participants. Group rules, based on principles of confidentially, supportiveness, and diversity, were collaboratively developed for each group. Facilitation utilized a group-as-a-whole approach to manage process and stimulate reflection. While the purpose of RPG was a reflection on interpersonal aspects of nursing, contextual workplace issues were frequently raised in groups. Acknowledgement and containment of such issues were necessary to maintain clinical focus. The literature highlights facilitator credibility and style as crucial factors in the overall success of RPG, and it is proposed that reflective practice as a process-focused model for groups succeeds when nurse facilitators are trained in group process and receive concurrent supervision."}, {"Title": "The psychiatric interview: validity, structure, and subjectivity.", "Abstract": "There is a glaring gap in the psychiatric literature concerning the nature of psychiatric symptoms and signs, and a corresponding lack of epistemological discussion of psycho-diagnostic interviewing. Contemporary clinical neuroscience heavily relies on the use of fully structured interviews that are historically rooted in logical positivism and behaviorism. These theoretical approaches marked decisively the so-called \"operational revolution in psychiatry\" leading to the creation of DSM-III. This paper attempts to examine the theoretical assumptions that underlie the use of a fully structured psychiatric interview. We address the ontological status of pathological experience, the notions of symptom, sign, prototype and Gestalt, and the necessary second-person processes which are involved in converting the patient's experience (originally lived in the first-person perspective) into an \"objective\" (third person), actionable format, used for classification, treatment, and research. Our central thesis is that psychiatry targets the phenomena of consciousness, which, unlike somatic symptoms and signs, cannot be grasped on the analogy with material thing-like objects. We claim that in order to perform faithful distinctions in this particular domain, we need a more adequate approach, that is, an approach that is guided by phenomenologically informed considerations. Our theoretical discussion draws upon clinical examples derived from structured and semi-structured interviews. We conclude that fully structured interview is neither theoretically adequate nor practically valid in obtaining psycho-diagnostic information. Failure to address these basic issues may have contributed to the current state of malaise in the study of psychopathology."}, {"Title": "Motivational interviewing to reduce hazardous drinking and drug use among depression patients.", "Abstract": "This randomized study examined the efficacy of motivational interviewing (MI) to reduce substance use among adults with depression in outpatient psychiatry.

These drugs are effective and essential for the treatment of many psychiatric disorders and symptoms. Therapeutic outcomes, however, are still far from satisfactory for many patients. One major reason underlying insufficient response or problems of tolerability or toxicity is considerable interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetic properties of the patients. At the exact same dose, a more than 20-fold interindividual variation in steady state concentrations of the drugs in the body may result. Patients differ in their ability to absorb, distribute, metabolize and excrete drugs due to concurrent disease, age, concomitant medication or genetic peculiarities. A valuable tool for tailoring the dosage of the prescribed medication(s) to the individual characteristics of a patient is therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). For a considerable number of psychopharmacologic compounds, TDM has become a clinical routine for dose adjustment. The benefits of TDM regarding optimization of psychopharmacotherapy can be further enhanced by genotyping of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP). These enzymes are highly polymorphic and involved in the metabolism of most psychotherapeutic drugs. Genotyping related information may be supportive especially for drugs that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2C19 or CYP2D6. The in vivo activity of CYP isoenzymes can be determined using probe drug assays. When used appropriately, phenotyping and genotyping methods are most helpful for problem solving and improvement of the outcomes of psychopharmacotherapy for many patients."}, {"Title": "Teaching evidence-based approaches to suicide risk assessment and prevention that enhance psychiatric training.", "Abstract": "This report describes one in a series of National Institute of Health (NIH) supported conferences aimed at enhancing the ability of leaders of psychiatry residency training to teach research literacy and produce both clinician-scholars and physician-scientists in their home programs.

This has led to the commercialization of genetic tests across a wide range of medical disorders. Public interest in one's own future health and an increasing desire for autonomy over one's health care have facilitated a large and growing market for such genetic tests to be sold direct to the consumer (DTC). Amidst a plethora of tests for a broad range of medical conditions, DTC genetic tests currently include a number of tests related to risk for various psychiatric illnesses including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder and also for prediction of individual response to psychotropic medication. Although a large number of studies show that there is strong public interest in genetic susceptibility testing for psychiatric disorders, little is known about the impact on individuals of receiving the results of genetic tests. Moreover, the low predictive power and uncertain clinical validity and utility of DTC genetic tests for psychiatric disorders have led to both controversy and difficulties of interpretation of results. This review summarizes the rationale for using genetic risk tests in psychiatry, as an intervention for protective cognitive and behavioral change, and to predict medication response, with a focus on MDD. Since genetic risk information has the potential to influence major life-changing health decisions, there is an imperative to ensure that there is an appropriate evidence base to support the use of such genetic tests."}, {"Title": "Anterior insular cortex mediates bodily sensibility and social anxiety.", "Abstract": "Studies in psychiatry and cognitive neuroscience have reported an important relationship between individual interoceptive accuracy and anxiety level. This indicates that greater attention to one's bodily state may contribute to the development of intense negative emotions and anxiety disorders. We hypothesized that reactivity in the anterior insular cortex underlies the intensity of interoceptive awareness and anxiety. To elucidate this triadic mechanism, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and mediation analyses to examine the relationship between emotional disposition and activation in the anterior insular cortex while participants evaluated their own emotional and bodily states. Our results indicated that right anterior insular activation was positively correlated with individual levels of social anxiety and neuroticism and negatively correlated with agreeableness and extraversion. The results of the mediation analyses revealed that activity in the right anterior insula mediated the activity of neural correlates of interoceptive sensibility and social fear. Our findings suggest that attention to interoceptive sensation affects personality traits through how we feel emotion subjectively in various situations."}, {"Title": "Victims of bullying in the emergency department with behavioral issues.", "Abstract": "Bullying has become one of the most significant school problems experienced by our children.

The aim of this study is to analyze the worldwide scientific production in the area of alcohol-drinking and alcohol-related problems from 2005 to 2009.\nA MEDLINE and Scopus search on alcohol (alcohol-drinking and alcohol-related problems) published from 2005 to 2009 was carried out. Using bibliometric indicators, the distribution of the publications was determined within the journals that publish said articles, specialty of the journal (broad subject terms), article type, language of the publication, and country where the journal is published. Also, authorship characteristics were assessed (collaboration index and number of authors who have published more than 9 documents). The existing research groups were also determined.\nAbout 24,100 documents on alcohol, published in 3,862 journals, and authored by 69,640 authors were retrieved from MEDLINE and Scopus between the years 2005 and 2009. The collaboration index of the articles was 4.83 \u00b1 3.7. The number of consolidated research groups in the field was identified as 383, with 1,933 authors.

Many of these patients seem to have a psychological 'core' to their illness that affects the way they experience, conceptualise and communicate their distress. There is considerable debate around diagnosis for this group of patients. Existing diagnoses include somatoform disorders in psychiatry and functional disorders in the medical specialties. Some clinicians use the term 'heartsink' patients, which reflects the interpersonal frustration inherent in some therapeutic relationships. A good diagnosis should be clinically useful, helping clinicians and patients understand and manage illness. Diagnosis should also provide a reliable classification for research and evidence-based treatment. The allegory of the botanist and the gardener has been used to describe diagnosis. For the botanist, a good diagnosis produces a taxonomy that is rigorous and reliable. For the gardener, it informs the way a garden is described and understood in a specific context. Clinicians need both: a 'botanical' type of classification to bring rigour to research and therapy, and clinical 'gardening', which allows for multiple perspectives and diagnostic frameworks. Clinical reasoning is a form of research with therapeutic intent. Botany and gardening represent a mixed-methods approach that can enrich diagnosis. The challenge is to integrate multiple perspectives in clinically helpful ways that help us retain both richness and rigour."}, {"Title": "Thalamocortical disconnection in the orbitofrontal region associated with cortical thinning in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Dysfunction of the thalamocortical pathway has been proposed as a putative underlying pathology of schizophrenia.

Group differences in mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values were examined in the entire thalamocortical pathway, the thalamolateral prefrontal pathway, the thalamomedial prefrontal pathway, and the thalamo-orbitofrontal pathway. Surface-based analysis was performed to investigate cortical thickness, and the correlation between FA values and cortical thickness was examined.\nThe patient group exhibited reduced FA values within the right thalamo-orbitofrontal pathway (P < .05 for the 8 group comparisons of FA, Bonferroni correction). In the patient group only, the mean FA value for this pathway was positively correlated with thickness of the right frontal polar and lateral orbitofrontal cortices (P < .05, clusterwise correction).\nThese results suggest that, in schizophrenia, regional thalamocortical white matter pathology is specifically associated with cortical pathology in regions where fibers connect."}, {"Title": "The cumulative load of depressive illness is associated with cognitive function in the remitted state of unipolar depressive disorder.", "Abstract": "To investigate whether the cumulative number, duration and subtypes (severity and presence of psychotic features) of previous episodes of depression in patients with unipolar depressive disorder in a remitted state are associated with decreased global cognitive function.\nVia the Danish registers individuals between 40 and 80 years of age were identified: (1) patients with a diagnosis of unipolar disorder at their first discharge from a psychiatric hospital in the period 1994 to 2002, and (2) gender and age matched control individuals. The participants were assessed with the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG), which provides a composite measure of global cognitive function.\nA total of 88 patients and 50 controls accepted our invitation to participate, fulfilled the selection criteria and were included in the study.

The aim of this study was to find differences in the steroid spectrum in patients and controls, and to assess the diagnosis of schizophrenia by building a predictive model based on steroid data. Thirty-nine serum steroids (22 neuroactive steroids and their metabolites and 17 polar conjugates) representing steroid metabolome were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 22 drug-naive (first episode) schizophrenia patients (13 men and 9 women) before and after six-month treatment with atypical antipsychotics. The results were compared to the data from healthy subjects (22 males, 25 females). In summary the following significant differences were found: (1) In both sexes higher levels of pregnenolone sulfate and sulfated 5\u03b1- as well as 5\u03b2-saturated metabolites of C21-steroids in progesterone metabolic pathway were found in patients, pointing to decreased activity of sulfatase. (2) In a few instances decreased levels of the respective 5\u03b1-metabolites of C21 steroids were found in patients. (3) As C19 steroids concern, in both sexes there were considerably lowered levels of 5\u03b2-reduced metabolites in patients. On the other hand, with only a few exceptions, the treatment did not significantly influence most steroid levels. Further, to assess the relationships between schizophrenia status and steroid levels and to build the predictive model of schizophrenia, multivariate regression with reduction of dimensionality (the method of orthogonal projections to latent structures, OPLS) was applied. Irrespective of the small number of patients, use of this model enabled us to state the diagnosis of schizophrenia with almost 100% sensitivity. Our findings suggest that the assessment of steroid levels may become a valid and accurate laboratory test in psychiatry. A limitation of our study is the absence of subjects with a diagnosis other than schizophrenia, so we cannot conclude whether the results are specific for schizophrenia. On the other hand, steroid metabolome model may be used as a diagnostic tool for further studies."}, {"Title": "An examination of adults on antipsychotic medication at risk for metabolic syndrome: a comparison with obese and eating disorder populations.", "Abstract": "Little research has explored how eating disorders (ED) may be involved in the increased risk for metabolic syndrome in adults on antipsychotic medication.

Drawing on a study that involved over 150 families in the USA and the UK, I show that children are able to report threats to authenticity, but that the majority of children are not concerned with such threats. On balance, children report that stimulants improve their capacity for moral agency, and they associate this capacity with an ability to meet normative expectations. I argue that although under certain conditions stimulant drug treatment may increase the risk of a threat to authenticity, there are ways to minimise this risk and to maximise the benefits of stimulant drug treatment. Medical professionals in particular should help children to flourish with stimulant drug treatments, in good and in bad conditions."}, {"Title": "Predictive classification of individual magnetic resonance imaging scans from children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "Neuroimaging techniques are increasingly being explored as potential tools for clinical prediction in psychiatry. There are a wide range of approaches which can be applied to make individual predictions for various aspects of disorders such as diagnostic status, symptom severity scores, identification of patients at risk of developing disorders and estimation of the likelihood of response to treatment. This selective review highlights a popular group of pattern recognition techniques, support vector machines (SVMs) for use with structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. First, however, we outline various practical issues, limitations and techniques which need to be considered before SVM's can be applied. We begin with a discussion on the practicalities of scanning children and adolescent participants and the importance of acquiring high quality images. Scan processing required for inter-subject comparisons is then discussed. We then briefly discuss feature selection and other considerations when applying pattern recognition techniques. Finally, SVMs are described and various studies highlighted to indicate the potential of these techniques for child and adolescent psychiatric research."}, {"Title": "A new diagnostic approach for Turkish speaking populations DAWBA Turkish Version.", "Abstract": "Aims. Turkey has the youngest population in Europe with about 25 million people aged below 19 years and Turkish-speaking people comprise the biggest migrant group in Europe with 2.5 million people dispersed in different countries, but conducting epidemiologic surveys on Turkish people is challenging due to the lack of a suitable diagnostic tool. The Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) is one of the most widely used diagnostic interviews in child and adolescent psychiatry. In this study, we aimed at translating the DAWBA into Turkish and then examined its validity and reliability. Methods. The validity of the Turkish version was examined in clinical (n\u00a0=\u00a050) and community (n\u00a0=\u00a0104) samples. The interrater reliability was also evaluated on 20 cases. Results. The translation method used in the study achieved semantic, conceptual, content, technical, item and criterion equivalence between the Turkish and original forms. The validity of the Turkish DAWBA was good or excellent for different diagnostic categories (\u03ba: 0.43-0.84); the interrater reliability was also excellent (\u03ba: 0.85-1). Conclusions. The Turkish DAWBA may be useful for future prevalence studies in Turkey.

The nurses generally assessed the decision-making competency of the patient correctly. However, their decisions regarding whether the patient should be compulsorily hospitalized and their understanding of their duty to warn/protect were less consistent.

Diagnosis of depression has traditionally been made based on clinical criteria, including patient current symptoms and history. This process is widely used but relies on subjective interpretation. To standardize both the data obtained and data interpretation, various interview-based instruments and noninterview methods exist for screening and testing for depression in various clinical settings. This article evaluates the technical basis for and clinical performance of these various instruments and methods to diagnosis depression in clinical settings. Traditional tools include physician-administered or patient self-administered interview tools that have reasonable clinical accuracy depending on the threshold score and may lead to a full diagnostic evaluation for high-risk patients. In addition, older laboratory methods such as the dexamethasone test have contributed to the diagnosis of depression over a long period. Newer diagnostic methods such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics are technically sophisticated and objective and are beginning to emerge in psychiatry. Although promising, further evaluation of these methods is needed to fully demonstrate their clinical value and accuracy."}, {"Title": "Who cares for it?

With the goal of (re-)introducing his work to an anglophonic audience, we review and provide an historical context for RKE's etiologic theory of major psychiatric illness. RKE saw psychiatric disorders as multifactorial, arising from two sets of etiologic factors: predisposing and exciting. Exciting causes were either psychological or physical, while predisposing causes were either general (e.g. sex, occupation, age) or individual-specific. Three major individual-specific risk factors were of particular importance: heredity, personality and education/rearing. Hereditary factors were typically the most important but were usually non-specific in their effect with the forms of psychiatric illness often differing in close relatives. He emphasized the importance of the 'neuropathic personality,' which rendered affected individuals sensitive to the pathogenic effects of various exciting influences. Poor rearing could also substantially increase risk for major mental illness. RKE saw the influences of hereditary and rearing factors on psychiatric illness as often mediated through a neuropathic personality. While RKE believed in degeneration theory and emphasized the potential etiologic importance of masturbation in psychiatric illness, his clinical writings were otherwise characterized by a broad-minded and sensible approach that lacked the narrowness of the strongly brain-based or psychoanalytic psychiatric schools which were very influential during and shortly after his life."}, {"Title": "Psycho-education and group cognitive-behavioural therapy for clinical perfectionism: a case-series evaluation.", "Abstract": "Research indicates that psycho-education and cognitive behavioural interventions can reduce perfectionism but to date no group treatments have been examined.\nThe current study utilized a case series design to compare psycho-education materials and subsequent eight-week group cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) to a baseline waitlist in an outpatient community psychiatry sample (n = 21).\nParticipants were assessed on five occasions: baseline, 4 weeks later (waitlist), 4 weeks after receiving psycho-education material, post-treatment (8 weeks after receiving the group intervention), and 3-month follow-up.\nThere was a main effect of time for perfectionism and negative affect from baseline to post-group (effect sizes ranging from 1.46 to 1.91) that were maintained at 3-month follow-up.\nThese results suggested that group CBT for clinical perfectionism may be beneficial, but that psycho-education alone is not effective for reducing perfectionism or negative affect."}, {"Title": "Axis I and II comorbidity and psychosocial functioning in female adolescents with borderline personality disorder.", "Abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is known to be associated with high rates of comorbidity and severe impairment of psychosocial functioning in adults.

Axis I and Axis II diagnoses were assessed by experienced clinicians using well-established semistructured interviews, along with psychosocial functioning.\nThe final sample (87 participants) comprised 31 participants with a diagnosis of BPD and 56 participants with mixed psychiatric diagnoses. The most common comorbid disorders in the adolescent BPD sample were mood, eating, dissociative, and substance use disorders in Axis I, and cluster C personality disorders in Axis II. The BPD group showed a significantly higher average number of comorbid Axis I and Axis II diagnoses and significantly lower psychosocial functioning compared with the clinical control group. Regression analyses revealed that psychosocial functioning was predicted by socioeconomic status and comorbid disorders, as well as the unique influence of BPD itself.\nAdolescent BPD in females is accompanied by high rates of psychiatric comorbidity and poor psychosocial functioning.

In this paper, we will discuss recent perspectives on disordered intersubjectivity among the core symptoms of schizophrenic psychoses. Based on symptoms crucial for communication deficits in schizophrenia, we address indeterminacy of translation as a potential default in the therapeutic setting. The concept of indeterminacy of translation reviewed here assumes that no reference for translation of languages is given, but principles to substitute this non-referring space of unknown terms are to be demonstrated: firstly, a maxim of indulgence which requires that as many true considerations as possible have to be achieved by the final interpretation of a proposition, and secondly, a coherence which is given when the considerations are deductable and not contradictory. Indulgence and coherence are hypothesized as reflecting an approximation process of reconstructing intersubjectivity in conditions where it is severely disturbed such as schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Postpartum depression: the (in) experience of Brazilian primary healthcare professionals.", "Abstract": "This article reports experiences of Brazilian physicians and nurses caring for women with postpartum depression in primary healthcare settings.\nPrevalence of postpartum depression in Brazil ranges from 12-37%, which fits with international claims about differences in the magnitude of the problem and consistency of screening.\nQualitative descriptive.\nThis study was situated in health units of the Family Health Strategy in Campina Grande, Brazil. Data were collected from September 2010-January 2011 through open-ended interviews with ten nurses and seven physicians, observations, and field diary records. Inductive content analysis was used to develop categories.\nThree categories: (1) Limited professional exposure to postpartum depression; (2) Postpartum depression as the domain of psychiatry; and (3) Challenges dealing with postpartum depression demonstrated that few professionals felt postpartum depression merited their attention. Women, with signs of postpartum depression, were usually identified by family members who noticed behaviours that seemed abnormal. Care providers indicated they had inadequate time and access to screening techniques to identify women with depression attending unit-based pregnancy and postpartum groups. When identified, women were referred directly to psychiatric care.\nWithout consistent screening and diagnostic techniques, Brazilian health professionals are insecure about identifying and treating cases of postpartum depression. Referring women to psychiatric units entail more time for women to be diagnosed and treated and increased costs for health services. Primary healthcare professionals require training to screen, identify, and treat postpartum depression in primary healthcare settings."}, {"Title": "Facial trauma patients with a preexisting psychiatric illness: a 5-year study.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify and assess the demographics and presence of preexisting psychiatric disorders in an adult patient cohort admitted for the management of a facial injury.\nThe analysis included demographics, type of facial injury, length of hospital stay, and psychiatric diagnosis according to criteria as set out in the DSM-IV-TR-2000.\nWe identified 71 patients who had confirmed psychiatric comorbidity.

Data were collected from 3079 registered nurses in 60 acute hospitals in South Korea by a stratified random sampling method based on the region and number of beds.\nThe dependent variable was the occurrence of needlestick or sharp injuries in the last year, and the independent variables were protective equipment, nurse characteristics, and hospital characteristics. This study employed logistic regression analysis with generalized estimating equation clustering by hospital to identify the factors associated with needlestick or sharp injuries.\nThe majority (70.4%) of the hospital nurses had experienced needlestick or sharp injuries in the previous year. The non-use of safety containers for disposal of sharps and needles, less working experience as a registered nurse, poor work environments in regards to staffing and resource adequacy, and high emotional exhaustion significantly increased risk for needlestick or sharp injuries. Working in perioperative units also significantly increased the risk for such injuries but working in intensive care units, psychiatry, and obstetrics wards showed a significantly lower risk than medical-surgical wards.\nThe occurrence of needlestick or sharp injuries of registered nurses was associated with organizational characteristics as well as protective equipment and nurse characteristics. Hospitals can prevent or reduce such injuries by establishing better work environments in terms of staffing and resource adequacy, minimizing emotional exhaustion, and retaining more experienced nurses. All hospitals should make safety-engineered equipment available to registered nurses. Hospitals as well as specific units showing higher risk for needlestick and sharp injuries should implement organizational strategies to prevent such injuries. It is also necessary to establish a monitoring system of needlestick and sharp injuries at a hospital level and a reporting system at the national level in South Korea."}, {"Title": "Can postdischarge follow-up contacts prevent suicide and suicidal behavior?

However, there has been increasing recognition in the general medical literature that such sequelae might encompass more pervasive alterations in health status and physiology. Recent findings in telomere biology have suggested a new avenue for exploring the adverse health effects of childhood maltreatment. Telomere length in proliferative tissues declines with cell replication and the effect can be accelerated by such factors as inflammation, oxidative stress, radiation, and toxins. Reduced telomere length, as a proxy for cellular aging, has been associated with numerous chronic somatic diseases that are generally considered to be diseases of aging, such as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. More recently, shorter telomeres have been demonstrated in several psychiatric conditions, particularly depression. Sustained psychosocial stress of a variety of types in adulthood appears to be associated with shorter telomeres. Now, emerging work suggests a robust, and perhaps dose-dependent, relationship with early-life stress. These findings present new opportunities to reconceptualize the complex relationships between experience, physical and psychiatric disease, and aging."}, {"Title": "Prevalence of psychotropic drug use in adults with intellectual disability: positive and negative findings from a large scale study.", "Abstract": "The use of psychotropics by categories and the reason for their prescription was investigated in a large scale study of 4,069 adults with ID, including those with autism spectrum disorder, in New York State. Similar to other studies it was found that 58 % (2,361/4,069) received one or more psychotropics. Six percent received typical, while 39 % received atypical antipsychotics [corrected]. There was greater use of antidepressants (23 %), mood stabilizers (19 %), and antianxiety agents (16 %) relative to other studies. The use of anti-impulsives, stimulants and hypnotics was rare (1-2 %). Half of the psychotropics were prescribed for treatment of major psychiatric disorders, 13 % for control of challenging behaviors, and 38 % for both. Results indicated that the major psychiatric disorders, except anxiety disorder and autism, influenced the use of psychotropics and the number of medication used. These findings imply that although practitioners still rely too heavily on the use of antipsychotics in this population, there is a welcome shift in the prescription patterns relative to other studies. The practitioners appeared to use psychotropics primarily to treat diagnosed psychiatric disorders and not just to control aggressive behavior which suggests that evidence-based practice of psychiatry is playing an increasing role in the ID population."}, {"Title": "Histone regulation in the CNS: basic principles of epigenetic plasticity.", "Abstract": "Postmitotic neurons are subject to a vast array of environmental influences that require the nuclear integration of intracellular signaling events to promote a wide variety of neuroplastic states associated with synaptic function, circuit formation, and behavioral memory.

It was supplemented by a manual search of the literature. Choice of items was based on their established or potential incremental increase in clinical information compared with use of standard diagnostic criteria. The most representative examples were selected.\nResearch on clinical judgment has disclosed several innovative assessment strategies: the use of diagnostic transfer stations instead of diagnostic endpoints using repeated assessments, subtyping versus integration of different diagnostic categories, staging, macro-analysis, extension of clinical information beyond symptomatic features. Evidence-based medicine does not appear to provide an adequate scientific background for challenges of clinical practice in psychiatry and needs to be integrated with clinical judgment. CONCLUSIONS. A renewed interest in clinical judgment may yield substantial advances in clinical assessment and treatment. A different clinical psychiatry is available and can be practiced now."}, {"Title": "Cyber-support: an analysis of online self-help forums (online self-help forums in bipolar disorder).", "Abstract": "The Internet is becoming increasingly important in psychiatry and psychotherapy.\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate if and how online self-help forums are used by patients with bipolar disorders, their relatives and treating professionals.\nA total of 2400 postings in two online forums were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively.\n\"Disclosure\", \"friendship\" and \"online-group cohesion\" were the main self-help mechanisms. The topics most discussed were \"social network\", \"symptoms of the illness\" and \"medication\". Factor analyses revealed three factors concerning self-help mechanisms: \"group cohesion\", \"emotional support\" and \"exchange of information\", as well as three factors concerning fields of interest: \"illness-related aspects\", \"social aspects\" and \"financial and legal issues\".\nWe infer that the main interest in participating in online forums for patients with bipolar disorders and their relatives is to share emotions and to discuss their daily struggles with the illness. Our study also reveals that social networking is very important for patients coping with bipolar disorders.

It also reports sensitivity, specificity, and agreement for ADHD diagnosis.\nA clinical sample of 246 children and adolescents were interviewed face to face using both ADHD diagnostic criteria for DSM-V and DSM-IV by interviewing clinician. Comorbid psychiatric disorders were screened using DSM-IV criteria.\nThe rate of ADHD diagnosis using DSM-V was significantly higher than the rate detected by using DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. The sensitivity of DSM-V diagnostic criteria was 100%, while its specificity was 71.1%. The kappa agreement between DSM-IV and DSM-V was 0.75. In addition, positive predictive value was 85.1%. All the four newly added symptoms to ADHD diagnostic criteria are statistically more common in the children with ADHD than those in the comparison group. However, these symptoms are also very common in the children without ADHD.\nIt is expected that the rate of ADHD would increase using the proposed ADHD DSM-V criteria.

Written records or other documents that could identify this psychopathology are extremely rare and must therefore be subjected to meticulous historical and psychopathologic analysis.\nA previously unknown heraldic sheet, with accompanying text, was subjected to historical, heraldic, and psychopathologic analysis. The contemporary inscription \"by the mad paynter Bayer\" was found on the back of the painting. The phenomenologic analysis emphasized the phenomenology of Jaspers for the formal criteria of a psychosis.\nMany of the characteristics as seen typical psychopathologic of presumably schizophrenic psychoses by some authors can be found in the formal features of the work. Moreover, a precise historic and heraldic investigation (blazon) allowed us to assign this previously anonymous work to an artist of the period around 1720 to 1740, Abraham Beurer, and to find his contemporary portrait.\nThis is one of the earliest works that can be unambiguously assigned to the psychopathology of expression (art brut). The formal features of schizophrenia appear to be remarkably typical, timeless, and stable, although the objective features are strictly historical. The work provides further evidence that there were individual cases of schizophrenia even before the 18th century. The external designation as \"mad\" provides important additional support for this view."}, {"Title": "Risk factors for psychological distress in Northern Ireland.", "Abstract": "Stress-related mental ill health and its disorders are considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be the new world epidemic and their prevalence rates seem to be increasing worldwide.\nTo examine and identify sub-populations at risk for psychological discomfort in Northern Ireland and map the relative impact of potential predictors.\nA sample of 4,638 respondents to the NIHSW-2001 survey was analysed with latent class analysis and latent class factorial analysis. Latent class multinomial logistic regression assessed the impact of a range of predictors on class membership.\nFive sub-populations were differentiated. All subgroups at risk for anxiety and depression were characterized as being younger and female. Disability and adverse life events were strong predictors of risk. Long-standing illness and housing worries were predictors of medium and high risk membership. The effect of civil unrest was significant only for the medium-risk subgroup; marital status and income did not affect group membership.\nBecause all five subgroups showed a different probability, but a similar profile of endorsing GHQ-12 items, it could be hypothesized that an underlying continuum dimension of anxiety and depression is present in the Northern Irish population."}, {"Title": "Staff's perception of adolescent aggressive behaviour in four European forensic units: a qualitative interview study.", "Abstract": "Aggressive behaviour among patients is extremely common in forensic adolescent psychiatry compromising the safety of the treatment milieu and posing a treatment challenge to the staff. The staff's perception of aggression is likely to contribute to the aggression management practices among disturbed adolescents.\nTo examine staff's perceptions of adolescent aggressive behaviour and factors contributing it.\nQualitative interviews were conducted in four adolescent forensic units in four European countries. Data was analysed using qualitative content analysis.\nAggressive behaviour was perceived to be verbal and physical in nature with various levels of severity. Several factors were perceived to contribute to aggressive acts, including adolescents' early life experiences. Participants mainly shared perceptions of adolescent aggressive behaviour in the four units studied.\nThe study provides new international knowledge about how staff perceive adolescent aggressive behaviour in the forensic setting. The shared understanding of adolescents' aggressive behaviour enables the implementation of safe, ethically sound and more consistent aggression management in clinical forensic practice.

The official restraint reports and the hospital files of the restraint patients from January 2009 to December 2009 were collected and analyzed.\nAmong adolescents hospitalized in closed wards, the 1-year prevalence of mechanical restraint was 9.5%. Among all hospitalized adolescents, the prevalence was 6.9%. The number of mechanically restrained individuals per 100,000 13 to 17-year -old Finnish-speaking inhabitants was 57.1. The median duration of the restraint episode was 4 h and 50 min, but almost half of the mechanical restraint episodes lasted 8 h or more. A quarter of restraint episodes were not based on reasons mentioned in the Finnish Mental Health Act. The most frequent diagnostic categories of mechanically restrained adolescents were mood disorders followed by schizophrenia-related as well as behavioral and emotional disorders. Suicidality preceded 40% and violence 61% of restraint episodes. Boys were restrained during the first days of hospital treatment significantly more often than were girls, whereas one in four girls experienced her first episode of restraint after 1 month of hospitalization.\nReducing the number and shortening the length of mechanical restraint episodes requires education of staff as well as projects focusing on reducing coercion.

It is assumed that an imbalance between community and hospital care for chronic patients puts pressure on crisis services.\nIn this study, the central question is whether patients receiving long-term psychiatric care in Amsterdam do indeed put pressure on the city's emergency mental health services. We compare the pressure exerted by this group with the pressure resulting from the use of these services by all registered patients.\nData were taken from the client registration systems of three mental health organizations in Amsterdam in the period from 2000 to 2004. Inclusion criteria for long-term psychiatric patients were age above 19 years and uninterrupted receipt of mental health care for a minimum of two successive years.\nAnnually, 6%-8% of all non-long-term patients experienced a crisis outside office hours in the period under investigation; this was 4%-6% for long-term patients. The non-long-term patients accounted for 83% of crisis contacts outside office hours over the entire study period, with long-term patients accounting for 17%.\nThe assumption that crises are more prevalent in long-term patients in the community seems to be an example of stigmatization rather than an observation based on fact."}, {"Title": "Working around a contested diagnosis: borderline personality disorder in adolescence.", "Abstract": "This discourse analytic study sits at the intersection of everyday communications with young people in mental health settings and the enduring sociological critique of diagnoses in psychiatry. The diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) is both contested and stigmatized, in mental health and general health settings. Its legitimacy is further contested within the specialist adolescent mental health setting. In this setting, clinicians face a quandary regarding the application of adult diagnostic criteria to an adolescent population, aged less than 18 years. This article presents an analysis of interviews undertaken with Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) clinicians in two publicly funded Australian services, about their use of the BPD diagnosis. In contrast with notions of primacy of diagnosis or of transparency in communications, doctors, nurses and allied health clinicians resisted and subverted a diagnosis of BPD in their work with adolescents. We delineate specific social and discursive strategies that clinicians displayed and reflected on, including: team rules which discouraged diagnostic disclosure; the lexical strategy of hedging when using the diagnosis; the prohibition and utility of informal 'borderline talk' among clinicians; and reframing the diagnosis with young people. For clinicians, these strategies legitimated their scepticism and enabled them to work with diagnostic uncertainty, in a population identified as vulnerable. For adolescent identities, these strategies served to forestall a BPD trajectory, allowing room for troubled adolescents to move and grow. These findings illuminate how the contest surrounding this diagnosis in principle is expressed in everyday clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Chronic renal failure in lithium-using geriatric patients: effects of lithium continuation versus discontinuation--a 60-month retrospective study.", "Abstract": "Lithium remains an important treatment in bipolar disorder. Although lithium is often discontinued because of signs of renal failure, it is unclear if this alters the course of renal function in the majority of patients. We hypothesize that in geriatric patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), who have a high burden of medical illness, lithium continuation does not significantly impact renal function (glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)).\nWe conducted a retrospective study of tertiary-care geriatric psychiatry outpatients with a history of lithium use and evidence of CRF (eGFR \u2264 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 on \u2265 2 occasions in \u2265 3 months). The 27 patients who met these criteria were divided into lithium 'continuers' (continued use \u2265 2 years following CRF) and 'discontinuers'. Mean eGFR and creatinine were followed at 21 and 60 months after developing CRF.\nMean serum eGFR and creatinine were not significantly different between groups at any time during follow-up. When comparing renal function at 60 months to baseline, a trend towards increased creatinine was seen in continuers (p = 0.06) but not in discontinuers. Changes in eGFR in continuers and discontinuers after 60 months did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.35 and 0.98). However, clinically important decreases in eGFR occurred in the majority of continuers but in none of the discontinuers.\nThere was a trend towards declining renal function in lithium continuers at 60-month follow-up. Future prospective longitudinal studies will be needed to confirm our findings. We suggest vigilance and close monitoring of renal function when continuing CRF patients on lithium for extended periods."}, {"Title": "The neural network sustaining crossmodal integration is impaired in alcohol-dependence: an fMRI study.", "Abstract": "Crossmodality (i.e., the integration of stimulations coming from different sensory modalities) is a crucial ability in everyday life and has been extensively explored in healthy adults. Still, it has not yet received much attention in psychiatry, and particularly in alcohol-dependence. The present study investigates the cerebral correlates of crossmodal integration deficits in alcohol-dependence to assess whether these deficits are due to the mere accumulation of unimodal impairments or rather to specific alterations in crossmodal areas.\nTwenty-eight subjects [14 alcohol-dependent subjects (ADS), 14 paired controls] were scanned using fMRI while performing a categorization task on faces (F), voices (V) and face-voice pairs (FV). A subtraction contrast [FV-(F+V)] and a conjunction analysis [(FV-F) \u2229 (FV-V)] isolated the brain areas specifically involved in crossmodal face-voice integration. The functional connectivity between unimodal and crossmodal areas was explored using psycho-physiological interactions (PPI).\nADS presented only moderate alterations during unimodal processing. More centrally, in the subtraction contrast and conjunction analysis, they did not show any specific crossmodal brain activation while controls presented activations in specific crossmodal areas (inferior occipital gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule). Moreover, PPI analyses showed reduced connectivity between unimodal and crossmodal areas in alcohol-dependence.\nThis first fMRI exploration of crossmodal processing in alcohol-dependence showed a specific face-voice integration deficit indexed by reduced activation of crossmodal areas and reduced connectivity in the crossmodal integration network. Using crossmodal paradigms is thus crucial to correctly evaluate the deficits presented by ADS in real-life situations."}, {"Title": "Impact of psychiatrists' qualifications on the rate of compulsory admissions.", "Abstract": "Despite efforts to reduce coercion in psychiatry, involuntary hospitalizations remain frequent, representing more than half of all admissions in some European regions. Since October 2006, only certified psychiatrists are authorized to require a compulsory admission to our facility, while before all physicians were, including residents. The aim of the present study is to assess the impact of this change of procedure on the proportion compulsory admissions. All medical records of patients admitted respectively 4 months before and 4 month after the implementation of the procedure were retrospectively analyzed. This search retrieved a total of 2,227 hospitalizations for 1,584 patients. The overall proportions of compulsory and voluntary admissions were 63.9 % and 36.1 % respectively. The average length of stay was 32 days (SD \u00b1 64.4). During the study period, 25 % of patients experienced two hospitalizations or more. The most frequent patients' diagnoses were affective disorders (30 %), psychotic disorders (18.4 %) and substance abuse disorders (15.7 %). Compared with the period before October 2006, patients hospitalized from October 2006 up were less likely to be hospitalized on a compulsory basis (OR = 0.745, 95 % CI: 0.596-0.930). Factors associated with involuntary admission were young age (20 years or less), female gender, a diagnosis of psychotic disorder and being hospitalized for the first time. Our results strongly suggest that limiting the right to require compulsory admissions to fully certified psychiatrists can reduce the rate of compulsory versus voluntary admissions."}, {"Title": "Perspectives on Erving Goffman's \"Asylums\" fifty years on.", "Abstract": "Erving Goffman's \"Asylums\" is a key text in the development of contemporary, community-orientated mental health practice.

By explaining a large portion of variability in individual drug metabolism, pharmacogenetics offers a diagnostic tool in the burgeoning era of personalized medicine. This review updates existing evidence on the influence of pharmacogenetic variants on drug exposure and discusses the rationale for genetic testing in the clinical context. Dose adjustments based on pharmacogenetic knowledge are the first step to translate pharmacogenetics into clinical practice. However, also clinical factors, such as the consequences on toxicity and therapeutic failure, must be considered to provide clinical recommendations and assess the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenetic treatment strategies. DME polymorphisms are relevant not only for clinical pharmacology and practice but also for research in psychiatry and neuroscience. Several DMEs, above all the cytochrome P (CYP) enzymes, are expressed in the brain, where they may contribute to the local biochemical homeostasis. Of particular interest is the possibility of DMEs playing a physiological role through their action on endogenous substrates, which may underlie the reported associations between genetic polymorphisms and cognitive function, personality and vulnerability to mental disorders. Neuroimaging studies have recently presented evidence of an effect of the CYP2D6 polymorphism on basic brain function. This review summarizes evidence on the effect of DME polymorphisms on brain function that adds to the well-known effects of DME polymorphisms on pharmacokinetics in explaining the range of phenotypes that are relevant to psychiatric practice."}, {"Title": "Cortisol and depression: three questions for psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Cortisol plays a multifaceted role in major depression disorder (MDD). Diurnal rhythms are disturbed, there is increased resistance to the feedback action of glucocorticoids, excess cortisol may induce MDD, basal levels may be higher and the post-awakening cortisol surge accentuated in those at risk for MDD. Does this suggest new avenues for studying MDD or its clinical management?\nThe relevant literature was reviewed.\nCortisol contributes to genetic variants for the risk for MDD and the way that environmental events amplify risk. The corticoids' influence begins prenatally, but continues into adulthood. The impact of cortisol at each phase depends not only on its interaction with other factors, such as psychological traits and genetic variants, but also on events that have, or have not, occurred previously.\nThis review suggests that the time is now right for serious consideration of the role of cortisol in a clinical context. Estimates of cortisol levels and the shape of the diurnal rhythm might well guide the understanding of subtypes of MDD and yield additional indicators for optimal treatment. Patients with disturbed cortisol rhythms might benefit from restitution of those rhythms; they may be distinct from those with more generally elevated levels, who might benefit from cortisol blockade. Higher levels of cortisol are a risk for subsequent depression. Should manipulation of cortisol or its receptors be considered as a preventive measure for some of those at very high risk of future MDD, or to reduce other cortisol-related consequences such as long-term cognitive decline?"}, {"Title": "Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation as a treatment for psychiatric disorders: a comprehensive review.", "Abstract": "Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique of neuromodulation and neurostimulation based on the principle of electromagnetic induction of an electric field in the brain.

Deep TMS is largely used for the treatment of drug-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) and is being tested to treat a very wide range of neurological, psychiatric and medical conditions. The aim of this review is to illustrate the biophysical principles of deep TMS, to explain the pathophysiological basis for its utilization in each psychiatric disorder (major depression, autism, bipolar depression, auditory hallucinations, negative symptoms of schizophrenia), to summarize the results presented thus far in the international scientific literature regarding the use of deep TMS in psychiatry, its side effects and its effects on cognitive functions."}, {"Title": "[Anti-suicidal effect of lithium: current state of research and its clinical implications for the long-term treatment of affective disorders].", "Abstract": "Treatment of patients with suicidal behaviour is one of the most challenging tasks for health care professionals.

The diagnostic classes examined were ADHD (39%), depression (31%) and anxiety (13%). This prospective cohort design study collected medical records of 329 children referred to TCPS by 139 PCPs. To detect the likelihood of return to referring pediatricians for follow-up care at discharge from TCPS, we employed logistic regression models. Mean age was 12.3 (SD = 4.0); 43% were female. Ninety-three percent of parents complied with pediatricians' recommendations to have their child assessed by a child psychiatrist. A total of 28.0% of referrals returned to PCPs for follow-up care; the remainder were followed in mental health. Regression findings indicated that children with major depression (OR = 7.5) or anxiety disorders (OR = 5.1) were less likely to return to PCPs compared to ADHD even though severity of psychiatric illness and functional levels did not differ across diagnostic groups. Families widely accepted pediatricians' recommendations for referral to child psychiatrists. Depression and anxiety were strong correlates of retention in mental health settings at discharge from TCPS though children with these disorders appeared to be no more severely ill or functionally limited than peers with ADHD. These children possibly could be managed in a less intensive and expensive primary care treatment setting that could access mental health specialty services as needed in a collaborative model of care.

The best exemplar is HER2 positivity in breast cancer to determine the efficacy of Herceptin. Clinical trials of this anti-cancer drug were initially unpromising, but once the HER2 positive subgroup was identified it was found, in this subgroup only, to be highly effective. It is presumed that similar subgroups will be found for many common disorders not just cancers, and that these will lead to much better targeted treatments. Such an advance may be necessary to develop new treatments in certain fields where the development of broad-spectrum/blockbuster treatments appears to have reached the end of the road; a particular example of this is in psychiatry.

Current historiography is reliant on published physician accounts, and this represents the first study of treatment approaches based on original case notes. We analyzed patient records from two leading departments of academic psychiatry in Germany, those at Berlin and Jena, in conjunction with the contemporaneous medical literature. Treatment, which can be broadly classified into reward and punishment, suggestion, affective shock, cognitive learning, and physiological methods, was developed in the context of the emerging fields of animal learning and neurophysiology. A further innovative feature was the use of quantitative methods to assess outcomes. These measures showed good response rates, though most cured patients were not sent back to battle because of their presumed psychopathic constitution. While some treatments appear unnecessarily harsh from today's perspective and were also criticized by leading psychiatrists of the time, the concentration of effort and involvement of so many senior doctors led to the development of psychotherapeutic methods that were to influence the field of psychiatric therapy for decades to come."}, {"Title": "[The experience of being admitted to a psychiatric clinic: part 1: development of a questionnaire (QAE-P)].", "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to develop a questionnaire to assess the perception and evaluation of admission to a psychiatric hospital from a patient's perspective (QAE-P).\nBased on existing literature and a preparatory pilot study, a questionnaire consisting of 126 items was developed, and 708 inpatients based in 6 psychiatry and psychotherapy clinics were asked to answer the items.

Patients with chronic tinnitus had a stronger SOC and better subjective mood, stronger commitment, and less anger and anxious depression than the patients with chronic pain, chronic asthma or atopic dermatitis. However, in patients with higher tinnitus annoyance, psychological comorbidity was similar to that found in patients with other chronic diseases.\nBesides collecting medical and social history, special psychometric instruments should be used for the diagnosis of tinnitus patients. Based on relative high frequency of psychological comorbidity, we recommend interdisciplinary cooperation between otorhinolaryngologists and other specialists (psychosomatic medicine, psychology or psychiatry) during the treatment of tinnitus patients, especially when high degree of tinnitus annoyance is involved."}, {"Title": "'Doing things together': male caregivers' experiences of giving care to patients in forensic psychiatric care.", "Abstract": "Studies into work carried out by male caregivers in a care environment in which male patients and male caregivers constitute a majority are lacking. The purpose of this study was to illuminate the experiences of male caregivers in providing care for patients in forensic psychiatric care. The study has a qualitative design and data were constituted by interviews with six male caregivers at a clinic of forensic psychiatry in a town in central Sweden. The method of analysis chosen was latent content analysis. The results consist of four themes: Activities as a component of care, Social training as the basis of care, Feelings of powerlessness and Seeing the complete person. The experience that comes out most distinctly in the descriptions given by caregivers involves performing activities together with the patients. The activities had different significances and these contribute to creating a more secure care relationship, in which the boundaries between personnel and patients become less clear. Physical activities contribute to recreating the patient's health. Social training appears as a component of the care in which the significance of rules and routines in the operations was integrated. Feelings of powerlessness arise when the caregivers do not experience that the care given on the ward contributes to recreating health for the patients. Seeing the complete person behind the crime constitutes the themes that can be said to summarize the meaning of the work carried out by male caregivers."}, {"Title": "Evaluating care pathways for community psychiatry in England: a qualitative study.", "Abstract": "In view of forthcoming 'payment by results' (PbR) for mental health, increasing number of National Health Service (NHS) Trusts are reorganizing their community services for working age adults to create care pathways. However, research base for the care pathways model in mental health is limited. Our NHS Foundation Trust was one of the first to introduce care pathways for community psychiatry in the UK. We have carried out a qualitative study to evaluate how this model works out in practice, including its impact on quality of patient care, mental health professionals and primary care.\nWe interviewed doctors, multidisciplinary staff and Trusts managers (19 in total). Transcripts of recorded interviews were coded and analysed thematically using a grounded theory approach.\nOverall, despite teething problems, working in pathways was generally seen as a positive change. It led to more focused interventions being offered, and practitioners being held to account over clear standards of care. It is more cost-effective and allows for active case management and clear clinical leadership. It is recovery focused and encourages social inclusion. The arbitrary time frame, strict criteria and thresholds for different teams can create issues. Improved communication, flexible and patient-centred approach, staff supervision, and increasing support to primary care were felt to be central to this model working efficiently and effectively.\nIntroduction of care pathways is an important step towards effective implementation of PbR for mental health. Our study would inform future research into care pathways, facilitate organizational learning and help to improve effectiveness of services."}, {"Title": "[Psychosocial integration of inpatients with borderline personality disorder: reflection of a health care system focused on symptom remission].", "Abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a profound instability of identity, by stress and affect dysregulation and impulsivity, and by cognitive-perceptual disturbances. These deficits seriously impair interpersonal experiences and social interaction. The typical impulsive style and psychosocial malfunctioning of these patients lead to grave disturbances in their everyday areas of life with numerous break-ups in all relevant areas of life and entail inadequate vocational placement. Despite vast demands on the health care system, BPD attracts little attention of care process research and reintegration measures as, for instance, exist for schizophrenia. At the LVR-Klinikum D\u00fcsseldorf as representative of a large clinic in North Rhein-Westphalia, we analysed socio-demographic characteristics of BPD inpatients. The aims of the study were to substantiate the high impact of the disease on patient's social and vocational integration and to sensitize for significant aspects of disease-specific therapy and care.\nA retrospective analysis of DGPPN-BADO of all patients (n\u2009=\u20099,425) who were admitted between January 2004 and December 2009 to the LVR-Klinikum D\u00fcsseldorf, department of psychiatry and psychotherapy, Heinrich Heine University Hospital, Germany. Data analysis involved the divisions general psychiatry and addictive disorders and covered 999 patients with BPD (ICD-10: F60.3) and 1,937 patients with schizophrenia (ICD-10: F20). The defined characteristics of DGPPN-BADO that depict psychosocial integration were \"living situation at admission\", \"highest academic/professional degree achieved\", \"working situation\" und \"livelihood\". Besides descriptive statistics of the elected variables, comparative analysis of the diagnoses BPD and schizophrenia involved calculating group differences after adjusting the groups for sex and age. Statistical analysis was performed by the \u03c72-test.\nThe comparative analysis of psychosocially relevant BADO characteristics reveals a significantly stronger impairment of patients with BPD concerning their academic and professional qualification than patients with schizophrenia. Nevertheless they more often hold a job or cover their living expenses without subsidy, respectively.\nThe data suggest a lack of general awareness in the significance of social and vocational disturbances in BPD. The interactional deficits of patients with BPD affect all areas of life but their illness-related nature seems to be disregarded in relevant life areas, such as educational processes and the vocational situation. Furthermore, the impact of BPD on earning capacity is not given adequate consideration in the assessment of pensions or subsidies. Consistent with the recent literature, our socio-demographic data indicate significant deficits of the present health system in handling BPD."}, {"Title": "Cumulative genetic risk and prefrontal activity in patients with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The lack of consistency of genetic associations in highly heritable mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, remains a challenge in molecular psychiatry. Because clinical phenotypes for psychiatric disorders are often ill defined, considerable effort has been made to relate genetic polymorphisms to underlying physiological aspects of schizophrenia (so called intermediate phenotypes), that may be more reliable. Given the polygenic etiology of schizophrenia, the aim of this work was to form a measure of cumulative genetic risk and study its effect on neural activity during working memory (WM) using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Neural activity during the Sternberg Item Recognition Paradigm was measured in 79 schizophrenia patients and 99 healthy controls. Participants were genotyped, and a genetic risk score (GRS), which combined the additive effects of 41 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 34 risk genes for schizophrenia, was calculated. These risk SNPs were chosen according to the continuously updated meta-analysis of genetic studies on schizophrenia available at www.schizophreniaresearchforum.org. We found a positive relationship between GRS and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex inefficiency during WM processing. GRS was not correlated with age, performance, intelligence, or medication effects and did not differ between acquisition sites, gender, or diagnostic groups. Our study suggests that cumulative genetic risk, combining the impact of many genes with small effects, is associated with a known brain-based intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia. The GRS approach could provide an advantage over studying single genes in studies focusing on the genetic basis of polygenic conditions such as neuropsychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Pain in the ICU: a psychiatric perspective.", "Abstract": "Pain is abundant in the intensive care unit (ICU). Successful analgesia demands a comprehensive appreciation for the etiologies of pain, vigilant clinical assessment, and personalized treatments. For the critically ill, frequent threats to mental and bodily integrity magnify the experience of pain, challenging clinicians to respond swiftly and thoughtfully. Because pain is difficult to predict and physiologic correlates are not specific, self-report remains the gold standard assessment. When communication is limited by intubation or cognitive deficits, behavioral pain scales prove useful. Patient-tailored analgesia aspires to mitigate suffering while optimizing alertness and cognitive capacity. Mindfulness of the neuropsychiatric features of pain helps the ICU clinician to clarify limits of traditional analgesia and identify alternative approaches to care. Armed with empirical data and clinical practice recommendations to better conceptualize, identify, and treat pain and its neuropsychiatric comorbidities, the authors (psychiatric consultants, by trade) reinforce holistic approaches to pain management in the ICU. After all, without attempts to understand and relieve suffering on all fronts, pain will remain undertreated."}, {"Title": "Exploring the acceptance of religious assistance among patients of a psychiatric hospital.", "Abstract": "Spiritual issues are rarely addressed by psychiatric institutions in daily routine practice.\nTo report the prevalence of, and factors associated with, inpatients' acceptance of religious assistance in a psychiatric hospital.\nAll patients evaluated by the religious assistance service in a psychiatric hospital were included. Patients admitted were asked about their need for religious assistance and were assessed on several religious aspects. Additional information was collected from patients' hospital charts. A comparison between those who accepted the religious assistance and those who did not was performed.\nMost of the 213 patients evaluated requested religious assistance (85.0%), including those that reported having no religion (79.1%). Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (p = .010) and lower intrinsic religiousness (p = .002) tended to request less religious assistance. More than 80% of patients requested assistance based on religious traditions other than their own.\nMost psychiatric inpatients were willing to participate in religious assistance sessions, even those without formal religious affiliations. Patients with lower intrinsic religiosity and schizophrenia tended to request less assistance. We believe the findings of this study can serve to foster discussion on whether psychiatric hospitals should provide a structured religious care service."}, {"Title": "[History of treatment of schizophrenic forensic patients prior to admission: a comparison with schizophrenic general psychiatric patients].", "Abstract": "The number of schizophrenic patients admitted to forensic hospitals according to section 63 of the German Criminal Code has increased continuously over the past years. Prior to admission to a forensic ward, two thirds of schizophrenic patients have been admitted to a general psychiatric institution at least once. Among other factors, forensic admission is seen as a consequence of insufficient pretreatment in general psychiatry. This study aims to identify differences regarding the history of treatment of forensic and general psychiatric patients diagnosed with schizophrenia.\nThe matched samples include 72 male patients from forensic wards and 72 male patients from general psychiatry diagnosed with schizophrenia. The history of psychiatric treatment was reconstructed by interviewing the patients as well as the outpatient psychiatrists and by analyzing these patients' medical records.\nBoth groups showed similar risk factors, however, forensic patients had a higher number of previous convictions and were convicted more often for violent offences. Furthermore, the data indicate that forensic patients are less integrated into psychiatric care and showed a lower rate of treatment compliance prior to admission to a forensic ward.\nThe results provide support for the arrangement of an intensive outpatient aftercare, especially for schizophrenic patients with comorbid substance abuse disorders and previous convictions for violent offences."}, {"Title": "Merleau-Ponty's sexual schema and the sexual component of body integrity identity disorder.", "Abstract": "Body integrity identity disorder (BIID), formerly also known as apotemnophilia, is characterized by a desire for amputation of a healthy limb and is claimed to straddle or to even blur the boundary between psychiatry and neurology. The neurological line of approach, however, is a recent one, and is accompanied or preceded by psychodynamical, behavioural, philosophical, and psychiatric approaches and hypotheses. Next to its confusing history in which the disorder itself has no fixed identity and could not be classified under a specific discipline, its sexual component has been an issue of unclarity and controversy, and its assessment a criterion for distinguishing BIID from apotemnophilia, a paraphilia. Scholars referring to the lived body-a phenomenon primarily discussed in the phenomenological tradition in philosophy-seem willing to exclude the sexual component as inessential, whereas other authors notice important similarities with gender identity disorder or transsexualism, and thus precisely focus attention on the sexual component. This contribution outlines the history of BIID highlighting the vicissitudes of its sexual component, and questions the justification for distinguishing BIID from apotemnophilia and thus for omitting the sexual component as essential. Second, we explain a hardly discussed concept from Maurice Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception (1945a), the sexual schema, and investigate how the sexual schema could function in interaction with the body image in an interpretation of BIID which starts from the lived body while giving the sexual component its due."}, {"Title": "High-resolution functional MRI of the human amygdala at 7 T.", "Abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become the primary non-invasive method for investigating the human brain function. With an increasing number of ultra-high field MR systems worldwide possibilities of higher spatial and temporal resolution in combination with increased sensitivity and specificity are expected to advance detailed imaging of distinct cortical brain areas and subcortical structures. One target region of particular importance to applications in psychiatry and psychology is the amygdala. However, ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging of these ventral brain regions is a challenging endeavor that requires particular methodological considerations. Ventral brain areas are particularly prone to signal losses arising from strong magnetic field inhomogeneities along susceptibility borders. In addition, physiological artifacts from respiration and cardiac action cause considerable fluctuations in the MR signal. Here we show that, despite these challenges, fMRI data from the amygdala may be obtained with high temporal and spatial resolution combined with increased signal-to-noise ratio. Maps of neural activation during a facial emotion discrimination paradigm at 7 T are presented and clearly show the gain in percental signal change compared to 3T results, demonstrating the potential benefits of ultra-high field functional MR imaging also in ventral brain areas."}]
