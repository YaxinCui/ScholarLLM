[{"Title": "J. Robert Oppenheimer: a faith development portrait.", "Abstract": "J. Robert Oppenheimer was among the most important and enigmatic figures in 20th century science. He is best known for successfully directing the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Subsequently, he became a scientist and statesman who advised the United States government in the areas of atomic weapons development and public policy. He later became subject to an investigation in 1954 into his previous political affiliations and his personal behavior that ended in the revoking of his security clearance. This essay seeks to chronicle Oppenheimer's coming of age as a public intellectual with a view toward his own psychological history and most especially in relationship to the stages of faith development articulated by James Fowler and colleagues. Moreover, though not conventionally religious, Oppenheimer's life and thought were permeated with themes and ideas of a religious and ethical nature that shaped his adult character and informed his view of the world. This essay was originally presented at The Richardson History of Psychiatry Research Seminar at Weill Cornell Medical College."}, {"Title": "[Typology and systematization of residual mental disorders in alcohol dependence].", "Abstract": "The study of 85 patients with alcohol dependence appointed to forensic psychiatric expertise in the Serbsky research center of social and forensic psychiatry revealed the manifestation of polymorphic psychiatric and behavioral disorders (ICD-10 diagnosis F10.7--residual and late-onset psychotic disorders) after stopping the intoxication, withdrawal and post-withdralwal disorders. Taking into account the multifactor etiology of psychiatric disorders which are observed after ending of the direct effect of alcohol, a possibility of including other ICD-10 items to extend their diagnostics and thus provide the more accurate clinical verification of these states, is discussed."}, {"Title": "[Predictors of prophylactic response to lithium].", "Abstract": "Since their first utilization in psychiatry as mood stabilizers in the 1940s, lithium salts have been widely studied in the medical literature. The considerable amount of data available to date, supports the use of lithium salts as first-line mood stabilizing agents, with acute antimanic and antidepressant properties and proven efficacy in the long term prevention of manic and depressive relapses.\nSeveral predictors were reported by different authors in early articles and were confirmed later on by the medical literature. All the psychopathological, environmental, biological, neurophysiologic and genetic predictors known to date are reviewed here. PSYCHOLOGICAL PREDICTORS: Psychopathological predictors of a good response to lithium prophylaxis include: the initial good response to lithium during the first 6-12 months of treatment, considered to date to be the most reliable predictor of a favourable response to lithium; the classical pattern of elated manic episodes; a positive familial history of bipolar disorders, especially those known to be responsive to lithium; the absence of comorbid personality disorders; bipolar type I disorders; melancholic features during depressive episodes; MDI pattern in the illness course and early onset of lithium treatment. In contrast, the following have been confirmed as psychopathological predictors of poor prophylactic lithium response: mixed episodes, considered to be one of the most reliable predictors of poor response to lithium since Kraeplin's description; rapid cycling bipolar disorders; comorbid alcohol and/or drug abuse; mood disorders with incongruent psychotic features; early onset bipolar disorder before the age of 18; discontinuation of lithium treatment; high number of previous affective episodes in the illness course before lithium initiation and DMI pattern. ENVIRONMENTAL PREDICTORS: Among environmental factors, being single was found to be the only predictor of a poor response to lithium treatment in prophylaxis. BIOLOGICAL PREDICTORS: Biological predictors of a good prophylactic response to lithium include a high RBC/plasma-lithium ratio, one of the most controversial predictors of a favourable response to lithium in the literature, a higher platelet serotonin-induced calcium mobilization, and a high rate of red blood cell membrane phospholipids, especially of phosphatidylcholine, and a phospholipid implicated in lithium intracellular transport. Among neurophysiologic predictors of a favourable response to lithium, the following have been reported: brain lithium concentrations above 0.2 mEq/L when measured by 7Li-MRS; decreased cerebral intracellular pH and white matter hyper intensity at (31)P-MRS and a high intensity of loudness dependence auditory-evoked potentials (LDAEP), the latter being one of the best indicators of human cerebral serotoninergic functioning. In contrast, the following have been reported as neurophysiological predictors of a poor lithium response in prophylaxis: epileptiform anomalies with diffuse theta waves on electroencephalography, a predictor of poor response to lithium known since the descriptions of Dalen in 1965 and decreased cerebral phosphocreatine levels at (31)P-MRS, the latter being an indicator of cerebral mitochondrial dysfunction. GENETIC PREDICTORS: Genetic predictors of good response to lithium in prophylaxis include a lower-inositol-monophosphatase (IMPase-2) mRNA expression, IMPase-2 being a key enzyme of the calcium-intracellular-signalling pathway and IMPase-2 gene being studied recently as a candidate gene in bipolar disorder. A higher frequency of phospholipase C isoenzyme gamma1 (PLCG1)-5 repeat allele genes has also been associated with a good response to lithium, PLCG1 being a major enzyme of the phosphatidylinositol second messenger system. Genetic predictors of negative prophylactic lithium response include the homozygotic forms of the short allele of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT), the presence of the A/A subtype of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) gene and a high frequency of human leukocyte antigens type A3 (HLA-A3), this genotype being associated with cellular membrane anomalies implicated in alteration of lithium intracellular transport.\nThe search for new predictors of lithium prophylactic response is currently facing several methodological problems: lack of representativity of the samples of bipolar patients enrolled in research studies, poor reliability of retrospective reconstructions of the course of the bipolar disorder before initiation of lithium treatment, absence of consensus on tools used to assess response to lithium prophylaxis in study designs, difficult access and high costs of most of the laboratory and neuroimaging techniques used in recent studies such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy and LDAEP measures, and problematic evaluation of the impact of treatment on a disorder whose natural intrinsic course is often irregular."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatric autopsy: its uses and limits in France].", "Abstract": "Within the framework of an evaluation program for the prevention of suicide in Brittany conducted by the academic department of psychiatry (University of Rennes, Brittany, France), we have addressed the issue of the potential usefulness of psychological autopsy as a tool for the better comprehension of suicide risk factors.\nWe reviewed the appropriate literature in 30 articles found amongst those obtained from the \"Medline\" database. These articles were selected according to the quality of their methodology. For the Medline data retrieval search, the following keywords were used: \"psychological autopsy\", \"psychiatric autopsy\", \"psychological autopsy and methodology\", \"psychiatric autopsy and methodology\". This review's objective was to determine, firstly the nature and the content of psychological autopsies, secondly to evaluate their use as a methodological tool to assist the comprehension and prevention of suicide. Finally, it was also to assess its feasibility for use in France.\nThe majority of the published studies using psychological autopsy for the evaluation of suicide expertise came from Scandinavian or Anglo-Saxon countries. Schneidman [Schneidman ES. The psychological autopsy. Suicide Life Threat Behav 1981;11:325-40], whose aim was to clarify the causes of sudden death related to psychological circumstances, focused on suicidal intentions and the symptoms exhibited. He coined the term: \"psychological autopsy\". Gradually, the definition of psychological autopsy has evolved and is now being used for the evaluation of death by suicide with a single goal in mind: to retrospectively identify any suicidal predictive and risk factors available at the time of the event. At present, no unequivocal definition of \"psychological autopsy\" has been put forth. However, this formerly only descriptive procedure is now becoming more analytical in nature (comparison of psychiatric profiles between pre- and postmortem assessments, research on precipitating factors, comorbidity studies...). Presently, it corresponds to a methodological tool to be used essentially for case reports that vary a great deal and do not permit cross-comparisons with other case-studies. For the past fifteen years, case-control studies in this field have become more frequent with various choices of control groups: healthy subjects with no psychiatric history, as well as attempted suicides, with or without a psychiatric history. Partial standardization of autopsy procedures is now possible with some data extracted from police inquiries, medical charts, or data gathered following interviews with the deceased patient's relatives.\nIn the aggregate, the literature review showed that the aims of psychological autopsy include understanding and prevention of suicide in a population-based sample. It seems difficult to generalize with results from other population references. In France, the use of psychological autopsy as a standardized tool for the assessment of suicidal behaviors would be difficult, due to the complexity of the procedures involved: data coming from external sources, such as medical sources, is nearly impossible to obtain. Practitioners would be required to overcome administrative rules and regulations, plus incurring the high costs of such procedures. They must also take into account ethical considerations that make such interviews with the deceased patient's relatives difficult to obtain. Be this as it may, the French Ministry of Health is presently attempting to find a solution in order to alleviate the all too frequent problem of suicide in the population at large and to promote suicide prevention in France."}, {"Title": "[Clinical particularism of bipolar disorder: unipolar mania. About a patient's study in Tunesia].", "Abstract": "Although present classifications (CIM, DSM) have not included the notion of a unipolar disorder to characterise the recurrence of the same type of episode, this concept conserves its pertinence for many people. Unipolar mania, in particular, is a clinical reality in our daily practice, and a predominant form of bipolarity expression. These assertions have led us to question this notion and its nosographical place: is it a subtype, distinguished by certain characteristics, or a particular category in the bipolar disorder?\nWe conducted a retrospective, descriptive and comparative study on medical briefs of patients with type I bipolar disorder (DSM-IV criteria), who were interned for the first time between 1997 and 2001 in the Psychiatry \"E\" service of the Razi hospital of Tunis, and were followed up for at least five years. Two groups were identified: Group 1 or \"unipolar mania\": patients who presented at least two manic episodes without depression, and Group 2: the rest of the sample; and then were compared based on their sociodemographical profile, familial psychiatric antecedents, premorbid temperament, comorbidity and clinical and progressive characteristics.\nSeventy-two patients were included. The average age was 36. The sex ratio was three men to two women. The first episode was a manic episode in 56.9% of the cases. The average duration of illness progression was 11.6 years. Unipolar mania represented 65.3% of the sample. Between 1997 and 2001, 92% of bipolar patients interned were hospitalised for mania. Concerning recurrences, we observed nine times as many cases of manic episodes as depression. Depressive episodes of light to medium intensity had probably not been well assessed due to the families' tolerance. The high rates of both manic episodes and unipolar mania observed in this study were also found by other authors, showing the differences of bipolarity expression between the West and the other parts of the world, and in particular Africa. There was no significant difference concerning the sociodemographical features. We noticed similar results in the literature. The two groups were comparable in familial psychiatric past history and premorbid temperament. Substance abuse or dependence was observed in 5.6% of the patients. This rate was less than others found in the literature, due to the fact that it is considered as an offence in our country. We found twice as many cases of toxic consumption in bipolar as in unipolar manic patients. A recent Tunisian study has shown the absence of substance abuse in unipolar manic patients. This is probably because of the fact that substance abuse is more related to depressive manifestations. The sample starting age was 24.6 years and was significantly more precocious in the unipolar manic group (27.6 years versus 23 years, p=0.001). A significant difference in both groups was found concerning the first episode season: two extremities were observed: \"summer-autumn\" in Group 1 (63.6% G1 versus 29.4% G2) and \"winter-spring\" in Group 2 (73.6% G2 versus 36.4% G1), p=0.03. The seasonal influence on mood disorders is dealt with by other authors. Unipolar manic patients presented less affective recurrences than the rest of the group (0.37 versus 0.49 on average per year), p=0.056.\nUnipolar mania is still considered as a clinical variety of bipolar disorder, which is distinguished by certain features. It is a debated notion because it is based on retrospective studies that may be insufficient, although it appears as a clinical evidence and a predominant progressive variety of bipolar disorder in Tunisia."}, {"Title": "\"Hysteria\" near the end of the twentieth century in Athens.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to study the frequencies of clinical manifestations traditionally associated with the concept of \"hysteria\", namely conversion, dissociation, and somatization in the emergency room of the Department of Psychiatry in Athens in the late 1990s, in a period of significant social change of the Greek culture towards more Western standards. We used a retrospective chart review of all new emergency room cases in a representative two-year period (1995-1997), replicating the method and the diagnostic classification of a study from our Department published 25 years ago, investigating similar changes in these symptoms in previous periods of change in the Greek social structure. Of 7424 new cases 215 (2.9%) fulfilled criteria for \"hysteria\", a significant reduction from the original study. Of these 28 were foreign, mostly from non-Western cultural settings. Male to female ratio (1:3) and mean age remained unchanged from the original study. Hysterical fits (pseudoseizures) were significantly less in comparison to the original study. Mental and vegetative conversion (corresponding to dissociative and somatoform disorders, respectively) remained unchanged, mixed conversion increased while changes in somatic conversion (conversion disorder) depended on the nationality of the patients. Over the last quarter century in Athens rates of patients with so called \"hysterical symptoms\" continue to decrease, as do the most dramatic presentations. These reductions however, are not so great to suggest a disappearance of the syndrome, while increase of the mixed forms suggest that sub-syndromes may have common underlying mechanisms. This may point towards a single disease process with multiple presentations rather than separate diagnostic categories. Culture appears to influence clinical expression of symptoms."}, {"Title": "[Pharmacogenetics and treatment response in schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "The pharmacogenetic strategy uses the genetic association approach with the aim of identifying genes that influence clinical response to drug treatment. Association studies have focused mainly on neuroleptics (in particular clozapine) and variants in candidate genes of dopamine and serotonin systems in schizophrenic patients. Concerning the serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor gene, the frequency of allele tyrosine (versus histidine) at 452 was greater among nonresponders, and homozygosity for the cytosine allele at 102 was more frequent among nonresponders. In the serotonin 5-HT(2C) receptor gene, a cysteine to serine substitution at 23 was considered as a predictor of good response to clozapine. Concerning the dopamine D2 receptor gene, the patients with one or two A1 alleles showed greater improvement than those with no A1 allele (Taq1A genotype). In addition, compared with patients who exhibited a Del allele at 141, patients with no Del allele showed better clinical response. Regarding the dopamine D3 receptor gene, the homozygous genotype serine/serine at 9 was found to be more frequent among the nonresponders. Finally, there was a possible relationship between the 48 bp variant number tandem repeat polymorphism in dopamine D4 receptor gene and response to neuroleptics.\nHowever, some results conflict with other data in the literature. The frequent difficulties in replication of pharmacogenetic findings can be explained by, among others: (i) the lack of a consistent definition of drug response; (ii) the use of different scales to evaluate response to treatment and the use of several cut-offs for the same scale; (iii) the sample heterogeneity and the small sample size; and (iv) the multigenic interactions. In order for research to progress, methodological consistency must be achieved, not only to form the basis of comparison among studies and to confirm or invalidate previous results, but also to allow for meta-analysis between the various studies. Nevertheless Kane et al. [Arch Gen Psychiatry 45 (1988) 789-796] have defined precise criteria of clinical response, but they are restrictive and quite difficult to set up in practice. Pharmacogenetic research has the following advantages: (i) it is based on the individual patient's genotype, invariable data in normal conditions, and can therefore be measured at any time during treatment; (ii) it uses reliable molecular biological techniques; and (iii) it is in constant progress because of the increasing amount of genomic information available.\nIn future, a combination of several polymorphisms showing a strong association with a specific neuroleptic response could constitute a clinical test to predict the individual response to such treatment, and therefore participate in the prescription process. A research team has already proposed a combination of six polymorphisms implicating 5-HT(2A) receptor, 5-HT(2C) receptor, 5-HTTLPR, and H2 receptor genes [Lancet 355 (2000) 1615-1616], but this result has to be replicated. Until now, pharmacogenetics has focused on the global clinical response, but in the years to come, it could focus on the genes implied in the effects of treatments on specific symptoms and on physiological mechanisms that would explain how gene polymorphism can influence therapeutic response. This review aims to summarise recent advances and to present future clinical applications for pharmacogenetics."}, {"Title": "[The onset of psychiatric disorders and Wilson's disease].", "Abstract": "Wilson's disease is an infrequent, autosomic recessive pathology, resulting from a loss of function of an adenosine triphosphatase (ATP7B or WDNP), secondarily to a change (more than 60 are described currently), insertion or deletion of the ATP7B gene located on the chromosome 13q14.3-q21.1, which involves a reduction or an absence of the transport of copper in the bile and its accumulation in the body, notably the brain. Wilson's disease is transmitted by an autosomic recessive gene located on the long arm of chromosome 13. The prevalence of the heterozygote is evaluated at 1/90 and the homozygote at 1/30,000. Consanguinity, frequent in the socially geographically isolated populations, increases the prevalence of the disease. The toxic quantities of copper, which accumulate in the liver since early childhood and perhaps before, remain concentrated in the body for years. Hence, cytological and histological modifications can be detected in the biopsies, before the appearance of clinical or biological symptoms of hepatic damage. The accumulation of copper in the liver is due to a defect in the biliary excretion of metal and is accompanied invariably by a deficit in ceruloplasmin; protein synthesized from a transferred ATP7B gene, which causes retention of the copper ions in the liver. The detectable cellular anomalies are of two types: hepatic lesions resulting in acute hepatic insufficiency, acute hepatitis and finally advanced cirrhosis and lesions of the central nervous system responsible for the neurological and psychiatric disorders. In approximately 40-50% of the patients, the first manifestation of Wilson's disease affects the central nervous system. Although copper diffuses in the liver towards the blood and then towards other tissues, it has disastrous consequences only in the brain. It can therefore cause either a progressive neurological disease, or psychiatric disorders. Wilson's disease begins in the form of a hepatic, neurological, or psychiatric disease in at least 90% of the patients. In some rare cases, the first manifestations of the disease can be psychiatric which, according to the literature, accounts for only 10% of the cases. The disease can be revealed by isolated behavioral problems, an irrational syndrome, a schizophrenic syndrome, or a manic-depressive syndrome. Damage to the central nervous system can be more severe, thus, several differential diagnoses have been discussed: a psychotic disorder of late appearance; a depressive state; a mental confusion disorder. The clinical syndrome is complex. Indeed, it is the polymorphism, which dominates in the description of the psychiatric demonstrations of the disease. This can lead to prejudicial diagnostic wandering, particularly since heavy sedative treatment may be required to suppress behavioral problems. Clinically, Wilson's disease generally appears between the age of 10 and 20. It rarely remains masked until after the age of 40. The first manifestations are hepatic (40% of the cases), neurological (35%) or psychiatric (10%). The inaugural disorder can finally take on a haematological, renal, or mixed form in approximately 15% of the cases. We have detailed the principal clinical elements. In approximately 40-50% of the patients, the first manifestation of the disease affects the central nervous system, where it can cause either a progressive neurological disease, or psychiatric disorders. The ophthalmologic disorder is dominated by Kayser-Fleischer's ring, representing a green or bronze colored ring on the periphery of the cornea. It occupies the higher pole of the cornea, then the lower pole, and extends to the whole circumference. It is generally only visible under examination with a slit lamp. It disappears on average within 3-5 years following copper chelating therapy. Kayser-Fleischer's ring has been described other than in Wilson's disease, in exceptional cases of prolonged cholestasis. On haematological level, the hyperhaemolysis is due to the toxicity of the ionic copper, released massively in the plasma by hepatocellular necrosis. The other manifestations can be found in the following organs: renal, osteoarticular, cardiac, endocrine, cutaneous, and in the teguments. Until 1952, the diagnosis was evoked only on clinical symptomatology. It can henceforth be marked unambiguous, even in the absence of any symptom, by the description of a ceruloplasmin plasma concentration of less than 200 ml/l, and of a Kayser-Fleischer's ring. Hepatic copper on sample is constantly increased during the disease (from 3 to 25 micromol/g of dry weight). On the other hand, the absence of a reduction in the plasma ceruloplasmin does not make it possible to exclude the diagnosis. Conversely, a reduction in ceruloplasmin can exist other than in Wilson's disease (nephritic syndrome, malabsorption syndrome, or severe hepatic insufficiency). Kayser-Fleischer's ring is quasiconstant among patients with neuropsychiatric demonstrations (thus, its absence represents a very strong argument against the diagnosis). It can on the other hand be lacking during hepatic forms, and in this case, its absence is not an argument against the diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging can reveal abnormal signals of the grey cores. A genetic study is conducted by liaison analysis in the event of a family history of the disease. When it is not treated, Wilson's disease induces lesions of the tissues, the outcome of which is always fatal. Treatment relies on the regulation of copper chelation, which improves the prognosis, and zinc, which captures the copper in a nontoxic form. The severe psychiatric disorders observed during Wilson's disease may require tranquilizers, but care should be taken because of potential neurological or hepatic side effects. Lithium seems an interesting treatment and remains theoretically indicated, taking into account the scarcity of the extrapyramidal symptoms and the hepatic dysfunction among patients at the stage of cirrhosis, since it is not metabolized in the liver. Although rare, it is important to approach Wilson's disease in psychiatry because the psychiatric manifestations can precede the somatic disorders and help to pose the diagnosis. We stress the importance of the early diagnosis of the pathology, the outcome of which is fatal in the absence of specific treatment."}, {"Title": "[New directions for psychotherapy research: an evaluation of a research protocol and a methodological and technical framework proposal].", "Abstract": "A recent report of the French research institute INSERM, based on a comprehensive review of the work done on the evaluation of psychotherapies Psychoth\u00e9rapies: trois approches \u00e9valu\u00e9es, has shown the lack of research in France on this topic, notably in psychodynamic psychotherapy. The development of such research is needed. The first part of the paper deals with the limits of the third generation of studies on psychotherapy (medical model, use of RCT, DSM...) on which the INSERM report is based and reviews the existing propositions for a fourth generation of research in the field. METHODOLOGICAL FINDINGS: In the second part, a process-outcome research protocol developed by the authors, according to these new proposals as well as several on-going researches [J Clin Psychol, 27 2 (1998) 217-26, J Pragm Case Stud 3 (2000)(2), Arch Gen Psychiatry 59 (2002) 505-10, Psychother Res 12 3 (2002) 251-72 and Br J Psychiatry 165 (1994) 4-8] is presented. The proposed methodology is based on controlled single case studies. Quantitative and qualitative data are associated for the definition of the diagnosis, as well as initial, intermediate and final measures. Process analysis is used to describe the main characteristics of the on-going psychotherapy at different moments in time. It is thus possible to gain access to what is really done during the therapy and not only to what is supposed to be done, based on a manual or even on the name of the theory used by the therapist.\nThis methodology was tested during a one-year pilot study, in true conditions of psychotherapy with outpatients. The different phases of the analysis are presented: several tools dedicated to the observation, formalisation and data analysis are integrated in a coherent iterative process during the whole therapy. The interests and limits of each tool (ESM, DSM, PPQS, Hoglend, CORE...) are described together with the first results of the pilot study.\nThe overall architecture of a database designed to collect, search and analyse data is provided in the last part of the paper.\nThis framework offers two possibilities at the same time: it provides therapists with the ability to follow the evolution of their cases and to compare them with similar cases. It provides researchers with the ability to drive true comparative analysis, based on psychotherapies conducted in real situations and on detailed-enough descriptions to obtain significant outcomes."}, {"Title": "Assessing patient preferences for delivery of reminders on scheduled visits in a psychiatry ambulatory service.", "Abstract": "Reminder systems can improve compliance with care standards, yet reminder delivery parameters and associations with other success factors have not been fully understood. In this study, we assessed patient preferences for reminder delivery in a psychiatry ambulatory service, using both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results from a survey showed that most patients had a positive attitude to reminders for both scheduled (76%) and missed (89%) visits. Phone call (61%) delivered two days before an appointment (47%) was the most preferred type and time of reminder delivery. Logistic regressions on survey data showed that preferences of reminder delivery parameters were associated with service types and patient populations, which was cross-validated by follow-up interviews with the staff at two study sites. A single-mode reminder delivering method cannot satisfy different types of patients. Intervention designs that involve building a system with a variety of methods customized to patient needs and balanced with administrative simplicity need to be further studied."}, {"Title": "[Current issues in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Psychiatry is the branch of medicine concerned with the defining and diagnosing mental disorders, finding ways of treatment, developing methods for determining causes, and conceiving measures for prevention of mental disorders. Psychiatry has greatly advanced over the last two decades. In our country, however, due to prejudice and ignorance, mental disorders are still often considered incurable and alarming by the general public as well as by physicians, and psychiatric patients are stigmatized and marginalized by the society.\nPsychiatry has an important role in the contemporary medicine and society in general, considering the increasing number of people suffering from mental disorders, disability they cause, and their frequent simultaneous occurrence with various physical illnesses, especially chronic ones. Comorbidity of physical and mental disorders makes the treatment more difficult and time-consuming, whereas an unrecognized and untreated mental disorder has a negative impact on the prognosis and outcome of the physical illness.\nBecause of the great advances in psychopharmacology and etiopathological research, as well as development of new classifications, contemporary psychiatry integrates biological, psychological and social aspects into an integrative biopsychosocial approach to etiopathogenesis, manifestations, course, treatment, and outcome of mental disorders. In fact, this means that the etiological factors of a psychiatric disorder include mutually interacting biological (genetic, neuroanatomical, biochemical, etc), psychological (personality/temperament), and social (background, stressful life events) factors. Therefore, the treatment itself involves application of biological, psychological and social methods. THE POSITION OF'PSYCHIATRY IN OUR COUNTRY: The significant increase in the number of people suffering fiom mental disorders (depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse disorders) underlines the importance of psychiatry in our country. It is also clear that psychiatric services need to be reformed. In order for this reorganization to be effective it is necessary to review the current conditions, include both mental health specialists and general physicians, provide financial resources, and carry it out gradually, with an adequate support from the health care administration."}, {"Title": "'The clinico-diagnostic perspective in psychopathology' by K Kahlbaum.", "Abstract": "Karl Kahlbaum (1828-99) introduced the concept of time into European psychiatric nosology. In 1863 he first expressed the view that disease definition should take into account the course of the disease, the extension to which psychological functions were compromised, the relevance of the period of life when the mental disorder first appeared, and its primary or secondary nature. Via E. Kraepelin these ideas have moulded the way in which mental disorder has been conceived ever since. And yet Kahlbaum never made it into academic psychiatry. For reasons which remain obscure, he did not obtain a university teaching position and had to spend the rest of his life in private psychiatry.

It enacted legislation covering the care and treatment of the mentally ill and created a division of the Department of Public Health, the Psychiatric Services Branch (PSB), which both recruited and trained psychiatric staff, meeting the need for nonmedical staff by creating a programme for the training of psychiatric nurses in Saskatchewan. The PSB devised the Saskatchewan Plan for the delivery of rural services, centred on small mental hospitals of a revolutionary design. Even though never fully instantiated, the Plan commanded worldwide attention. Saskatchewan was also remarkable for its research programmes, covering almost all aspects of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Influence of cannabis use on suicidal ideations among 491 high-school students].", "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the relative contributions of cannabis use and depressive symptoms in the prediction of suicidal ideation.\nA random sample of 491 high-school students from the department of Haute-Garonne, France (290 girls, mean age=16.6+/-1.4; 201 boys, mean age=17.3 years+/-1.6) completed a questionnaire assessing cannabis use, the CES-D (center for epidemiological studies-depression scale) completed by the three-item sub-scale measuring suicidal ideation proposed by Garrison et al. (J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry 30 (1991) 636-641).\nIn the total sample, 15% of girls (n=44) and 23% of boys (n=46) reported having used cannabis at least once a month during the last three months. The mean CES-D score for girls was significantly higher than for boys (20.6+/-11 versus 18.4+/-10.9, t=2.4, p=0.01). According to the cut-off score of 24, 22% of boys and 36% of girls exhibited a moderate to severe depressive symptomatology (p=0.02). The mean suicidal ideation score was not significantly higher in girls than in boys (1.3+/-2 versus 0.95+/-1.9, t=1.7, p=0.10). At least, the occasional wish to kill oneself was reported by 17% of boys and 20% of girls (p=0.40). The contribution of cannabis use and depressive symptomatology in the prediction of suicidal ideation were tested with a hierarchical multiple regression analysis, to determine whether cannabis use improved prediction of suicidal ideation beyond that afforded by CES-D scores. In the first step, including age and sex as covariates, the model accounted for a significant and important part of the variance of suicidal ideation (41%). Age and sex were not significant predictors. The second step, with cannabis use added to the prediction of suicidal ideation, afforded an increase of 1% in predictable variance. Cannabis use (beta=0.08, t=2.2, p=0.03) was significantly but weakly related to suicidal ideation, while depressive symptoms (beta=0.63, t=17.8, p<0.001) remained the main predictor. In a second regression analysis conducted among cannabis users, frequency of use was almost a significant predictor (beta=0.11, t=1.84, p=0.07).\nThis result suggests an association between suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms and cannabis use in adolescents. Cannabis use appeared to be an independent predictor of suicidal ideation after controlling for depressive symptoms. However, the increment of variance accounted for by cannabis use was small. This suggests that cannabis use contributes to suicidal ideation independently from depressive symptoms, but weakly. A limitation to the study was the absence of control for other potential confounding variables. The association between cannabis use and suicidal ideation may be linked to common risk factors such as borderline personality disorder traits, sociodemographic and family factors. In this study, cannabis use does not appear as an important risk factor for suicidal ideation in adolescents."}, {"Title": "[Depressive disorders and quality of life: a cross sectional study including 360 depressive patients followed at the psychiatry consultation of the Mahdia university hospital].", "Abstract": "Depressive disorders affect many psychosocial and functional aspects, leading to a real social handicap and an alteration in quality of life.\nOur purposes were to evaluate the depressive patient's quality of life and to identify the risk factors responsible for this deterioration.\nOur cross sectional study lasted for four months, from 1st March to 30th June 2003, and included 360 depressive patients followed at the psychiatry consultation of the university hospital in Mahdia. The data were collected with a questionnaire composed of 60 items exploring the general characteristics of subjects, the clinical and evolutional characteristics of depressive disorder and providing information on the treatment. Quality of life was measured using the SF-36 (short form) generic scale. A global average score was calculated and it was considered that quality of life was altered if the score was less than 66.7, according to the threshold value of L\u00e9an [Arch Intern Med 159 (1999) 837-843]. Moreover, an average score was calculated for each dimension, thus permitting us to identify those most affected. We standardized initial average scores.\nThe assessment of quality of life revealed a global average score of 44.6 and an alteration in 81% of patients. The study of the dimensional average scores revealed that all dimensions were affected. The standardization also revealed deterioration in all the dimensions, with the mental component particularly more affected than the physical component with respectively estimated scores of 37.3 and 39.1. The analytic approach concerned the relationship between qualitative and quantitative variables and the occurrence of an alteration in quality of life. For this effect, a bivariate study displayed a statistically significant correlation between the eight dimensions of the SF-36 and 20 variables. In order to take into account the relationships which link each variable to the others, and to avoid the bias of the bivariate study, a logistic regression analysis was carried out. Only 12 variables with truly discriminating weight emerged from this analysis. According to the number of dimensions affected, the following factors were classified in decreasing order: the presence of at least two suicide attempts, the association of a psychotropic, the partial or absent observance, the feminine gender, the presence of somatic diseases, the absence of autonomy, the low social-economic level, the presence of a recent hospitalization (<12 months), the age greater than 45 years, the marital status of widow or separated, the number of children under charge greater than five and the presence of severe side effects.\nThis clinimetric approach permitted us to consider the whole life of each patient suffering from depressive disorder, rather than just the angle of their illness."}, {"Title": "[Qualifying language disorders of schizophrenia through the speech therapists' assessment].", "Abstract": "This study investigates a comprehensive assessment of language disorders in order to identify impaired and unaffected language abilities of individuals with schizophrenia. Furthermore, the purpose of this study was to demonstrate the importance of the role of speech therapists in the treatment of schizophrenia. Speech therapy is especially thought to treat language disorders. However, to date, speech therapists have not been solicited in the treatment of schizophrenia, despite growing evidence supporting that schizophrenia is characterized by cognitive disorders such as impairments in memory, attention, executive functioning and language. In this article, we discuss the fact that elements of language and cognition are interactively affected and that cognition influences language. We then demonstrate that language impairments can be treated in the same way as neurological language impairments (cerebrovascular disease, brain injury), in order to reduce their functional outcome. Schizophrenia affects the pragmatic component of language with a major negative outcome in daily living skills [Champagne M, Stip E, Joanette Y. Social cognition deficit in schizophrenia: accounting for pragmatic deficits in communication abilities? Curr Psychiatry Rev:2006;(2):309-315]. The results of our comprehensive assessment also provide a basis for the design of a care plan. For this, subjects with schizophrenia were examined for language comprehension and language production with a focus on pragmatic abilities. In neurology, standardized tests are available that have been designed specifically to assess language functions. However, no such tests are available in psychiatry, so we gathered assessments widely used in neurology and examined the more relevant skills. In this article, each test we chose is described and particular attention is paid to the information they provided on impaired language abilities in schizophrenia. In this manner, we provide an accurate characterization of schizophrenia-associated language impairments and offer a solid foundation for rehabilitation. Current research makes connections between schizophrenia and other neurological disorders concerning language. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to explore these connections to complete our investigations. The strategies we designed are aimed at enabling a subject with schizophrenia to improve his/her language skills. We support the idea that such improvement could be reached by speech therapy. We conclude that speech therapists can play an important role in the non pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia, by selecting appropriate interventions that capitalize on spared abilities to compensate for impaired abilities."}, {"Title": "[Therapies used in Hospital Col\u00f4nia Sant'Ana: the cradle of psychiatry in Santa Catarina State, Brazil (1941-1960)].", "Abstract": "This article is a qualitative research with socio-historical approach which aimed at describing the history of the treatment given to psychiatric patients hospitalized in the old Hospital named Col\u00f4nia Sant'Ana, in the period between 1941 and 1960.

To the inseparable history of eugenics and human genetics].", "Abstract": "The article reconstructs the emergence of institutionalized research programs in the field of psychiatric genetics. It focuses on the first institutions in this field in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States: the Genealogisch-Demographische Abteilung (GDA) at the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt f\u00fcr Psychiatrie in Munich founded in 1917/18; the Program (later: Department) of Medical Genetics at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, associated with Columbia University, and founded in 1936; and the Psychiatric Genetics Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry in London, founded in 1959. The early protagonists which today are considered the founding-fathers of this field in Britain and the USA, Eliot Slater and Franz Kallmann, both had been research fellows at the Munich GDA in the mid-1930s which at that time was directed by Ernst R\u00fcdin. R\u00fcdin was perceived as the leading personality in the field internationally; at the same time, he was one of the protagonists of the German movement of eugenics and racial hygiene, and after the Nazi-takeover in 1933 closely co-operated with the regime in regard to health and racial policies. The contribution documents that not only R\u00fcdin, but also Kallmann and Slater throughout their career in medical genetics until the 1960s were motivated by eugenic ideas, and engaged in eugenic organisations, - however, with different consequences, and in different political contexts.

People with this disorder may experience emotional stress, particularly if vitiligo develops on visible areas of the body, such as face, hands, arms, feet, or on the genitals. Some feel embarrassed, ashamed, depressed, or worried about how others will react. Severel indices have been used from time to time to measure the extent of psychiatric disabilty caused by skin disorders. Regarding vitiligo, not much work has been done in Pakistan. This study was aimed to determine the frequency and pattern of psychiatric disorders amongst patients with vitiligo.\nThis cross sectional study was conducted in the Departments of Psychiatry and Dermatology, Ziauddin University, KDLB campus, Karachi and Institute of Surgery and Medicine, Karachi from April 2004 to March 2006. Clinically diagnosed cases of vitiligo, belonging to both sexes, aged above 15 years, fulfilling the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. The study was conducted in 2 stages. In the first stage, psychiatric illness was detected with the help of GHQ 12 (Urdu version), a validated tool for screening general population. In the second stage, \"Psychiatric Assessment Schedule\", Urdu version was administrated to every patient with high scores as per GHQ 12 to differentiate between the most frequent psychiatric disorders. All the findings were recorded, compiled and tabulated.\nA total of 100 patients comprising 62 females and 38 males ranging between 15-60 years with a mean age of 24.6 years completed the study. Exposed parts of the body were involved in 64 patients while covered sites in 36. Of the patients studied, 54 were married and 46 unmarried. In accordance with the GHQ-12 screening, 42 patients were positive for psychiatric caseness comprising 26 females and 16 males, 17 patients being married. Psychiatric caseness featured in patients below 30 years of age (28 patients) and those having exposed parts of the body being involved (27 patients). On evaluation with Psychiatric Assessment Schedule (PAS), major depressive illness (15), was the most frequent psychiatric illness followed by generalized anxiety (10), mixed anxiety and depression, social phobia, agarophobia and sexual dysfunction.\nPsychiatric caseness has a probable association with vitiligo, the frequency being influenced by variables of disease and life.

This article describes the reasons, advantages, and challenges of collaborative or shared care between primary and mental health teams, which are similar to those of consultation-liaison psychiatry. In both settings, clinicians deal with the complex interrelationships between medical and psychiatric disorders. Although initial models emphasized collaboration between family physicians, psychiatrists, and nurses, collaborative care has expanded to involve patients, psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists, pharmacists, and other providers. Several factors are associated with favorable patient outcomes. These include delivery of interventions in primary care settings by providers who have met face-to-face and/or have pre-existing clinical relationships. In the case of depression, good outcomes are particularly associated with approaches that combined collaborative care with treatment guidelines and systematic follow-up, especially for those with more severe illness. Family physicians with access to collaborative care also report greater knowledge, skills, and comfort in managing psychiatric disorders, even after controlling for possible confounders such as demographics and interest in psychiatry. Perceived medico-legal barriers to collaborative care can be addressed by adequate personal professional liability protection on the part of each practitioner, and ensuring that other health care professionals with whom they work collaboratively are similarly covered."}, {"Title": "[New biological properties of neuroleptic phenothiazines].", "Abstract": "Phenothiazines are the oldest and the largest group of neuroleptic drugs.

The stress-diathesis model suggests that psychiatric disorders have some genetic roots, and therefore the theory of evolution may be relevant for psychiatry. Schizophrenia is present in every human culture with approximately the same incidence. The great evolutionary paradox is: how can such illness persist despite fundamental reproductive disadvantages? Since the 1960s, several evolutionary explanations have been raised to explain the origins of schizophrenia. This article reviews all the major evolutionary theories about the possible origins of this disease. On the one hand, some researchers have proposed that schizophrenia is an evolutionary disadvantageous byproduct of human brain evolution (e.g. the evolution of hemispheric specialization, social brain or language skills). On the other hand, others have suggested that a compensatory advantage must exist either in the biological system of patients with schizophrenia (e.g. resistance against infectious diseases), or within the social domain (e.g. greater creativity of the relatives). According to some theories, shamanism and religion demonstrate some similarities to psychosis and provide clues regarding the origins of schizophrenia.

This problem is even more frequent in the early phase of psychotic disorders where prevalence of substance abuse ranges, according to various studies, from 35 to 65% during first psychotic episode. Cannabis is currently the most frequently used substance, and although its impact is often minimised, many data suggest it constitutes a risk for psychosis at three levels: (a) possible toxic psychosis in healthy individuals, (b) relapse of positive symptoms in schizophrenia and (c) raises the risk of schizophrenia when used early during adolescence. Despite a persistent controversy regarding some of these findings, they have constituted a sufficient body of evidence to support the development of specific interventions for psychotic patients. Various authors have described the fundamental elements of such dual diagnosis treatments, and some intervention programs have recently been developed. However, their relative complexity and the long duration of such interventions are often not well adapted to patients with limited motivation and low level of insight. Moreover, many obstacles arise that complicate their application to early psychotic disorders: minimisation of deleterious effect of cannabis by young people, distrust linked to psychotic symptoms, cognitive disturbances, stigmatisation of psychiatry, and use of cannabis as a means to socialise with peers. It is therefore important to adapt interventions to the specific needs of such patients and particularly to adopt a realistic attitude, aiming at increasing motivation to change habits and minimising associated risks rather than total abstinence. Our objective is to develop a pragmatic, non-judgemental approach, based on motivational interviewing techniques that is adapted to early psychosis with comorbid cannabis abuse, aimed at reducing the risks associated with abuse. In this article, we describe the basic principles and various stages of a brief motivational intervention developed for the treatment of cannabis abusers, going through the early phase of a psychotic disorder. The conceptualisation of the intervention was based on an extensive literature review and our experience in the treatment of such patients, as well as in the treatment of alcohol abuse through motivational interview.\nOur intervention uses motivational interviewing techniques (empathic, non-judgemental approach, aimed at developing insight regarding potential consequences of cannabis abuse through the exploration of both its positive and negative aspects) and can be adapted to the patient's stage of motivation for change. Its basic principles are: (a) to address questions related to psychosis and cannabis simultaneously; (b) to take into account cognitive dysfunction related to illness and treatment; (c) to adapt techniques of reflective listening; and (d) to structure the interview through frequent summaries and by considering successively the positive and negative aspects of cannabis. The intervention is composed of four sessions: (1) creation of an alliance and evaluation of the level of cannabis abuse; (2) development of motivation to change by increasing contradictions between patient's affirmations; (3) definition of objectives according to the level of motivation to change; and (4) adaptation of the subsequent intervention according to the degree of motivation to change.\nA pilot study showed that this intervention can be implemented in the target population. It revealed that it facilitated the establishment of a trustful relationship, in the frame of which ambivalence regarding cannabis abuse could be explored. The fact that the therapist makes the first step, shows empathy and tries to understand patient's motivations to use cannabis, leads patients to expose their ambivalence with less reluctance and to become more aware of the possible links between cannabis and psychotic disorders.\nThis method is particularly well adapted to patients who are in a precontemplative stage. Additional studies are needed in order to evaluate its efficacy in terms of decrease in the risks related to cannabis abuse."}, {"Title": "[Association between the intensity of childbirth pain and the intensity of postpartum blues].", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to highlight a link between childbirth pain and mood disorders in the immediate postpartum.\nWe met 43 women at three days postpartum in a maternity unit in Toulouse (France) between January and April 2004. The mean age of the mothers was 30 years (S.D., 4.8 years; range, 18-39 years). Mothers were excluded if they did not speak French, if they had past psychiatric history, and if their baby was premature, ill, or stillborn. Pain was measured using a French version of the McGill pain questionnaire (Melzack, 1975) [Br J Psychiatry 171 (1997) 550-555]. This questionnaire called questionnaire douleur Saint-Antoine (QDSA) is composed of 58 words and 16 classes (Boureau et at., 1984) [Th\u00e9rapie 39 (1984) 119-129]. Classes 1-9 provide data on the sensory qualities of pain while Classes 10-16 reflect affective characteristics. Blues symptoms was assessed with the French version of the maternity blues questionnaire of Kennerley and Gath (1989) [Br J Psychiatry 145 (1984) 620-625]. For each 28 items women have to decide how much change there is from their usual self, by ticking one choice out of five, from \"much less than usual\" to \"much more than usual\". We used the French version of the EPDS (Cox et al., 1987) [Br J Psychiatry 150 (1987) 782-786]. This scale was used to assess the intensity of depressive mood.\nThe results revealed a significant positive correlation between the pain scores and the \"maternity blues\" questionnaire scores, and between pain scores and EPDS score at three days postpartum. This study shows a stronger association between intensity of postpartum blues and affective aspect of childbirth pain (r=0.48; p<0.05) than between blues and sensorial aspect of pain (r=0.40; p<0.05). The level of depressive mood was found to be associated with affective (r=0.32; p<0.05) but not with sensory qualities of childbirth pain (r=0.28; p<0.05). In a multiple regression analysis predicting intensity of postpartum blues, we entered sensorial and affective scores of QDSA, age, and postpartum blues scores. The subjects to predictors ratio was adequate for multiple regression analysis as it was around the traditional guideline of at least ten participants per predictor [Howell DC. Statistical methods for psychology. Fourth ed. Duxbury press; 1997]. This model accounted for 31% of the variance of intensity of blues (F3,39=5.9, p=0.002). Affective dimension of pain was the only significant predictor (p=0.36, p=0.047). In another multiple regression analysis predicting intensity of depressive mood, we entered the same predictors. This model accounted for 20% of the variance of blues intensity (F3,39=3.26, p=0.03). Age was the only significant predictor (beta=-0.31, p=0.04). These results confirm our hypothesis that intensity of the childbirth pain is associated with mood disorders in the immediate postpartum. Several explications can be advanced. First, maternity blues could be a reaction to stress caused by childbirth pain. Moreover, pain can be felt as a failure for women who prepared themselves to a painless labor. Indeed, the prepared childbirth training pretends to give women the ability to overcome pain through physical and mental training. Thus, their responsibility in coping with the labor is heavy and might make them feel guilty if they fail. In addition, since \"the labor itself should be experienced as a positive moment\" [Chertock L. F\u00e9minit\u00e9 et maternit\u00e9: \u00e9tude clinique et exp\u00e9rimentale sur l'accouchement sans douleur. Paris: Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer; 1996], pain might be at the origin of a great disappointment [Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand 83 (2004) 57-61]. It should be noted that we used the QDSA as a measure of past pain and not as a measure of immediate pain, as Melzack recommended [Pain 1 (1975) 277-299].\nAccording to the results of this study, our hypothesis assuming a link between the intensity of labor pain and mood disorders in early postpartum appears to be confirmed. The intensity of postpartum blues is the best predictor of postnatal depression. Hence, knowledge of the risk factors, such as pain, could help to improve the efficiency of detection, and let professionals focus on the psychological impact of labor and especially on post-traumatic stress disorders."}, {"Title": "[A reply to Perron regarding the Inserm report \"Psychotherapy. The assessment of three approaches\"].", "Abstract": "The publication of the report by experts from Inserm (France) about the efficacy of psychotherapies (2004) has raised many criticisms, mainly from psychoanalysts. The criticisms of Perron, Brusset, Baruch and Emmanuelli, professors of psychology, published on Internet (www.techniques-psychotherapiques.org) in 2004, attack the methodology that they say introduced numerous biases in favour of cognitive behaviour therapies (CBT) compared to psychodynamic psychotherapies (PP). In order to argue against these criticisms, I have selected ten points raised by this group that seemed to represent the essence of their criticisms. Perron et al. say that the Inserm report is neither objective nor scientific; although this report cannot be fully objective due to its narrative nature, it is, nevertheless, based on empirical studies that satisfy scientific criteria for quality and that are well documented. * Perron et al. suggest that the Inserm report contains numerous biases; it is not possible to avoid all statistical biases so this criticism is an attack on accepted scientific methodology. * Perron et al. do not provide any evidence in favour of their criticism that the meta-analyses included in the report have accumulated biases due to prejudices common among psychotherapy researchers; even if researchers were all subject to therapy allegiance, this would not lead, systematically, to biases in favour of CBT. * Perron et al. state that meta-analyses automatically reinforce biases from randomised controlled trials (RCTs), whereas I argue that biases in RCTs are not systematically accumulated, and that the sensitivity of meta-analyses to doubtful RCTs can be tested by comparing results from analyses with and without these studies. * They also say that, in RCTs, the comparability between groups cannot be complete, however, the aim is not identity, and the comparability can be empirically tested after randomisation. * They also declare that the use of DSM automatically favours CBT, however, despite the fact that DSM is unsatisfactory even for biological psychiatrists and CBT therapists; no unanimously accepted alternative system has yet been identified. * Perron et al. say that the use of quantitative assessment of the psychotherapy outcome favours CBT because of an epistemological split between descriptive-nosological and functional-psychodynamic approaches. However such approaches are not clearly exclusive from each other, and a reduction of psychiatry into only two approaches does not fit with the observed variety of etiological hypotheses. * The statement that the functional-psychodynamic approach is contradictory with quantitative assessment of outcome is challenged by the fact that numerous outcome instruments for psychodynamic assessment exist. Furthermore, I have examined the size of the differences between CBT and PP, by selecting studies and meta-analyses that report the direct comparison of these therapies, but this does not provide evidence of major differences. Therefore, the existence of major bias in favour of CBT, due to either the use of DSM, symptom rating scales or other causes, is not supported by these facts. * The accusation that studies included in the Inserm report did not assess patients from control groups at endpoint has being found to be untrue. * The argument that the various effect size statistics used in the meta-analyses give rise to major bias is very unlikely. However, the authors overlooked the more important problem of pooling different outcome measures. * The allegation that a bias in favour of CBT was induced because there were more studies conducted with CBT than with PP is false, because the number of studies does not influence the effect-sizes. The Inserm report does, however, because of the presentation of results by DSM disorder and emphasis on absolute efficacy studies, find more positive results for CBT than for PP compared with no treatment. In conclusion, Perron's et al. criticisms are, in fact, against the application of scientific methodology to the assessment of the efficacy of psychotherapies as a whole. Nevertheless, the Inserm report has some weaknesses; the low number of studies of PP, the lack of direct comparisons between CBT and PP, the fact that multiple efficacy criteria were not taken into consideration, and the problem of comorbidities which was insufficiently taken into consideration."}, {"Title": "[Gilbert Ballet (1853 - 1916).

The most common psychosocial factors determining initiation and maintenance were peer pressure or curiosity.\nIf adolescents and youth can be motivated to stay away even from the \"gateway drugs\" by targeting common initiation factors, it may lead to delay in dependence or possibly avoidance of development of dependence."}, {"Title": "Management of emergencies in adults with congenital cardiac disease.", "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to assess the quantity and nature of emergencies affecting adults with congenital cardiac disease (CCD) and evaluate infrastructural requirements for adequate management. There is an increasing number of adults with CCD requiring specialized complex care. This multicenter study evaluated all emergency admissions to 1 of 5 centers for adults with CCD within 1 year. Within 1 year, there were 1,033 admissions of adults with CCD, and 201 (160 patients; age 16 to 71 years) were emergencies. Underlying cardiac anomalies were univentricular heart (22%), complete transposition (14%), tetralogy of Fallot (21%), and others (43%). Seventy percent of patients had undergone previous cardiac surgery. The main reason for acute admission was cardiovascular (arrhythmia, heart failure, syncope, aortic dissection, and endocarditis). Diagnostic procedures most often assigned were echocardiography (n = 223), chest x-ray (n = 95), Holter electrocardiography (n = 85), cardiac catheterization/electrophysiologic study (n = 39), and others (n = 143). Forty-six patients underwent surgery (cardiovascular n = 41, general n = 5) or electrophysiologic treatment (n = 41). One hundred twenty-six of 201 emergencies (63%) required cooperation with another specialized department: surgery (n = 46), internal medicine (n = 42), neurology (n = 12), ophthalmology (n = 6), otorhinolaryngology (n = 5), gynecology (n = 5), psychiatry (n = 4), radiology (n = 3), dermatology (n = 2), and orthopedics (n = 2). In conclusion, physicians and consultants attending adult patients with CCD need a high degree of specialized experience concerning the cardiac anomaly to manage emergencies properly. Furthermore, a wide range of noncardiac diagnostic and therapeutic procedures must be available. Data support the demand for a multidisciplinary approach in specialized centers for adequate care of adults with CCD."}, {"Title": "An Internet-based symptom questionnaire that is reliable, valid, and available to psychiatrists, neurologists, and psychologists.", "Abstract": "The Neuropsych Questionnaire (NPQ) addresses 2 important clinical issues: how to screen patients for a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders quickly and efficiently, and how to acquire independent verification of a patient's complaints. The NPQ is available over the Internet in adult and pediatric versions. The adult version of the NPQ consists of 207 simple questions about common symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. The NPQ scores patient and/or observer responses in terms of 20 symptom clusters: inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, learning problems, memory, anxiety, panic, agoraphobia, obsessions and compulsions, social anxiety, depression, mood instability, mania, aggression, psychosis, somatization, fatigue, sleep, suicide, pain, and substance abuse. The NPQ is reliable (patients tested twice, patient-observer pairs, 2 observers) and discriminates patients with different diagnoses. Scores generated by the NPQ correlate reasonably well with commonly used rating scales, and the test is sensitive to the effects of treatment. The NPQ is suitable for initial patient evaluations, and a short form is appropriate for follow-up assessment. The availability of a comprehensive computerized symptom checklist can help to make the day-to-day practice of psychiatry, neurology, and neuropsychology more objective."}, {"Title": "Clinical assessment in disaster mental health: a logic of case formulation.", "Abstract": "Despite increased professional attention to the mental health aspects of disaster medicine in recent years, advances in clinical assessment of survivors of mass casualty incidents have been few. Contemporary assessment methods often yield little more than check lists of symptoms that, while they may lead to reliable DSM-IV diagnoses, provide no sense of the individual patient's plight and so are inadequate for case formulation, treatment planning, and prognosis estimation. The authors describe a comprehensive model for assessing patients developed at the Johns Hopkins Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. Relating it to the field of disaster mental health for the first time here, the approach uses four distinct but overlapping appraisal perspectives, each of which drives a set of exploratory propositions and leads to an understanding of the essential natures of clinical disorders and their underlying etiologies. The perspectives address the following: (a) what the individual \"has\" (biologically based disease and physical illness); (b) who the individual \"is\" (graded dimensions of temperament, disposition, traits, intelligence, etc); (c) what the individual \"does\" (purposeful, goal-directed, conditioned behavior, etc); and (d) what the individual \"has encountered\" (his/ her life story and the meaning that has been given to those experiences). Following a description of each perspective from the standpoint of its underlying logic, inquiry domain, and indicated intervention, the authors highlight the potential hueristic value of the model by illustrating numerous testable hypotheses that can be generated through the juxtaposition of the four assessment perspectives with three longitudinal considerations for the management of trauma patients, ie, the stress-related constructs of (pre-incident) resistance, (peri-incident) resilience, and (post-incident) recovery."}, {"Title": "[Ethics, knowledge and psychiatry: in Aulus Cornelius Celsus' De Medicina].", "Abstract": "Modern medicine has many roots on greco-roman practice of the medical art.

The objectives of our survey were to point out the socio-cultural, clinical and psycho(patho)logical profile of the epileptic consulting in adult psychiatry, in Sfax teaching hospital, and to confront it to literature data coming from the studies dealing with the epileptic treated in neurological wards.\nIt was a retrospective survey assesing the epileptic whose first consultation occurred from the 1st January 1999 to 31st December 2003.\nThe studied sample included 197 cases. The sex-ratio (male/female) was 2.18. The rate of generalised seizures was 84.4%. The aetiology was known or presumed to be genetic in 48.2%. Sixty-nine per cent of the epileptics had mental disorders Our results and literature data showed that, compared with the epileptic treated in neurological wards, the consultants in psychiatry had epilepsy treated in a more classical way, more difficult to stabilise and frequently associated with mental disorders. By another way, we point out that in the area of our survey, although a department of neurology does exist, some epileptics without mental disorder are still addressed to psychiatrist, at least up to the period of the survey.\nAnyway, what seems to be more important is that the treatment should have realistic objectives.

The present study investigates the recognition of facial emotions in children and adolescents, 8-16 years old, with epilepsy. Twenty-nine subjects had TLE (13 right, 16 left) and eight had fronto-central epilepsy (FCE). Each was matched on age and gender with a control subject. Subjects were asked to label the emotions expressed in pictures of children's faces miming five basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust and anger) or neutrality (no emotion). All groups of children with epilepsy performed less well than controls. Patterns of impairment differed according to the topography of the epilepsy: the left-TLE (LTLE) group was impaired in recognizing fear and neutrality, the right-TLE (RTLE) group was impaired in recognizing disgust and, the FCE group was impaired in recognizing happiness. We clearly demonstrated that early seizure onset is associated with poor recognition of facial expression of emotion in TLE group, particularly for fear. Although right-TLE and left-TLE subjects were both impaired in the recognition of facial emotion, their psychosocial adjustment, as measured by the CBCL questionnaire [Achenbach, T. M. (1991). Manual for the Child Behavior Checklist and Youth Self-report. Burlington, VT: University of Vermont Department of Psychiatry], showed that poor recognition of fearful expressions was related to behavioral disorders only in children with right-TLE. Our study demonstrates for the first time that early-onset TLE can compromise the development of recognizing facial expressions of emotion in children and adolescents and suggests a link between impaired fear recognition and behavioral disorders."}, {"Title": "Translating findings from basic fear research to clinical psychiatry in Puerto Rico.", "Abstract": "Recent advances in the neuroscience of classical fear conditioning from both rodent and human studies are beginning to be translated to the psychiatry clinic.

The focus is on scientific development in the area of biological psychiatry, a branch of psychiatry dominated, during the second quarter of the 20th century, by Kretschmer's constitutional conceptions. These, however, could not be substantiated by the author's and his co-worker's extensive research using biometrical and statistical methods still rather unusual for German psychiatry at that time. In particular, the extent as well as kind of correlation between physique and personality and the differences in physical shape between patients with either schizophrenic or affective psychoses were invalidated. The latter could largely be explained by the age dependence of physique and type of psychosis. In the psychopharmacological phase of psychiatric development following that of constitutional biology, the focus of research moved to pharmacology and, in connection with it, to neurochemistry and neuroendocrinology. In this context, objectifying and quantifying techniques, also in the area of psychopathology, became more and more important for biological research in psychiatry. This is exemplified by selected investigations of ours at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich. Methodologically, this prepared the ground for the neurobiological phase of development induced by progress in neuroimaging and molecular genetics which marked the transition into the 21st century."}, {"Title": "Prevalence of clinically significant functional fatigue or weakness in specialty outpatient clinics of Pune, India.", "Abstract": "Disorders of fatigue are important in clinical practice but inadequately studied in developing countries. Questions about their consistency and variation across cultures also require attention. The standard professional diagnostic formulations of these disorders, namely, chronic fatigue syndrome and neurasthenia, are not used widely in India, perhaps due to lack of research and poor appreciation of their clinical significance. Recognising patients with clinically significant functional fatigue or weakness often seek help from various care-givers, prevalence of this condition was studied in four specialty clinics of Sassoon Hospital, Pune. An operationally defined set of criteria was used to create a screening instrument. Trained research assistants surveyed 1,874 consecutive patients from psychiatry, medicine, dermatology, and ayurved clinics. Data were entered and analysed to compute the rates of this condition, compare them across clinics and between sexes, and to compute rates adjusted for age, sex, and the clinic attended. Overall prevalence was 5.02% with higher rates in the dermatology and ayurved clinics than in psychiatry and medicine clinics. The female preponderance (63.83%) was notable (p < 0.001). Mean age of patients with this condition was similar across clinics. Logistic regression showed female sex (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.40) and dermatology clinic (OR 1.70, 1.02 to 2.85) to be significant predictors of CS-FoW. Female preponderance indicates the need for studies with gender focus. Clinical and cultural epidemiological studies informing psychiatrists as well as other physicians are necessary.

These youth groups were also compared with in- and outpatients from child and adolescent psychiatry, and a normal comparison group. In addition, we compared the symptom load of their mothers. Symptom load was measured by the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) in the adolescents, and by the Symptom Checklist 90 in their mothers. The results showed that youth in the MST and MTFC studies had a higher symptom load than in the FFT study, and the same pattern of results was found in their mothers. It is concluded that there seems to be a reasonable correspondence between the offered resources and the symptom load among youth and parents; treatment methods with higher intensity have been offered to youth with higher symptom load. The correlation between internalized and externalized symptoms was high in all study groups. The MST and MTFC groups had an equally high total symptom load as the psychiatric inpatient sample."}, {"Title": "Validity of the bereavement exclusion criterion for the diagnosis of major depressive episode.", "Abstract": "Since the publication of DSM-III in 1980, the official position of American psychiatry has been that the presence of bereavement is an exclusion criterion for the diagnosis of a major depressive episode (MDE). However, the empirical validity of this exclusion has not been well established. As DSM-V is now being planned, it is timely to reexamine the bereavement exclusion, particularly in the light of new evidence since the last reviews of this subject. This paper evaluates the relative validity of two competing hypotheses: 1) the bereavement exclusion for the diagnosis of MDE is not valid because, using validating criteria, bereavement related depression (BRD) within the first two months after the death of a loved one resembles non-bereavement related depression (SMD); 2) the bereavement exclusion for the diagnosis of MDD is valid because, using validating criteria, BRD within the first two months after the death of a loved one does not resemble SMD. The prevailing evidence more strongly supports Hypothesis 1 than Hypothesis 2. Thus, the bereavement exclusion for the diagnosis of MDE may no longer be justified."}, {"Title": "Rethinking psychosis: the disadvantages of a dichotomous classification now outweigh the advantages.", "Abstract": "Emil Kraepelin would clearly recognize his 19th century dichotomy within current operational classifications of psychosis. However, he might be surprised at its survival, given the extent to which it has been undermined by the weight of currently available empirical evidence. The failure of this evidence to influence diagnostic practice reflects not only the comfortable simplicity of the dichotomous approach, but also the fact that this approach has for many years continued to receive support from some areas of research, particularly genetic epidemiology. This, however, is changing and findings from genetic epidemiology are being reappraised. More importantly, the potential of molecular genetics to indicate biological systems involved in psychopathology has been recognized, and with it the potential to develop diagnostic classifications that have greater biological validity. Crucially, this will facilitate diagnostic schemes with much greater clinical utility, allowing clinicians to select treatments based on underlying pathogenesis. Recent molecular genetic findings have demonstrated very clearly the inadequacies of the dichotomous view, and highlighted the importance of better classifying cases with both psychotic and affective symptoms. In this article we discuss these issues and suggest ways forward, both immediately and for DSM-V and ICD-11.

While functional neuroimaging has served to blur this separation, many still consider the two mutually exclusive entities. But the study of migraine and limbic pain offers convincing evidence of Viktor Frankl's dichotomous model of the individual yet dependent spheres of psyche and soma. Chronic headache, though biomedical, wrestles with emotional issues, pharmacologic response, and other behavioral occurrences and conditions that confound the headache scientist. Similarly, research has shown that a vulnerable limbic system will perhaps amplify pain after years of sensitization caused by emotional trauma, loss, or abuse. These developments point to the need for a new model that embraces the approach of \"one brain, multiple manifestations.\" Only with a transformed understanding of the integrated psyche and soma can neuroscientists expect to truly understand human pathologies."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry and mental health in Morocco].", "Abstract": "Morocco has a population of some thirty million inhabitants, a very large proportion of whom are young.

We examined the disease forms and their geographical distribution.\nOur study involved 155 patients. The four major results are as follows: 1. In Hungary we detected only sporadic and genetic forms of human prion disease, while iatrogenic and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were not observed. 2. The proportion of genetic prion disease (E200K mutation), similarly to Slovakia, is higher than reported worldwide.

Similar rates of inconsistency were found in APS and ANZJP, and when comparing the ANZJP between 2000 and 2005. The percentages of articles with at least one inconsistency were 8.5% for ANZJP 2005, 9.9% for ANZJP 2000 and 12.1% for APS.

In this paper, various definitions of burnout are reviewed and the tools available for quantifying burnout are compared. The factors that make psychiatry a stressful profession are also examined. These include factors such as patient violence and suicide, limited resources, crowded inpatient wards, changing culture in mental health services, high work demands, poorly defined roles of consultants, responsibility without authority, inability to effect systemic change, conflict between responsibility toward employers vs. toward the patient, and isolation. In order to investigate how exposure to such stressors results in burnout, two theoretical models are examined.

The status of psychiatry as a medical discipline depends on a persuasive answer to this question. The answers tend to range from value accounts that see disorder as a sociopolitical concept, used for social control purposes, to scientific accounts that see the concept as strictly factual. I have proposed a hybrid account, the harmful dysfunction (HD) analysis, that incorporates both value and scientific components as essential elements of the medical concept of disorder, applying to both physical and mental conditions. According to the HD analysis, a condition is a disorder if it is negatively valued (\"harmful\") and it is in fact due to a failure of some internal mechanism to perform a function for which it was biologically designed (i.e., naturally selected). The implications of this analysis for the validity of symptom-based diagnostic criteria and for challenges in cross-cultural use of diagnostic criteria are explored, using a comparison of the application of DSM diagnostic criteria in the U.S. and Taiwan."}, {"Title": "Using publication statistics for evaluation in academic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The validity of using publication statistics to evaluate university faculty is not established.

The natural history of fecal incontinence is unknown, and the natural history of urinary incontinence over several years is not well described. (2) Fecal incontinence and urinary incontinence often have serious effects on the lives of the many individuals who suffer physical discomfort, embarrassment, stigma, and social isolation, and on family members, caregivers, and society. Financial costs are substantial and may be underestimated because of underreporting. (3) Routine episiotomy is the most easily preventable risk factor for fecal incontinence. Risk factors for both fecal and urinary incontinence include female sex, older age, and neurologic disease (including stroke). Increased body mass, decreased physical activity, depression, and diabetes may also increase risk. (4) Pelvic floor muscle training and biofeedback are effective in preventing and reversing fecal and urinary incontinence in women for the first year after giving birth, and these approaches may also prevent or reduce urinary incontinence in older women and in men undergoing prostate surgery. Fecal and urinary incontinence may be prevented by lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and exercise. (5) Efforts to raise public awareness of incontinence and the benefits of prevention and management should aim to eliminate stigma, promote disclosure and care-seeking, and reduce suffering. Organized approaches to improving clinical detection of fecal and urinary incontinence are needed and require rigorous evaluation. (6) To reduce the suffering and burden of fecal and urinary incontinence, research is needed to establish underlying mechanisms, describe a classification system, determine natural history, classify persons according to their future risk for fecal or urinary incontinence, design interventions targeted to specific population groups, determine the effects of these interventions, and guide public policy."}, {"Title": "Living in a Kraepelinian world: Kraepelin's impact on modern psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Kraepelin's works are made more accessible in English by the publication in 2002 of a 5-volume book of reprints of original translations.

Corresponding to the Kraepelinian dichotomy, those systems generally differentiated schizophrenia from affective psychosis. This paper examines the debate that took place between 1980 and 2000 regarding this differentiation. During the 1980s, the scientific reliability of the diagnostic criteria was challenged. In the 1990s there were significant critiques of the validity of the Kraepelinian dichotomy. Yet the dichotomy has not been formally abandoned, and the discussion continues to the present day.

Initially, Emil Kraepelin, the doyen of German psychiatry, and his students did not join in this discourse and only gradually developed their own ideas about homosexuality. The radicalization of German physicians in World War I led to a complete break between Hirschfeld and Kraepelinian psychiatry. But instead of developing his own theoretical model, Kraepelin adopted the arguments of his rival Alfred Hoche, who regarded homosexuality as a disease contracted through 'seduction'. Consequently, Kraepelin contributed to what, like the Nazis, he called 'popular sentiment', but neither he nor his followers influenced research on the aetiology and spread of homosexuality, and Kraepelin left no legacy in this field."}, {"Title": "Kraepelin's 'lost biological psychiatry'?

Dysthymic adolescents had a significantly higher level of support seeking than the patients suffering from conduct disorder. The variation seen in some parameters (autonomy and passive coping scales) of two samples of the internalizing disorder group and of externalizing one (behaviour disorder and adjustment disorder samples) was probably due to the differences among groups in the ratio of sex.\nCoping tests used in adult psychological studies are useful and confirm the occurrence of some typical mechanisms in adolescence too, but there exist strong need for more specific methods to identify adolescent coping qualities."}, {"Title": "Domain interplay concept in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders: a new strategy for high-throughput neurophenotyping research.", "Abstract": "Genetic and environmental factors play a key role in psychiatric disorders.

The primary objective was to compare incidence of treatment-emergent nausea at 30 mg q.a.m. versus 60 mg q.a.m. using item 112 (nausea) of the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry adverse event scale (AMDP-5). Secondary outcome measures included mean change on AMDP-5 item 112, discontinuations due to adverse events, mean changes in AMDP-5 items and subscales, spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse events, and vital signs. Efficacy was evaluated by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17).\nThe primary analysis, which combined data from both food groups, showed no significant difference in the incidence of nausea between starting doses of 30 mg q.a.m. and 60 mg q.a.m. (23% vs. 29%, respectively; p = .207). However, mean changes on the AMDP-5 nausea item revealed a significant main effect of food (p = .010) and a significant interaction between food and starting dose (p = .033). The food-by-dose interaction indicated that the benefit from taking drug with food was greatest in patients started at 60 mg q.a.m., and the benefit of starting at 30 mg q.a.m. was greatest in patients taking drug without food. In patients who took study drug without food, there was a significant difference across initial-dose groups for discontinuation due to adverse events (30 mg q.a.m. = 3.6%, 30 mg b.i.d. = 14.0%, 60 mg q.a.m. = 10.2%; 30 mg q.a.m. vs. 30 mg b.i.d., p = .008; 30 mg q.a.m. vs. 60 mg q.a.m., p = .066); however, in patients who took study drug with food, discontinuations due to adverse events did not significantly differ (30 mg q.a.m. = 5.4%, 30 mg b.i.d. = 7.5%, 60 mg q.a.m. = 7.4%; all p values > .50). Patients who started at 30 mg b.i.d. or 60 mg q.a.m. without food did not differ regarding mean changes (i.e., increases) in the common adverse events score after 1 week of treatment but had significantly greater mean changes than patients who started at 30 mg q.a.m. without food (0.87, 0.82, and 0, respectively; p < .05 vs. 30 mg b.i.d. and 60 mg q.a.m.). No significant differences were found between initial-dose groups in vital signs.\nThese data imply that starting dulox-etine at 30 mg q.a.m. for 1 week with or without food or starting duloxetine at the therapeutic dose of 60 mg q.a.m. with food can improve the initial tolerability of the medication. Adding this information to existing knowledge of duloxetine will enable the clinician to tailor therapy most appropriately for the individual patient.\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT 00191061."}, {"Title": "Hypoalgesia in schizophrenia is independent of antipsychotic drugs: a systematic quantitative review of experimental studies.", "Abstract": "Diminished sensitivity to pain in schizophrenia has been reported since the early works of Bleuler [Bleuler E.

A study was retained in the meta-analysis if: (i) it comprised a group of schizophrenia patients, compared to a control group of healthy volunteers; and (ii) pain was measured via experimental procedures (e.g. thermal, electrical, or mechanical stimuli). Using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis-2, effect size estimates of the differences in pain scores (all pain scores derived from all pain tests) between schizophrenia patients and healthy volunteers were calculated. Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis. For the composite analysis, a positive, moderate, and significant effect size estimate emerged (N=497; Hedges's g=0.437; p=0.005), suggesting that patients with schizophrenia show a diminished response to experimentally-induced pain. Secondary analyses showed that: (i) drug-free patients also have hypoalgesic responses; and that (ii) sensory thresholds are increased in schizophrenia patients. This meta-analysis substantiates the hypothesis of a diminished pain response in schizophrenia. The study also suggests that hypoalgesia in schizophrenia cannot be solely explained by the effects of antipsychotic drugs, and that it may not be a pain-specific blunted response.

The relative Uptake Values were further compared using SPSS 11.0.\nAn immediate increase followed by a decrease in cortical uptake was noted while the basal ganglia uptake remained high, albeit with a decreasing trend. Typical antipsychotics were associated with lower frontal cortical and higher basal ganglia and cerebellar uptake as compared to atypical antipsychotics.\nThe differential influence of the type and duration of antipsychotic on glucose uptake suggests a possible trend towards long-term side effects with typical medications that were not noted on clinical examination.

Patients acted as their own controls. Outcome measurement was the clinician-rated Childhood Global Assessment Scale (CGAS); researcher-rated health needs assessment; parent- and teacher-rated symptomatology.\nWe found a significant (p < .001) and clinically meaningful 12-point improvement in CGAS following mean 16.6 week admission (effect size .92); this improvement was sustained at 1 year follow-up. Comparatively, during the mean 16.4 week pre-admission period there was a 3.7-point improvement (effect size .27). Health needs assessment showed similar gain (p < .001, effect size 1.25), as did teacher- and parent-rated symptoms. Improvement was found across all diagnoses. Longer stays, positive therapeutic alliance and better premorbid family functioning independently predicted better outcome. Mean cost of admission was pound 24,100; pre-admission and post-discharge support costs were similar.\nInpatient treatment is associated with substantive sustained health gain across a range of diagnoses.

When no organic etiology was identified, a multidisciplinary approach using neurology, psychiatry, and physical medicine and rehabilitation services was applied. Neurophysiologic testing confirmed the absence of an organic disorder, and at this juncture, diagnostic efforts focused on identifying any psychiatric disorder to facilitate appropriate treatment for this individual. The final diagnosis was malingering.\nThe full psychiatric differential diagnosis should be considered in the evaluation of any patient with an atypical presentation of paralysis. A thorough clinical examination in combination with the appropriate diagnostic studies can confidently exclude an organic disorder. When considering a psychiatric disorder, the differential diagnosis should include conversion disorder and malingering, although each must remain a diagnosis of exclusion.

Psychiatric theories are discussed that (a) link psychiatric disorders to threat assessment and (b) explain how the normal functioning of threat assessment systems can become pathological. Three brain structures that are consistently implicated in psychiatric symptomology also are involved in threat assessment and self-defense: the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and parts of the so-called limbic system. We propose that as these structures evolved over time they formed what we refer to as evolutionary threat assessment systems, which detect and assess potential threats of harm. Drawing on various psychological and psychiatric theories we propose how beliefs about the world can moderate psychiatric symptoms through their influence on evolutionary threat assessment systems."}, {"Title": "The history of Lip\u00f3tmez\u00f6, the site of the first convulsive therapy.", "Abstract": "The National Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, better known as \"Lip\u00f3t,\" where convulsive therapy was first performed by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Meduna in 1934, is an important site in the history of biological psychiatry.

Diagnosis of depression, prescribing of antidepressant therapy, and referral for psychotherapy occur significantly less often in minority patients compared with whites. In the managed care setting, a number of issues at the physician level may negatively affect the quality of depression care, including attitudes toward psychiatry and mental health services, unfamiliarity with best practice guidelines for depression, and lack of cultural competency. On the other hand, a number of innovative approaches (eg, collaborative care) have demonstrated effectiveness in managed care settings.

In addition, these features suggest ways that production of even a small numbers of new neurons in the adult cortex could make a significant impact on neocortical function."}, {"Title": "Brain injury in a forensic psychiatry population.", "Abstract": "The prevalence and profile of adults with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) has not been studied in large North American forensic mental health populations.

The course was defined operationally using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS II) was administered to determine level of disability. Patients received follow-up assessments using the same instruments 3 months after receiving antidepressant treatment.\nFollow-up assessments showed that improvement in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale total scores was statistically significant, and lower anxiety and depression ratings were correlated with lower disability levels. The patients that had severe depression and anxiety at the beginning of the course had residual depressive symptoms. The results showed that severity of depression was a predictor of residual symptoms in our cohort. Psychological anxiety was the most common residual symptom (consistent with other studies) and the patients with a psychological anxiety score > or = 2 had higher disability levels (Z = -3.570, P < 0.05).\nSeverity of depression was a predictor of residual symptoms and partial remission after a depressive episode appeared to be strongly associated with disability. These findings highlight the importance of adequate treatment of depression."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatric background of social withdrawal in adolescence].", "Abstract": "In recent years, Japan's mental health welfare service personnel are encountering a growing number of adolescents in whom social withdrawal persists for extended periods. The provision of treatment and support for these individuals has become a challenge that needs to be addressed on a nationwide scale. This study was conducted to identify the guidelines for treating and assisting adolescents who manifest social withdrawal behaviors, and to clarify the psychiatrist's role. Of the consultation requests sent to the Yamanashi Prefectural Mental Health Welfare Center, cases of adolescents manifesting social withdrawal behaviors were classified into the following three groups and studied: (1) the Consultation Group (the subject himself/herself came to the center and made use of the consultation and assistance services), (2) the Non-Consultation Group (only the subject's family came to the center for consultation, and the staff were unable to meet him/her), and (3) the Consultation-after-Family Support Group (those subjects in the Consultation Group whom the staff could finally meet after one year or more of consultations with the family). As a result, we learned that adolescent cases of social withdrawal could be diagnosed and classified, in principle, according to the current diagnostic criteria (DSM-IV), and that, from here on, we aim to psychiatrically elucidate the pathology by focusing on international diagnostic criteria. We also showed that, compared with the Consultation Group, the Non-Consultation Group had a greater number of subjects with no employment history. The subjects within this group, moreover, tended to exhibit even more serious problems, and there was a possibility that the family structure and circumstances influenced whether or not the subjects visited the center for consultation. We also determined some of the issues related to assistance and support provided to individuals who fail to come to the center for consultation. Furthermore, we showed the possibility that psychiatry and psychiatrists play a wide variety of roles in dealing with the issue of social withdrawal in adolescence. These include: (a) cases in which a psychiatrist is called upon to provide diagnosis and treatment, (b) cases in which non-medical consultation service institutes play a central role in providing assistance in daily living and matters relating to employment, and a psychiatrist is called upon to provide adequate diagnosis and guidance, and (c) cases in which a psychiatrist collaborates and cooperates with private sector support groups."}, {"Title": "[Reconsideration of psychomotor seizure--importance of medio-dorsal thalmic nucleus].", "Abstract": "Recently, to my regret, the opportunities for psychiatrists to join in clinical and experimental activities to combat epilepsy are decreasing. In the period of 1960-1980, experimental epileptology was one of the main areas in the field of psychiatry. Now, I have been given an opportunity to reevaluate my paper, entitled \"Role of the Mediodorsal Thalamic Nucleus in Temporal Lobe Seizures--An Experimental Study\", published in this journal in 1968. Therefore, I would like to reconsider psychomotor seizures, which are classified as complex partial seizures at present. The psychomotor seizures mentioned above are so-called amygdalo hippocampal seizures. At first, I was very much interested in the amygdala and hippocampus, because these seizures are quite similar to psychomotor seizures which are clinically observed in epileptics. I observed a lot of important phenomena. A amygdaloid and hippocampal seizures are quite different from each other, both regarding their behavior and EEG findings which are observed during the attacks. Hippocampal seizures consisted of staring in the arrest reaction. On the contrary, amygdaloid seizures showed typical automatisms, such as facial and behavioral automatisms. From these results, it was considered that the clinically observed psychomotor seizures began in the hippocampus and immediately induced the self-sustained amygdaloid seizures. In my experiments, I often observed that self-sustained amygdaloid seizures were easily induced by hippocampal seizures. Moreover, I noted the fact that stimulation of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus elicited both amygdaloid and hippocampal seizures. By means of stimulation and surgical interruption methods among the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus, amygdala, and hippocampus, I found that the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus plays the main role in amygdalo-hippocampal seizures. According to my experiments, the thalamic nucleus controls the limbic seizures. So, I concluded that the therapeutic approach to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus is clinically very important. I think that, through these experimental studies, I could profoundly understand epilepsy itself and the development of seizure discharge in the brain, and put this understanding to good use in my clinical activities. It is my belief that experiments which are performed by clinicians field useful results which can be utilized clinically."}, {"Title": "Use of medication in children with psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "This article looks at the most common drugs that are in use in child psychiatry, and discusses their main indications for use and possible side effects."}, {"Title": "Causes of schizophrenia reported by urban African American lay community members.", "Abstract": "Although mental health professionals' \"etiologic beliefs\" concerning schizophrenia have evolved in accordance with diathesis-stress and neurodevelopmental models, little is known about etiologic attributions in nonclinical general population samples in the United States. Yet, course and outcome for people with the illness may be indirectly influenced by beliefs about causes in the larger community. Because of very limited research in this area, especially among African Americans in particular, this descriptive study investigated the causes of schizophrenia reported by 127 urban African Americans from the general population. The aim of this study was to assess the most commonly reported causes of schizophrenia, as well as the frequency of endorsing items from a list of 30 factors, some of which are congruent with current psychiatric conceptualizations of schizophrenia, whereas others are not. Results of this report complement previously reported findings from the same setting involving family members of patients with schizophrenia [Esterberg ML, Compton MT. Causes of schizophrenia reported by family members of urban African American hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. Compr Psychiatry 2006;47:221-226]. The 5 most commonly reported causes were disturbance of brain biochemistry (49.6%), drug/alcohol abuse (42.5%), hereditary factors (40.9%), brain injury (40.2%), and avoidance of problems in life (37.8%). The mean number of likely or very likely causes endorsed by participants was 7.5 +/- 5.7. Some 47.9% reported one or more esoteric factors as a cause. Of the 6 esoteric factors, possession by evil spirits (28.3%), radiation (20.2%), and punishment by God (19.7%) were most common. Esoteric causes were more commonly chosen by male participants, those with 12 years of education or less, and participants who reported never having known someone with schizophrenia. Future research should seek to better understand how esoteric beliefs about causation affect attitudes toward people with mental illnesses and acceptance of mental health treatment by those individuals. Beliefs about debunked personality, societal, family, and esoteric causes in this nonclinical sample indicate the need for improved psychoeducation of the community at large."}, {"Title": "[Work features of the psychologist in the primary health care centers of the public health care system in Chile].", "Abstract": "To define work characteristics of psychologists in public primary health care centers in Chile and the degree to which their functions conform to the standards set by the National Plan on Mental Health and Psychiatry (NPMHP).\nFrom December 2003 to November 2004, a cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted employing a questionnaire sent to a nonrandom sample of 486 professionals working in public primary care centers of Chile's 29 health districts. The total response rate was 34.4% (167 completed questionnaires). The questionnaire gathered general information and demographics; frequency, distribution, and type of activities performed; the mental health issues treated; personal perspectives on the efficiency of care, factors affecting interventions, and the quality of work conditions; and competence level regarding diagnosis and treatment strategies, as well as the educational background needed to fulfill the role of psychologist at the primary health care centers. Descriptive statistics with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the quantitative data. Content analysis techniques were applied to the responses to open-ended questions.\nConsiderably more time is being devoted to individual consultations and interventions than to group and community promotion and prevention activities. Over 93% of the survey participants were satisfied with their work and valued their peers; however, more than half gave a negative rating to their work conditions and job security.

In a multidisciplinary effort to address this problem, clinicians and basic scientists with expertise in areas of inflammation, psychiatry, neurosciences and psychoneuroimmunology were brought together in a specialized meeting organized in Bordeaux, France, on May 28-29, 2007. These experts considered key questions in the field, in particular those related to identification and quantification of the predominant symptoms associated with inflammation, definition of systemic and central markers of inflammation, possible domains of intervention for controlling inflammation-associated symptoms, and relevance of animal models of inflammation-associated symptoms.

This paper aims to distinguish between supposed idiographic and narrative judgement. Taking the former to mean a kind of individualised judgement, I argue that it has no place in psychiatry in part because it threatens psychiatric validity. Narrative judgement, by contrast, is a genuinely distinct complement to criteriological diagnosis but it is, nevertheless, a special kind of general judgement and thus can possess validity. To argue this I first examine the origin of the distinction between idiographic and nomothetic in Windelband's 1894 rectorial address. I argue that none of three ways of understanding that distinction is tenable. Windelband's description of historical methods, as a practical example, does not articulate a genuine form of understanding. A metaphysical distinction between particulars and general kinds is guilty of subscribing to the Myth of the Given. A distinction based on an abstraction of essentially combined aspects of empirical judgement cannot underpin a distinct empirical method. Furthermore, idiographic elements understood as individualised judgements threaten the validity of psychiatric diagnosis. In the final part I briefly describe some aspects of the logic of narrative judgements and argue that in the call for comprehensive diagnosis, narrative rather than idiographic elements have an important role. Importantly, however, whilst directed towards individual subjects, narratives are framed in intrinsically general concepts and thus can aspire to validity."}, {"Title": "[Special observation on psychiatric patients on acute inpatient wards at the Division of Psychiatry, Landsp\u00edtali-University Hospital in Iceland, attitudes of patients and staff].", "Abstract": "Special observation (constant observation) of patients is common on psychiatric wards, both in Iceland and abroad, but very few studies have been conducted on their therapeutic value. The objective was to investigate the extent and nature of special observation on emergency wards at the division of psychiatry at the Landspitali-University Hospital in Iceland as well as the attitudes of patients and staff toward special observation.\nInformation about patients on special observation was recorded over a three months period. Patients were interviewed with a standardised eleven questions interview shortly after the observation finished in order to investigate their attitudes toward the observation. Also, members of staff from each ward were asked to answer eight questions about their attitudes toward special observation in general. The Ethics Committee of Landspitali - University Hospital gave its permission for the study.\nDuring the research period observation was used for 157 patients, which is 31% of the total number of patients admitted during that period. Most of the patients (83%) were on 5-15 minutes observation, 25 per cent on close observation and 11 percent on suicide or constant observation. The majority of the patients claimed that security was the most important aspect of being on special observation, independent of which type of observation they were, and only one fifth felt that the company of staff was most important. The staff members on the other hand claimed that concern for the patient, respect and companionship were most important for the patients, independent of the type of observation used.\nThe extent, nature and process of observation on acute inpatient wards in Iceland seems to be comparable to other studies from abroad.

We reviewed the literature to identify potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications of TMS in child neurology and also its safety in pediatrics. Although TMS has not been associated with any serious side effects in children and appears to be well tolerated, general safety guidelines should be established. The potential for applications of TMS in child neurology and psychiatry is significant.

From 1864, the building of new asylums was the responsibility of Crown land governments, which by the end of the nineteenth century had emerged as sites of power and self-presentation by minority groups and new political parties. At the same time, the area of asylum planning was establishing itself as a branch of asylum psychiatry and promoting the idea of the asylum as model settlement, contributing to social reform. I analyse the interaction of psychiatrists, architects and government officials involved in planning the two institutions in the context of Crown land governments' self-positioning within the empire and internationally (especially in relation to Italy and Germany). The Trieste asylum planners were working for a government controlled by Italian nationalists, but their desire for a 'modern' asylum turned them towards German models. The Christian Social government in Lower Austria sought to supplant Germany as the leader in this branch of science. The spatial arrangement and visual articulation of the two asylums is interpreted in the context of the interaction of psychiatry and the politics of regional autonomy."}, {"Title": "Dhis and Dh\u0101t: Evidence of Semen Retention Syndrome Amongst White Britons.", "Abstract": "The uncritical application of western psychiatric concepts in non-western societies resulting in culturally invalid psychiatric syndromes, have been extensively documented. Such instances are considered 'category errors'. In contrast, 'reverse category errors' although theoretically postulated, have never been empirically demonstrated. Diagnostic criteria of an established South Asian culture specific neurosis, Dh\u0101t syndrome, were deployed by a psychiatrist of South Asian origin, amongst 47 white Britons in London, UK, presenting for the first time with a clinic diagnosis of ICD-9 Depressive Neurosis (Dysthymic Disroder, ICD-11). The proceedure yielded a new disorder, Semen Retention Syndrome. Based on narrative accounts and quantitative scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the evidence suggests that a significant subset of white British subjects diagnosed with Dysthymic Disorder, may in fact be expressing a psychological variation of a previously unknown local White British somatisation phenomena labelled Semen Retention Syndrome. Anxiety and depressive symptoms presented by this subset of subjects were primarily attributed to a core irrational belief and a cognitive error centered around misunderstood concepts of semen physiology. Consequently, the undue focus on mood idioms by both white British patients and their health professionals, leads to a mistaken diagnosis of Mood Disorder, and results in incorrect treatment. The implications of this ethnocentric mode of reasoning raises concerns about existing concepts in psychiatric phenomenology and for official international diagnostic classificatory systems. The paper concludes by arguing that category errors in both directions are instances of cultural iatrogenesis, and underscore the importance of a culturally valid psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Brief Supportive Psychotherapy for a Patient with Chronic Schizophrenia Who is Dying.", "Abstract": "Psychiatrists can offer much in the care of the person who is chronically mentally ill and who is dying of a medical illness.

The subjects of this study were 483 consecutive patients with cancer who had been referred to the Department of Psychiatry in Kanagawa Prefecture Cancer Center from February 1, 2004, to November 30, 2005. Trained psychiatrists conducted a nonstructured psychiatric interview and neurologic examination to establish psychiatric diagnoses according to DSM-IV and the presence or absence of drug-induced extra pyramidal symptoms. The past and current medications used in their cancer treatment were also examined in detail for an accurate evaluation.\nA psychiatric diagnosis was made in 420 (87.0%) of the 483 cancer patients examined, and akathisia, a drug-induced movement disorder, was unexpectedly prevalent among the patients; 20 of 420 (4.8%) patients had developed akathisia from an antiemetic drug, prochlorperazine.\nDiagnosing such adverse drug reactions may be difficult due to complicating factors in cancer treatment, and the inner restlessness observed in akathisia is likely to be regarded as a symptom of a primary psychiatric disorder. The authors suggest that oncologists should optimize the use of antiemetic drugs and be aware of akathisia as a possible complication of cancer treatment."}, {"Title": "Malondialdehyde levels in adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "To evaluate the biochemical basis of adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (A-ADHD), we compared lipid peroxidation status in the plasma of A-ADHD patients, and that of control subjects without A-ADHD by quantifying the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), an end product of fatty acid oxidation.

An analysis on psychotherapeutic treatments in German journals].", "Abstract": "In the current discussion on optimizing psychotherapeutic approaches, two important developments have to be considered: a tendency towards integrative and a tendency towards disorder specific approaches. For the years 2005 and 2006, an analysis of three German journals (covering the fields of psychosomatics, psychiatry and clinical psychology) was conducted on the question whether these two developments can be identified in current empirical and conceptual publications. Contrary to the expectations, there are only very few papers dealing with integrative approaches. As expected, there is a major emphasis on psychodynamic and cognitive behavioural approaches; other approaches are only marginally considered. A disorder specific approach can be identified not only for cognitive behavioural, but also for psychodynamic papers."}, {"Title": "First do no harm: an analysis of the risk aspects and side effects of clinical holistic medicine compared with standard psychiatric biomedical treatment.", "Abstract": "Clinical holistic medicine (CHM) is short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) complemented with bodywork and philosophical exercises, to be more efficient in treating patients with severe mental and physical illness. STPP has already been found superior to psychiatric treatment as usual (TAU) and thus able to compete with psychiatric standard treatment as the treatment of choice for all non-organic mental illnesses; we have found the addition of bodywork and philosophy of life to STPP to accelerate the process of existential healing and recovery (salutogenesis). In this paper we compare the side effects, suicidal risk, problems from implanted memory and implanted philosophy of CHM with psychopharmacological treatment.\nQualitative and quantitative comparative review.\nIn all aspects of risks, harmfulness, and side effects, we have been considering, CHM was superior to the standard psychiatric treatment. The old principle of \"first do no harm\" is well respected by CHM, but not always by standard psychiatry. CHM seems to be able to heal the patient, while psychopharmacological drugs can turn the patient into a chronic, mentally ill patient for life. Based on the available data CHM seems another alternative to patients with mental illness. There seem to be no documentation at all for CHM being dangerous, harmful, having side effects of putting patients at risk for suicide. As CHM uses spontaneous regression there is no danger for the patient developing psychosis as, according to some experts, has been seen with earlier intensive psychodynamic methods. CHM is an efficient, safe and affordable cure for a broad range of mental illnesses."}, {"Title": "Nursing of young psychotic patients: analysis of work environments and attitudes.", "Abstract": "Being members of the team who spend most of their time in direct contact with patient, nurses contribute considerably to observational and inpatient treatment process. The aims of this study were to analyse working environment of psychiatric nurses, attitudes, needs and emotional aspects while working with young (15-35 years old) psychotic patients. Study population consisted of psychiatric nurses working in all 15 inpatient psychiatry units in Vilnius. Nurses filled in an anonymous questionnaire. Summary statistics using number of observations, mean and SD were reported for quantitative variables, with absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables. Questionnaires were filled by 86 nurses. The mean working experience was 17 years in nursing and 14 years in psychiatric nursing. Data analysis revealed that majority of nurses rated their satisfaction with their job between average and high. Results showed that there was a lack of in-service training programmes. What especially difficult was nursing of young psychotic patients and required good professional knowledge, experience and individual approach to each patient. Majority of nurses were fully satisfied with their job and were interested in further continuous self-education. The major concern in working with young psychotic patients was reassurance of personal and patient's safety."}, {"Title": "Use of the HoNOSCA scale in the teamwork of inpatient child psychiatry unit.", "Abstract": "The aims of this study were to introduce the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA) into the clinical practice, to assess the possibilities to use HoNOSCA in the interdisciplinary teamwork of child psychiatric inpatient unit and to analyse differences in evaluation of HoNOSCA among team members scoring different diagnostic groups of children. HoNOSCA was translated into Lithuanian and team members were trained to use the scale. Inter-rater reliabilities between various pairs of specialists and between all members of the team were calculated using intraclass correlations calculated for each item of the scale and total score. Scoring differences in children with externalized and internalized disorders between psychiatrists-psychologists versus nurses-caretakers were analysed using t-test. The analysis showed that intraclass correlations estimates of reliability of the HoNOSCA discharge scores were highest for ratings by child psychiatrists-psychologists and nurses-caretakers. Analysis of ratings of patients with externalized and internalized disorders types showed differences in scoring disruptive/aggressive behaviours, self-care and family relationship scales. HoNOSCA had satisfactory inter-rater reliability in clinical multidisciplinary practice of child psychiatric inpatient unit. Implementing HoNOSCA in routine clinical practice and analysis of the rating differences among the multidisciplinary team members was useful to highlight possibilities for improvement of quality of services provided and building more constructive teamwork."}, {"Title": "Clinical staging: a heuristic model for psychiatry and youth mental health.", "Abstract": "Diagnosis in psychiatry continues to struggle to fulfil its key purposes, namely to guide treatment and to predict outcome. A clinical staging model, widely used in clinical medicine, could improve the utility of diagnosis in psychiatry, especially in young people with emerging disorders. Clinical staging has immediate potential to improve the logic and timing of interventions in psychiatry, as it does in many complex and potentially serious medical disorders. Interventions could be evaluated in terms of their ability to prevent or delay progression from earlier to later stages of a disorder, and selected by consumers and clinicians on the basis of clear-cut risk-benefit criteria. This would ensure that, as treatments are offered earlier, they remain safe, acceptable and affordable, and potentially more effective. Biological variables and a range of candidate risk and protective factors could be studied within and across stages, and their role, specificity and centrality in risk, onset and progression of disorders clarified. In this way, a clinicopathological framework could be progressively constructed. Clinical staging, with restructuring across and within diagnostic boundaries and explicit operational criteria for extent and progression of disorder, should be actively explored in psychiatry as a heuristic strategy for developing and evaluating earlier, safer, and more effective clinical interventions, and for clarifying the biological basis of psychiatric disorders. Young people with emerging mental and substance use disorders could be the main beneficiaries."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric epidemiology in India.", "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies report prevalence rates for psychiatric disorders from 9.5 to 370/1000 populations in India.

Retrieved articles were systematically selected using inclusion and exclusion criteria. Only sixteen prevalence studies fulfilled the study criteria. Most of the epidemiological studies done in India neglected anxiety disorders, substance dependence disorders, co-morbidity and dual diagnosis. The use of poor sensitive screening instruments, single informant and systematic underreporting has added to the discrepancy in the prevalence rate. The prevalence of mental disorders reported in epidemiological surveys can be considered lower estimates rather than accurate reflections of the true prevalence in the population. Researchers have focused on broad non-specific, non-modifiable risk factors, such as age, gender and social class.

Acute spinal cord injury (SCI) is an event with devastating consequences, and no satisfactory treatment is available at present. The pathogenetic mechanisms associated with SCI include excitotoxicity, increased oxidation and inflammation. We review here our recent studies, which suggest that omega-3 PUFA have significant neuroprotective potential in spinal cord trauma. In a first study, we administered an intravenous bolus of alpha-linolenic acid (LNA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 30 min after spinal cord hemisection injury in adult rats. The omega-3 PUFA led to increased neuronal and glial survival, and a significantly improved neurological outcome. In subsequent studies, we tested DHA in a more severe compression model of SCI. We also explored a combined acute and chronic treatment regime using DHA. Saline or DHA was administered intravenously 30 min after compression of the spinal cord. After injury, the saline group received a standard control diet, whereas DHA-injected animals received either a control or a DHA-enriched diet for 6 weeks following injury. We assessed locomotor recovery and analysed markers for cell survival and axonal damage, and we also investigated the effects of the treatment on the inflammatory reaction and the oxidative stress that follow SCI. We showed that the acute DHA treatment is neuroprotective after compression SCI, even if the treatment is delayed up to an hour after injury. The DHA injection led to an increased neuronal and glial cell survival, and the effect of the DHA injection was amplified by addition of DHA to the diet. Rats treated with a DHA injection and a DHA-enriched diet performed significantly better at 6 weeks in terms of neurological outcome. The analysis of the tissue after DHA administration showed that the fatty acid significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and RNA/DNA oxidation, and the induction of COX-2. Parallel studies in a facial nerve injury model in mice also showed pro-regenerative effects of chronic dietary administration of DHA after nerve lesion. These observations suggest that treatment with omega-3 PUFA could represent a promising therapeutic approach in the management of neurological injury."}, {"Title": "Schizophrenia, psychiatric genetics, and Darwinian psychiatry: an evolutionary framework.", "Abstract": "The evolutionary origins of one of the most dramatic and seemingly deleterious behavioral phenotypes, the syndrome known as schizophrenia, are mysterious. Schizophrenia occurs in all cultures and is inherited. Although most phenotypes are said to be \"selected for\" based on adaptive qualities, it is difficult to understand how the genetic basis of schizophrenia could have operated under a similar framework. This has lead several theorists analyzing the proposed evolutionary origins of other disease states to that of schizophrenia. To date, several models have been applied. We have tried to conceptualize schizophrenia in a compensatory advantage framework whereby incomplete penetrance of the full disorder, or alternatively, the inheritance of risk alleles insufficient in number to manifest as the classic clinical syndrome, may manifest as a behavioral phenotype with adaptive advantages (eg, creative behavior or novel illuminating ideas). The idea that even full penetrance can also be advantageous has been offered as applied to religious experience and ancient social standing, but is unlikely. Can complex behavioral phenotypes such as schizophrenia, and particularly those that seem purely deleterious, be explained by mechanisms of Darwinian psychiatry? Can models from other disease classes be applied successfully to schizophrenia? Such ideas have generated intense speculation, but often in the absence of testable models. In this article, we will examine some of these proposed ideas and offer suggestions for future research."}, {"Title": "[Emil Kraepelin: a pioneer of modern psychiatry. On the occasion of the hundred and fiftieth anniversary of his birth].", "Abstract": "Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) whose hundred and fiftieth birth anniversary we are celebrating this year, is one of the most renowned figures of psychiatry. His Memoirs published in 1983 provide insight on the individual. In his early career he lived in W\u00fcrzburg, Munich, Leipzig, Leubus, Dresden, and then in Dorpat in 1886 (as visiting professor) where he stayed for five years, in Heidelberg (as regular professor) from 1891 to 1904, and lastly in Munich. Kraepelin ranks among the great clinical medicine forerunners who followed in Kahlbaum's footsteps. For him, the foremost task of scientific psychiatry was to circumscribe pathological entities. At the foundation of Kraepelin-inspired scientific psychiatry lies the notion of the <<clinical study>> of disease, as opposed to the <<symptomatic>> approach (5th edition of the Treatise), whereby it is no longer concerned with the study of mental disorder in terms of symptoms but rather in terms of conditions of occurrence, evolution and outcome thereof. This method produced two well-known results: the unification and recognition of <<manic-depressive insanity>>, and the definition of <<early-onset dementia>> (dementia praecox). These results are described in the Treatise of Psychiatry which has had eight editions during the author's lifetime (from 1883 to 1915), and which presents Kraepelin's systematic nosography covering the entire field of mental illness. Such an innovative method required special tools capable of exploring not only the symptoms, as had been done previously, but the pathological process per se: therefore, Kreapelin created a systematic method to conduct psychiatric research and founded a Research Establishment divided into different sections (histopathology, topographic histology, serology, genealogy). Alois Alzheimer and Franz Nissl, among others, were closely associated with his work. Kreapelin's thought was not set, however, and by the end of his career it took a turn toward a more comprehensive type of psychiatry (1920) taking into account the social aspects (<<social psychiatry>>). From the therapeutic and institutional viewpoints, Kraepelin remained faithful throughout his life to the no-restraint practice by abolishing any restraint methods wherever he worked; by establishing a trust-based relationship with the patients; by allowing the patients to correspond and by opening the institution to visitors. Additionally, he participated actively in the struggle against alcoholism and syphilis. He is also one of the initiators of cross-cultural psychiatry (<<comparative psychiatry>>). Although he lead a medical career, Kraepelin was also interested in experimental psychology, and he thought of his works in that area as more important than his clinical achievements. He was closely connected with Wilhelm Wundt with whom he worked (at the Institute of Psychology of Leipzig where Kraepelin was one of the first medical doctors to collaborate with Wundt) and then exchanged letters. Some of his experimental works, including the elaboration of series of tests aimed at studying the psychic effects of certain substances, herald the advent of psychopharmacology. Lastly, his Memoirs and Poems give insight on the intimate person of Kraepelin, as well as putting his affective life in perspective."}, {"Title": "[Recurrences of bipolar disorders - comparative study of bipolar disorders, recurring depressions and single depressions in a cohort of patients aged over 65 years].", "Abstract": "Bipolar mood disorders, after starting at adulthood, may remain active throughout life, but bipolar disorders may only be revealed in later life. Indeed, Yet few data on bipolar disorders in the elderly have been reported in the litterature. The influence of normal aging on the outcome of the disease as well as the specific prognosis of bipolar disorders in the elderly has occasionally been studied. Eventually Finally, and contrasting with adults, few studies comparing the various subtypes of mood disorders were have been performed in the elderly.\nWe therefore developed a study in patients aged 65 or above, in order to evaluate the course (recurrences) of bipolar disorders, compared to recurring depressions and single depressions, and to determine the influence of recurrences on the outcome of bipolar disorders.\nPatients aged over 65 years were inpatients admitted to the department of psychiatry in 2000 for one of the three previously mentioned diagnoses according to DSM IV. Retrospective data were collected from medical reports. Prospectively, data were collected from the general practitioner of each patient (relying on telephone calls), before statistical analysis was performed.\nOur study demonstrates a more severe outcome for bipolar disorders compared to recurring depressions and single depressions. Patients with bipolar disorders have a higher prevalence of psychiatric recurrences. Furthermore, the greater the number of previous relapses (or the longer the duration and intensity of the disease), the higher the risk of future new future recurrences both in bipolar disorders and recurring depressions. An age of onset of bipolar disorders before 60 years and more than 5 in-hospital admissions increase the risk of recurrences.\nWe originally compare the outcome of bipolar disorders in the elderly, to recurring depressions and single depressions. We confirm the fatal outcome of recurrences in bipolar disorders in old age. Bipolar disorders in the elderly should be considered as a real public health care problem: strategies to minimize the number of episodes experienced by patients with bipolar illness must be pursued aggressively throughout life."}, {"Title": "Enhancing patient safety in psychiatric settings.", "Abstract": "There is growing national consensus that use of institutional measures of control, such as seclusion, restraint, enforced medications, and hand-cuffed transport, within psychiatric hospitals is all too common and is potentially counter-therapeutic.

Key search terms included seclusion, restraint, reduc*, psychiatric patient safety, psychiatric safety, psychiatric sanctuary, and quality of care psychiatry.\nOnly very limited data are available on reducing measures of last resort and improving the safety of psychiatric settings, and virtually no controlled data are available concerning the effectiveness of specific behavioral efforts on subsequent reduction of seclusion and restraint events.

Although the clinical literature favors a \"serotonin hypothesis\" for depression, a growing basic science literature suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) directly modulate neurotransmitter- and voltage-gated neuronal ion channels. In addition, biosynthesis of neurosteroids (themselves promiscuous ion channel modulators), is activated by SSRIs. These non-canonical effects are entirely independent of serotonin signaling, and they occur in the range of SSRI concentrations reported in the brains of treated patients (1-10 microM). The protean impact of these diverse channel targets on neuronal excitability raises interesting and potentially testable hypotheses about depression pathophysiology and treatment. Specifically, emerging network theories are embracing the non-linearity and complexity of brain circuitry and its oscillatory behavior, with clinical correlations in psychiatry and neurology. Is it possible that certain brain dysfunction (such as depression) may be more amenable to a poly-pharmacy approach? The promiscuity of SSRIs suggests that such poly-pharmacy can emerge from a single agent."}, {"Title": "[Prevalence of dementia or other form of organic brain disorder on a geriatric psychiatry ward].", "Abstract": "The prevalence of dementia in various geriatric psychiatry settings has previously been investigated and been found to lie between 15.2% and 61%.

In addition to bipolar II disorder, the patient had been previously diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer's disease, posttraumatic stress disorder, and various anxiety disorders. During the current hospitalization, she was taking clonazepam, dextroamphetamine, lamotrigine, lansoprazole, levothyroxine, memantine, quetiapine, risperidone, rivastigmine, tranylcypromine, trazodone, and zolpidem. Soon after hospital admission, she began to complain of a tightening in her chest. A review of her records revealed similar complaints during previous hospitalizations. Rivastigmine was discontinued due to concerns of interactions with her antipsychotic regimen. Although these symptoms were previously attributed to anxiety, they appeared worse during this hospitalization. During these events she would be witnessed lying in bed in a supine position with her head canted posteriorly. Benztropine was given to help determine if she was having a dystonic reaction. Within 30 minutes, her chest discomfort began to resolve, and her symptoms resolved completely over the next 48 hours. Three days later, rivastigmine was restarted by the attending psychiatrist because of concerns about the patient's memory, and the dystonia-like symptoms returned within 2 hours of her morning dose. Rivastigmine was discontinued, and benztropine was given and then discontinued, with no return of symptoms for the remainder of her two-week hospitalization.\nA patient with bipolar II disorder and mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease developed dystonia, possibly caused by rivastigmine.

We anticipate that clinical use of neuroimaging modalities in psychiatry will increase dramatically in the near future and suggest that clinicians need to be aware of the potential applications.\nThe authors conducted an extensive MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMED and PsychInfo search of the published literature (1965-2007) using a variety of search terms to find relevant articles. Bibliographies of retrieved papers were further scrutinised for publications of interest, as were indices of books. Articles that reported clinically significant findings and research reports conducted using pertinent neuroimaging modalities were reviewed in detail.\nThe review suggests that exciting neuroimaging advances are being made that have relevance to psychiatry. Novel neuroimaging applications with potential clinical utility are rapidly emerging and the accessibility and use of these technologies will increase in coming years. Clinically meaningful findings have begun to emerge in mood disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia and dementia. Coupling multimodal imaging with genetics and pharmacotherapeutic studies will further assist in understanding the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.\nIt is important that clinicians understand the benefits and limitations of modern neuroimaging techniques and are also suitably equipped to appraise future developments. The use of neuroimaging in evaluating psychopathology is likely to impact upon the future nosology of psychiatric disorders, and assist in diagnosis and clinical management. The integrated use of neuroimaging in conjunction with clinical assessments promises to improve clinical care and markedly alter psychiatric practice."}, {"Title": "Measuring patient dependency in child and adolescent mental health.", "Abstract": "Within the context of child and adolescent mental health inpatient services, a literature review was undertaken to understand the concept of inpatient dependency and how it can be measured.

A major consequence is that the manifestations of the many sleep disorders now identified are likely to be misinterpreted as other clinical conditions of a physical or psychological nature, especially neurological or psychiatric disorders. To illustrate this problem, examples are provided of the various possible causes of sleep loss, poor quality sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness and episodes of disturbed behaviour at night (parasomnias). All of these sleep disorders can adversely affect mental state and behaviour, daytime performance or physical health, the true cause of which needs to be recognised by clinicians to ensure that appropriate treatment is provided. As conventional history taking in neurology and psychiatry pays little attention to sleep and its possible disorders, suggestions are made concerning the enquiries that could be included in history taking schedules to increase the likelihood that sleep disorders will be correctly identified."}, {"Title": "Treatment of aggression with topiramate in male borderline patients, part II: 18-month follow-up.", "Abstract": "We previously tested topiramate, an anticonvulsant, in the treatment of aggression in men with borderline personality disorder (BPD) (Nickel M, Nickel C, Kaplan P, Lahmann C, M\u00fchlbacher M, Tritt K, et al.

The construct of empathy involves not only the affective experience of the other person's actual or inferred emotional state but also some minimal recognition and understanding of another's emotional state. It is proposed, in the light of multiple levels of analysis including social psychology, cognitive neuroscience and clinical neuropsychology, a model of empathy that involves both bottom-up and top-down information processing underpinned by parallel and distributed computational mechanisms. The predictive validity of this model is explored with reference to clinical conditions. As many psychiatric conditions are associated with deficits or even lack of empathy, we discuss a limited number of these disorders including psychopathy/antisocial personality disorders, borderline and narcissistic personality disorders, autistic spectrum disorders, and alexithymia.

In well established community services assertive community teams do not reduce admission but both practitioners and patients prefer this service to other approaches and it leads to better engagement. Crisis resolution teams appear to be more successful than assertive community teams in preventing admission to hospital, although head-to-head comparisons have not yet been made.

In the present analysis, we examined a large clinical mental health database to ascertain the reason for antipsychotic use.We evaluated the extent to which race, gender, age and type of diagnosis accounted for atypical antipsychotic use in children.\nThe authors used an anonymous clinical database created at Duke University Medical Center. The database is based on the clinical document of care in the Department of Psychiatry. The data are de-identified per HIPAA guidelines and has an IRB exemption for use in clinical research. Patients analyzed were seen from 1999 to 2005 and were below the age of 18 at the time of clinical care. A total 3,268 patients, with a total of 7,701 visits comprise the analysis sample. Age, gender, race, and diagnosis were extracted as predictors of use of atypical antipsychotics.\nMales and older children were also more likely to use an atypical. African Americans were slightly more likely to use an atypical than whites. Patients whose diagnoses were classified as either psychotic or internalizing were also more likely to use an antipsychotic.\nThe underlying reasons for the high level of use of atypicals in boys and in African Americans need to be investigated further."}, {"Title": "Adjunctive risperidone in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized trial.", "Abstract": "Residual symptoms despite treatment are common in generalized anxiety disorders (GAD). The Patient-Rated Troubling Symptoms for Anxiety (PaRTS-A) is a newly created and validated instrument that measures the symptoms most troublesome to each individual patient and was used to test the hypothesis that adjunctive risperidone improves residual GAD symptoms.\nPrimary care and psychiatry clinicians enrolled adults (n = 417) with GAD and a Clinical Global Impressions of Severity rating \u2265 4 despite \u2265 8 weeks of anxiolytic treatment. Subjects were randomized to adjunctive risperidone or placebo. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 4 endpoint in PaRTS-A.\nImprovement from baseline to week 4 endpoint in PaRTS-A total score (mean +/-SE) was similar between treatment groups (-8.54 [0.63] and -7.61 [0.64] for adjunctive risperidone and placebo, respectively; P = .265). Patients in each treatment group exhibited significant improvements from baseline in nearly all patient- and clinician-rated measures. A post-hoc analysis of PaRTS-A symptoms of moderate to severe severity at baseline suggested greater improvement with risperidone than placebo (P = .04). Headache, weight increase, and increased appetite were the most frequently reported adverse events in both groups.\nResidual GAD symptoms assessed by the PaRTS-A improved with either adjunctive risperidone or placebo. Alternative analyses or scoring approaches may improve the ability of the PaRTS-A to provide clinically meaningful information on patient-rated symptoms. Further exploration of the benefits of risperidone in patients with more severe GAD may be indicated."}, {"Title": "Non-analytical models of clinical reasoning: the role of experience.", "Abstract": "This paper aims to summarise the evidence supporting the role of experience-based, non-analytic reasoning (NAR) or pattern recognition as a central feature of expert medical diagnosis.\nThe authors examine a series of studies, primarily from their own research programme at McMaster University, that demonstrate that expert and novice diagnostic problem solving is based, to some degree, on similarity to a prior specific exemplar in the memory.\nThe studies reviewed have shown NAR to be a component of diagnostic reasoning at all levels from novice to subspecialist, and in dermatology, electrocardiography and psychiatry. The retrieval process is rapid and is not available to retrospect. It may be based on visual similarity, but can also be present in verbal descriptions. Some evidence exists that the process is unlikely to be available to introspection. Further, early hypotheses based on NAR can result in the re-interpretation of critical clinical findings.\nNon-analytic reasoning is a central component of diagnostic expertise at all levels. Clinical teaching should recognise the centrality of this process, and aim to both enhance the process through the learning of multiple examples and to supplement the process with analytical de-biasing strategies."}, {"Title": "Cavum septum pellucidum in schizophrenia: a case report.", "Abstract": "Different structural alterations of the central nervous system (CNS), such as an increase in ventricular size, decrease in hippocampus and amygdala volume, and other abnormalities that are probably secondary to a loss of neuronal mass and neuropili (axons and dendrite ramifications) linked to a precocious alteration in neurodevelopment are described in patients with schizophrenia in greater proportion than in the general population. The cavum septum pellucidum is among the alterations whose role in the disease is more unknown, since the cavity between the two septum laminae draws attention in very few cases. According to several studies, this alteration is more frequent in patients with schizophrenia than in healthy subjects and currently its association to the disease is being studied.

The modulation of AECP due to exogenous and endogenous attention plays a major role in many clinical applications and has experimentally been studied in neuropsychology. However the relation of corticothalamic feedback dynamics to focal and non-focal attention and its large-scale effect reflected in AECPs is far from being understood. In this paper, we model neural correlates of auditory attention reflected in AECPs using corticothalamic feedback dynamics. We present a mapping of a recently developed multiscale model of evoked potentials to the hearing path and discuss for the first time its neurofunctionality in terms of corticothalamic feedback loops related to focal and non-focal attention. Our model reinforced recent experimental results related to online attention monitoring using AECPs with application as objective tinnitus decompensation measure. It is concluded that our model presents a promising approach to gain a deeper understanding of the neurodynamics of auditory attention and might be use as an efficient forward model to reinforce hypotheses that are obtained from experimental paradigms involving AECPs."}, {"Title": "Off-label use of antipsychotics: rethinking \"off-label\".", "Abstract": "Antipsychotics are currently registered for the use in psychosis, mania and agitation. They have although been in common practice used for a wide range of psychiatric disorders even in the era of first generation antipsychotics. Such a use is termed \"off-label\". There are several drawbacks in off-label antipsychotics' prescribing among them legislative in case of complications, poorly defined criteria for their use (dosages, possible complications, time span), missing guidelines and treatment algorithms as well as missing consensus among clinicians about indications and treatment protocol. We have reviewed existing literature on the topic using Medline search for controlled and naturalistic data about off-label use of antipsychotics. The results have been combined with our descriptive clinical experiences as well as the process of making national recommendations on off-label use of antipsychotics. The results have shown that the practice of off-label use is widely accepted in clinical work not just for antipsychotics but for other psychotropic drugs in psychiatry as well. The level of evidence is however different and will be discussed. Indications for the use of antipsychotics are evolving with new generations, which is consistent with their mechanisms of action and anticipated from drug profiles of different newer antipsychotics. New official indications do show the dynamic properties of the term \"off-label\" which tends to be more a cross-sectional descriptive term rather then scientific fact. According to the evidence and practice antipsychotics are becoming antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, mood stabilizers, cognitive enhancers, anti-aggressive, anti-impulsive, anti-suicidal and hypnotic medications. We will propose a different way to classify the use of antipsychotics in indications different from those officially recognized."}, {"Title": "Myths and facts in contemporary psychopharmacotherapy: evidence-based vs. evidence-biased treatment algorithms practice.", "Abstract": "Evidence based psychiatry and treatment guidelines have a significant role in raising the quality of mental health care and treatment, as well as in providing order where chaos reigns. The purpose of treatment guidelines and algorithms is to provide psychiatrists, health authorities, patients and their families with best evidence for making treatment decisions. However, adherence to some guidelines may do more harm than good if they are not flexible enough to take into account individual patient preferences and circumstances. The paradox at the heart of algorithms-based practice is that gold standard treatments are predicated on statistical generalizations about patients, mental disorders and treatments. In contrast, the effectiveness of a treatment is based on the art and practice of learning organization, the uniqueness of the patient, the doctor-patient relationship and the willingness of the patient to change her/his mental model, life philosophy and the relationships in his family. Treatment guidelines are the lifelines of medical psychiatry and clinical psychopharmacology, without which psychiatry will never reach professional maturity and become fully accepted in medical circles."}, {"Title": "[Phobic orthostatic insecurity].", "Abstract": "The authors attempt to expand knowledge about a subjective balance disorder they have called phobic orthostatic insecurity, a condition representing the second cause of medical visits (22.3 %) to their ENT and neuro-otology clinic, and attempt to identify relationships with similar conditions described in psychiatry (agoraphobia, somatoform vertigo, and space-phobia) and in neurology (phobic postural vertigo). They also propose a simple diagnostic method and present their therapies and results.\nA total of 151 patients with an indefinite symptomatology of \"dizziness\" \"vertigo\" or \"insecurity\" were evaluated (from 1999 to 2005) by means of a full medical history and an appropriate neurological examination, pharmacological treatments with anxiolytics-antidepressives, a measurement of the degree of depression with the Beck test (a kind of psychiatric benchmark) and with a specific standardized test.\nThree symptoms and one exploratory condition, among others, were found in all 151 patients studied; these constitute the four bases for a positive diagnosis. This is confirmed if the treatment achieves total remission (this occurred in 69.53 % of all patients) or a sub-total remission (24.49 %), according to valuation scale for insecurity in all situations.\nThe statistical analysis showed a symptomatic concordance within the group analyzed, a syndromic equivalence between patients and satisfactory results with the antidepressive treatments (94 %), thus confirming the diagnostic and aetiopathogenic hypotheses for the disorder and, later, providing a logical method for diagnosis.

A selection of primary and secondary historical sources is used to trace development of these concepts. Beginning with the spirits of Animism in the 3rd millennium BC, the Greek invention of the soul and its properties, of thymos (emotion), menos (rage) and nous (intellect) are then traced from the time of Homer, in which the soul does not last the death of the body, to Plato in the 4th century BC who argued that the soul, incorporating the nous (now called mind) is incorporeal and immortal. Plato's pupil, Aristotle, commented on the impossibility of an incorporeal soul interacting with a corporeal body. He instituted a revolution in the concept of mind. This involved pointing out that 'mind' is a manner of speaking about our psychological powers as in thinking and remembering. Given that such powers are not a thing the problem does not arise as to the relation between mind and a corporeal body. These ideas of Plato and Aristotle were held by competing scholars and theologians during the next 2000 years. Plato was favoured by many in the Church who could more readily grasp the concept of an immortal and incorporeal soul within the context of Christian thought. Galen established in the 2nd century AD that psychological capacities are associated with the brain, and argued that the fluid-filled ventricles were the part of the brain involved. This argument stood for over 1500 years until the 17th century when Willis, as a consequence of the new blood perfusion techniques developed by Wren following Harvey, showed that blood did not enter the ventricles but the cortex, thereby transferring interest from the ventricles to the cortex. The hegemony of Plato's ideas was broken about this time by Descartes when he argued that the incorporeal soul does not consist of three parts (thymos, nous and menos) but is solely identical with the mind, which is not just concerned with reasoning but with perception and the senses, indeed identical with consciousness 'taken as everything we are aware of happening within us'. The shadow cast by this concept, necessitating as it does relating the Cartesian mind to the cortex, stretches from the time of Willis, through to the foundation figures of neurophysiology and psychiatry in the early 20th century, namely Sherrington and Kraepelin, and beyond. This history is traced in detail because the Cartesian paradigm provides the main resistance to Kraepelin's argument that mental illness has biological concomitants. It is argued that the modern tendency to equate the mind with the brain does not illuminate the problem that was solved by Aristotle. The mind is not as either Plato of Descartes would have it, nor is it equivalent to the brain, for talk of the mind is a manner of talking about human psychological powers and their exercise, as in 'mind your step' (watch where you are going), 'keep that in mind' (remember it). It is suggested that the history of the concept of mind shows that a human being has a corporeal body and a mind, that is, a range of psychological capacities. It is the role of neuropsychiatry to identify the changes in the corporeal that need to be put aright when these psychological capacities go awry."}, {"Title": "The orexin 1 receptor (HCRTR1) gene as a susceptibility gene contributing to polydipsia-hyponatremia in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The underlying pathophysiology of primary polydipsia in schizophrenia (SCZ) is poorly understood. Our previous study, however, suggested that this condition may have a genetic component [Shinkai et al 2003 Am J Med Genet 119B 7-12]. Orexins, also called hypocretins, play an important role in feeding and drinking behavior. Administration of orexin in rats has been shown to induce increased water intake with a longer-lasting effect than angiotensin II, which is also known as a potent dipsogen. Meerabux et al. [2005 Biol Psychiatry 58 401-407] reported an association between the 408Val allele of the orexin 1 receptor (HCRTR1) gene and polydipsia-hyponatremia in a sample of Japanese patients with SCZ. In the present study, we attempted to replicate the findings of Meerabux et al. in an independent Japanese case-control sample. Our sample included 312 patients with SCZ (DSM-IV) (65 with polydipsia and 247 without polydipsia). We also observed an association between the HCRTR1 Ile408Val polymorphism and polydipsia (genotype distribution: chi2 = 9.85, df = 2, P = 0.007). Meerabux et al. (2005) previously demonstrated an association between the 408Val allele of the HCRTR1 gene and polydipsia. In contrast with Meerabux et al. study, we found that the 408Ile allele was associated with polydipsia in our sample (chi2 = 8.00, df = 1, P = 0.0047; OR = 0.53; 95%CI = 0.34-0.83). How either allele contributes to the development of polydipsia in SCZ is unclear at this stage. It is possible that Ile408Val polymorphism is a non-functional marker that lies in linkage disequilibrium with an as-yet undetected functional variant. In any case, our results support the hypothesis that the HCRTR1 Ile408Val polymorphism may confer susceptibility to polydipsia in SCZ. Further studies examining the association between the orexin system and polydipsia in SCZ are warranted."}, {"Title": "Report on an open-label prospective study of divalproex sodium for the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia as monotherapy and in combination with second-generation antipsychotic medication.", "Abstract": "Studies of pharmacotherapy for agitation in dementia have primarily been limited to single-drug trials and have not determined if some forms of agitated behaviors are more responsive to treatment than others.\nThe goal of this study was to determine if manifestations of agitation (ie, physical aggression, physically nonaggressive behavior, and verbally agitated behaviors) show different degrees of response to divalproex sodium (extended release or sprinkles) alone or in combination with second-generation antipsychotic agents.\nThis was a 6-week, open-label, naturalistic pilot study of patients aged >60 years recruited from a geriatric psychiatry inpatient unit, 2 nursing homes, and 4 assisted living residences. Patients were referred for study if they displayed Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia. The primary outcome measure was the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), an instrument whose subscales allow measurement of physically aggressive behaviors, physically nonaggressive behaviors (eg, wandering), and verbally agitated behaviors. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) was also used to assess patients' behavior.\nFifteen patients were included in the study (10 men, 5 women; mean [SD] age, 81.9 [7.7] years). Total CMAI improved by 17.1% at week 1, showed an additional improvement of 3.4% at week 3, and no further improvement by week 6 (total score dropped by 1.1%). Aggressive behavior improved at weeks 3 and 6 while physically nonaggressive and verbally agitated behaviors improved at weeks 1 and 3, and lost much of the gains by week 6. The NPI-NH agitation/aggression score decreased a mean (SE) of 1.3 (0.5) points (P = 0.03), the irritability/lability subscale decreased a mean (SE) of 2.3 (0.6) points (P = 0.005), and the disinhibition subscale decreased a mean (SE) of 1.4 (0.4) points (P < 0.01). Seven patients were on divalproex monotherapy and 8 patients were on combination therapy. Daily doses of divalproex (mean dose, 656 mg/d) in combination with a second-generation antipsychotic were 28% lower than divalproex monotherapy (mean dose, 914 mg/d). The most common adverse events were somnolence (7 of 15) and gait disturbance (5 of 15). One death was observed in the study; the death was due to a prior medical condition and was judged unlikely to be study related.\nPatients with higher levels of agitation receiving divalproex had reduced agitation on the physical aggression subscale of the CMAI. Divalproex was less effective on physically nonaggressive behavior and verbal agitation. Irritability, as measured on the NPI-NH, was also reduced. Patients who received both divalproex and an antipsychotic agent were responsive at lower doses of divalproex. In either case, the effective dosage of divalproex was lower than that commonly used for epilepsy or mania in elderly patients. The most common adverse events included somnolence and gait disturbance."}, {"Title": "The ethics of clinical innovation in psychopharmacology: Challenging traditional bioethics.", "Abstract": "To assess the scientific and ethical basis for clinical innovation in psychopharmacology.\nWe conducted a literature review, utilizing MEDLINE search and bibliographic cross-referencing, and historical evidence regarding the discovery and development of new medications in psychiatry. Clinical innovation was defined as use of treatments in a clinical setting which have not been well-proven in a research setting.\nEmpirical data regarding the impact of clinical innovation in psychopharmacology are lacking. A conceptual and historical assessment of this topic highlights the ethical and scientific importance of clinical innovation. Ethically, it touches a borderline that, in our judgment, is not adequately framed in contemporary mainstream bioethics. Currently, research is viewed as not at all benefiting the patients who participate in it, while clinical care is viewed as being solely for the benefit of patients. Clinical innovation straddles these two worlds, uncomfortably at times. While many argue that clinical innovation should either be avoided or folded into research projects, we argue that clinical innovation is necessary for progress in psychopharmacology research, and that it can prosper best when guided by the following ethical principles: 1.) The treatment should be based on a viable hypothesis. 2.) Whenever possible, one's clinical observations should be reported so they can be evaluated by the scientific community. 3.) One should be willing to report unexpected observations of drug effects. 4.) A high standard of informed consent should be maintained. Again, this proposal goes against the standard view among bioethicists that research and clinical care are categorically opposed activities, as made clear by the either-or dichotomy of the Belmont Report on bioethics. This approach has so polarized our profession into clinicians versus researchers, that many clinicians will not apply new knowledge produced by clinical research until it eventually gets incorporated into formal treatment guidelines, while researchers have little to guide them as to what kind of new knowledge it is most important to provide.\nClinical innovation brings out the ambiguities in our current ethical conceptions of research versus clinical care. Yet, historically, clinical innovation has been an important contributor to progress in psychopharmacology. We argue that clinical innovation should not be discouraged, but rather it should occur under certain ethical conditions.\"Almost everyone can and should do research...because almost everyone has a unique observational opportunity at some time in his life which he has an obligation to record.... If one considers the fundamental operations or methods of research, one immediately realizes that most people do research at some time or another, except that they do not call their activity by that name. There are seven operations.... In simple language they are counting, sorting, measuring, comparing, nature-study, guess testing, and reappraisal.... Guess testing is of course what most people think of when the word research is mentioned; except that it is bad manners to call a guess a guess. It should be called an hypothesis. Let us make one plea. Guessing becomes merely a game unless it is done in the context of a plan for action.

Beneficial responses to complementary and alternative therapies provide important clues about the phenomenal nature of the human body in space-time and disparate biological, informational, and energetic factors associated with normal and abnormal psychological functioning. The conceptual framework of contemporary Western psychiatry includes multiple theoretical viewpoints, and there is no single best explanatory model of mental illness. Future theories of mental illness causation will not depend exclusively on empirical verification of strictly biological processes but will take into account both classically described biological processes and non-classical models, including complexity theory, resulting in more complete explanations of the characteristics and causes of symptoms and mechanisms of action that result in beneficial responses to treatments. Part 1 of this article examines the limitations of the theory and contemporary clinical methods employed in Western psychiatry and discusses implications of emerging paradigms in physics and the biological sciences for the future of psychiatry. In part 2, a practical methodology for planning integrative assessment and treatment strategies in mental health care is proposed. Using this methodology the integrative management of moderate and severe psychiatric symptoms is reviewed in detail. As the conceptual framework of Western medicine evolves toward an increasingly integrative perspective, novel understandings of complex relationships between biological, informational, and energetic processes associated with normal psychological functioning and mental illness will lead to more effective integrative assessment and treatment strategies addressing the causes or meanings of symptoms at multiple hierarchic levels of body-brain-mind."}, {"Title": "Prevalence and cost of musculoskeletal disorders: a population-based, public hospital system healthcare consumption approach.", "Abstract": "To use a population-level, public-hospital approach to compare the prevalence and cost of musculoskeletal diseases (MSD) with other clinical specialties.\nA healthcare utilization survey of 4 million individual records over 4 years, from all major public hospitals in the state of Victoria (estimated population 4.8 million residents in 2000/01) from 1997/98 to 2000/01. Main outcome measures were inpatient episodes of care, bed-days, and outpatient clinic encounters. MSD was defined as the combination of orthopedics and rheumatology.\nAfter obstetrics, MSD was the most frequent outpatient service, with orthopedics accounting for 9.9% of all visits in 2000/01. The proportion of MSD outpatient encounters (on average 11.6% of the total) was constant over the study period. Among 26 medical specialties, MSD had the sixth highest number of inpatient episodes (6.2% in 2000/01), following renal dialysis (14.6%), general surgery (8.2%), obstetrics (7.6%), gastroenterology (7.1%), and general medicine (6.7%). MSD was the fifth highest consumer of bed-days, occupying on average 7.7% of all beds per annum in the period 1997/98 to 2000/01, behind psychiatry (10.1%), respiratory medicine (8.5%), rehabilitation (8.3%), and general medicine (7.8%). MSD was the third most-costly discipline in 2000/01, with total costs of over A dollars 169 million (9.7% of total inpatient costs that year), behind respiratory medicine (11.6%) and general surgery (11.5%).\nCompared to other diseases, MSD consumes a substantial proportion of healthcare resources in Victorian public hospitals.

We investigated the association between HPA activity and psychological profiles in mobbing, using a multidisciplinary approach.\nForty-eight victims of mobbing were evaluated by a working group of the Departments of Occupational Medicine, Psychiatry and Internal Medicine. After an informed consent, a detailed occupational history, a psychiatric interview with Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2 (MMPI-2) administration and a blood sample (8:00 AM) for the determination of basal adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) plasma levels were collected. Twenty-six patients received an overnight dexamethasone (dex) test.\nMean ACTH, cortisol and DHEAS levels were within normal ranges. The dex-test response was normal, with a significant hormone suppression (ACTH p<0.001, cortisol p<0.001, DHEAS p<0.001). The correlations between basal hormones and the psychometric scales of MMPI-2 revealed that cortisol was significantly and negatively related to Psychasthenia (Pt, p=0.003) and Depression (D, p=0.006), while DHEAS showed a significant negative correlation to Hysteria (Hy, p=0.008). Basal ACTH levels were not significantly related to psychometric scales.\nA significant inverse correlation between morning plasma cortisol levels and psychometric parameters in victims of mobbing with adjustment disorders was observed. A larger group of patients is necessary to identify and validate a cut-off cortisol level that may become an innovative biological parameter for the diagnosis and follow-up in victims of mobbing."}, {"Title": "Relevance of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Extensive preclinical studies suggest neuropeptide Y (NPY) to be involved in stress regulation and coping. NPY counteracts the behavioral consequences of stress and anxiety to maintain emotional homeostasis. NPY is also involved in learning, memory, and cognition, all of which are dysregulated in many psychiatric states. Dense localization of NPY and NPY receptors is found in brain areas implicated in psychopathology such as the amygdala, hippocampus, neocortex, septum, caudate-putamen, hypothalamus and locus coeruleus. Impaired central NPY signaling may therefore be involved in the pathophysiology of depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, alcoholism, and trauma-induced disorders like PTSD. Studies on the readily accessible plasma from psychiatric patients have provided some information on the relevance of NPY as a marker for sympathetic tone in certain conditions. Reports on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NPY in subjects with depression indicate a dysregulation of central NPY in this disorder, however, other conditions still need to be investigated."}, {"Title": "Age and gender effects on olanzapine and risperidone plasma concentrations in children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "Risperidone and olanzapine are second-generation antipsychotics that are increasingly used in child and adolescent psychiatry. So far, little is known about plasma concentrations and concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratios of these agents in children and adolescents compared to adults.\nThis study investigated whether age and gender influence risperidone and olanzapine plasma concentration by determining risperidone and olanzapine plasma levels by tandem mass spectrometry in 162 Caucasian patients (98 risperidone and 64 olanzapine).\nFor risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone, the C(total)/D ratio was almost identical in both age groups (10-18 and 19-45 years, respectively). In the younger age group, females exhibited significantly higher total plasma levels than males while receiving similar doses of risperidone. For olanzapine, in adolescents significantly higher C/D ratios were detected by an average of 43% (after adjustment for weight: 34%) compared to adults.\nThis study demonstrates an age effect for olanzapine but not for risperidone resulting in higher olanzapine plasma levels in younger patients. For risperidone, we found a gender effect as female adolescent patients had significantly higher risperidone plasma concentrations than male adolescent patients. Future prospective studies are necessary to clarify whether the prescribed dosage should be different in young and older patients."}, {"Title": "Low-level neonatal thimerosal exposure: further evaluation of altered neurotoxic potential in SJL mice.", "Abstract": "Ethylmercury in thimerosal-preserved childhood vaccines has been suggested to be neurotoxic and to contribute to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism. Immune system function may be an important factor influencing vulnerability of the developing nervous system to thimerosal. This possibility is based in part on a report by Hornig et al. (2004, Mol. Psychiatry 9, 833-845) of neurodevelomental toxicity in SJL/J mice that develop autoantibodies when exposed to organic mercury. The present study reexamined this possibility by injecting neonatal SJL/J mice with thimerosal, with and without combined HiB and DTP vaccines. Injections modeled childhood vaccination schedules, with mice injected on postnatal days 7, 9, 11, and 15 with 14.2, 10.8, 9.2, and 5.6 mug/kg mercury from thimerosal, respectively, or vehicle. Additional groups received vaccine only or a 10 times higher thimerosal + vaccine dose. Low levels of mercury were found in blood, brain, and kidneys 24 h following the last thimerosal injection. Survival, body weight, indices of early development (negative geotaxis, righting) and hippocampal morphology were not affected. Performance was unaffected in behavioral tests selected to assess behavioral domains relevant to core deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism (i.e., social interaction, sensory gating, anxiety). In an open-field test the majority of behaviors were unaffected by thimerosal injection, although thimerosal-injected female mice showed increased time in the margin of an open field at 4 weeks of age. Considered together the present results do not indicate pervasive developmental neurotoxicity following vaccine-level thimerosal injections in SJL mice, and provide little if any support for the hypothesis that thimerosal exposure contributes to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders."}, {"Title": "Lantus overdose: case presentation and management options.", "Abstract": "Insulin glargine (Lantus, Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Bridgewater, NJ) is a long-acting once-daily dosed form of insulin intended to maintain a constant baseline insulin level.

The smoking issue in psychiatry can be considered a neglected problem].", "Abstract": "The present study was conducted to obtain information about smoking status of psychiatric patients and to determine whether there might be a demand for smoking cessation support for this group of people. In addition, the smoking status of psychiatric medical staff members, their awareness regarding smoking and related issues, and their attitude to promotion efforts to ameliorate smoking in their working place were examined.\nOutpatients and inpatients with schizophrenia, mood disorders, and alcoholism in Koutokukai Sato Hospital during December 2001 and May 2002, and staff of the hospital were the subjects in this study. We surveyed smoking status in both 296 patients and 222 staff members.\nSmoking rates were 77.4% in males and 39.3% in females among patients with schizophrenia, 87.5% in males and 100% in females among patients with bipolar mood disorders, 69.6% in males and 5.4% in females among patients with depression, and 86.7% in males and 100% in females among patients with alcoholism. Among those smokers, 78.1% were nicotine dependent. However, 75.7% of these smokers were interested in smoking cessation, and 49.0% hoped for prohibition of smoking. The findings thus indicated that the demand for smoking cessation support is high in psychiatric patients. Among the staff, the smoking rate was also high, at 45.5% (males: 76.6% and females: 29.0%). As for the age at beginning of smoking, the peaks were at 18 years old and 20 years old. Smokers who smoked less than 20 cigarettes per day accounted for 80% of the total. Of the smokers, 91.1% recognized that their smoking bothered the people around them. If the working place was smoke free, however, 66.3% answered it would be difficult to adapt, and only 24% wanted to stop smoking recently. On the other hand, 29.8% of the non-smokers were bothered with smoking at the working place, and 76.0% hated smoke of cigarettes. When one wanted a smoker not to smoke, 22.7% of the non-smokers could say so. Of the staff members, 80.0% agreed with anti-smoking measures. However, it appeared that their consciousness of smoking issues was low as medical workers.\nThe smoking rate of psychiatric patients and the prevalence of nicotine dependence are high. However, half of the subjects in the present study expressed a desire to quit smoking, pointing to a high demand of smoking cessation support. Psychiatric staff at the institution studied had a high smoking rate, and their recognition of smoking issues was low."}, {"Title": "Incomplete coverage of candidate genes: a poorly considered bias.", "Abstract": "Current genetic investigations are performed both on the basis of a rational and biologically based choice of candidate genes and through genome wide scans.

To effectively prepare fellows for academic leadership, the University of Rochester's Division of Geriatrics, in collaboration with the Warner School of Graduate Education, created a yearlong course to achieve excellence in teaching and career development during the 1-year geriatric fellowship. Nine interdisciplinary geriatric medicine, dentistry, and psychiatry fellows completed the course in its initial year (2005/06). As participants, fellows gained the knowledge and experience to successfully develop and implement educational initiatives in various formats. Fellows acquired teaching and leadership skills necessary to succeed as clinician-educators in an academic setting and to communicate effectively with patients, families, and colleagues. Fellows completed a series of individual and group education projects, including academic portfolio development, curriculum vitae revision, abstract submission and poster presentation at national meetings, lay lecture series development, and geriatric grand rounds presentation. One hundred percent of fellows reported that the course positively affected their career development, with six of nine fellows choosing academic careers. The course provided opportunities to teach and assess all six of the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education core competencies. This academic career development course was intended to prepare geriatric fellows as the next generation of academic leaders as clinician-teacher-scholars. It could set a new standard for academic development during fellowship training and provide a model for national dissemination in other geriatric and subspecialty fellowship programs."}, {"Title": "Urologist practice patterns in the management of premature ejaculation: a nationwide survey.", "Abstract": "Contemporary U.S. urologist's \"real world\" practice patterns in treating premature ejaculation (PE) are unknown.\nTo ascertain contemporary urologist practice patterns in the management of PE.\nA randomly generated mailing list of 1,009 practicing urologists was generated from the American Urologic Association (AUA) member directory. A custom-designed survey was mailed to these urologists with a cover letter and a return-address envelope. Responses were compared with the AUA 2004 guidelines for the treatment of PE.\nThe survey assessed several practice-related factors and asked questions of how the subject would handle various presentations of PE in their practice.\nResponses from practicing urologists totaled 207 (21%). Eighty-four percent of the respondents were in private practice and 11% were in academics. Most urologists (73%) saw less than one PE patient per week. On-demand selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy was the most commonly selected first line treatment (26%), with daily dosing a close second (22%). Combination SSRI therapy, the \"stop/start\" technique, the \"squeeze\" technique, and topical anesthetics were favored by 13, 18, 18, and 11% of the respondents, respectively. If primary treatment failed, changing dosing of SSRIs, topical anesthetics, and referral to psychiatry were increasingly popular options. Ten percent of urologists would treat PE before erectile dysfunction (ED) in a patient with both conditions, with the remainder of the respondents treating ED first, typically with a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (78% of total). Fifty-one percent of urologists report that they would inquire about the sexual partner, but only 8, 7, and 4% would evaluate, refer, or treat the partner, respectively.\nThe majority of our respondents diagnose PE by patient complaint, and treat ED before PE, as per the 2004 PE guidelines. Very few urologists offer referral or treatment to sexual partners of men suffering from PE.

The temporal organization of a given biological function can be impaired in its coordination with astronomical time or with other biological functions. There are also external conditions that influence biological clocks. This temporal organization is complex, and it is possible that a series of psychiatric disorders and syndromes involve primary or secondary changes in biological clocks: seasonal and other mood disorders, premenstrual syndromes, social jet lag, free-running rhythms, and several sleep disorders are among them.

Despite its apparent relevance to health, there have been no recent state or national population-based U.S. studies regarding social and emotional support. In order to better address this issue, we examined health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and health behaviors by level of social and emotional support in community-dwelling adults in the United States and its territories.\nData were obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, an ongoing, state-based, random digit telephone survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population aged > or =18 years. In 2005, one social and emotional support question, four HRQOL questions, two disability questions, one life satisfaction question, and four health behavior questions were administered in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. An additional five HRQOL questions were administered in two states.\nAn estimated 8.6% of adults reported that they rarely/never received social and emotional support; ranging in value from 4.2% in Minnesota to 12.4% in the U.S. Virgin Islands. As the level of social and emotional support decreased, the prevalence of fair/poor general health, dissatisfaction with life, and disability increased, as did the mean number of days of physical distress, mental distress, activity limitation, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, insufficient sleep, and pain. Moreover, the prevalence of smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and heavy drinking increased with decreasing level of social and emotional support. Additionally, the mean number of days of vitality slightly decreased with decreasing level of social and emotional support; particularly between those who always/usually received social and emotional support and those who sometimes received support.\nThese findings indicate that the assessment of social and emotional support is highly congruent with the practice of psychiatry.

Individuals with psychiatric disorders show altered decision-making. They select options that are either non-optimal or nonhomeostatic. These dysfunctional patterns of decision-making in individuals with psychiatric disorders may fundamentally relate to problems with homeostatic regulation. These may manifest themselves in (i) how the length of time between decisions and their outcomes influences subsequent decision-making, (ii) how gain and loss feedback are integrated to determine the optimal decision, (iii) how individuals adapt their decision strategies to match the specific context, or (iv) how seemingly maladaptive responses result from an attempt to establish an unstable homeostatic balance."}, {"Title": "[Attempted suicide.

The main causes of suicide are mood disorders and particularly depression, although certain personality features (low self-esteem, hopelessness, introversion, neuroticism, etc.) and stress are considered to be predisposing factors. Suicidal behavior is therefore a routine part of emergency psychiatry. Consequently, evaluation of the parasuicidal patient is fundamental in emergency departments due to the potential seriousness of the phenomenon and the increase in the frequency of this type of behavior. Furthermore, evaluation is essential to provide a more optimal therapeutic approach and appropriate referral and to improve treatment compliance.

The samples had been collected for routine therapeutic drug monitoring purposes from 1179 patients treated with quetiapine. A log-linear mixed model was used to identify factors influencing the dose-corrected quetiapine serum concentration, expressed as the quetiapine concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratio. Variables included in the analysis were age, gender, and concomitant treatment with a total of 41 drugs most often used in combination with quetiapine.\nAge >or= 70 years (p = .001) and comedication with alimemazine (p = .002), fluvoxamine (p = .001), citalopram/escitalopram (p = .041), or clozapine (p < .001) significantly increased the serum concentrations of quetiapine, while age < 18 years (p = .044) and comedication with lamotrigine (p = .024), levomepromazine (p = .011), oxazepam (p < .001), or carbamazepine (p < .001) significantly decreased the serum concentrations.

In 18% of the samples, the daily dose exceeded the currently recommended maximum of 800 mg/day.\nDue to the increased serum levels of quetiapine, a lower dose than usual should be considered when quetiapine is administered to elderly patients and to patients comedicated with clozapine or fluvoxamine. As the inducing effect of carbamazepine on quetiapine metabolism is very potent, cotreatment with carbamazepine cannot be recommended.

The present article reviews the relevant literature and summarizes neurobiological effects of exercise which might play a role in the effectiveness of therapeutic exercise. For instance, there is experimental evidence, that regular exercise induces a downregulation of central 5-HT(2C) receptors which play an important role in the pathogenesis of anxiety and depression. The production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)is stimulated in several brain regions.

In Africa, particularly Nigeria, despite the prevalent dermatological disorders with their possible attendant mental health complications, little or no work has been done in the field of psycho-dermatology, hence the rationale for this study.\nA prospective study was carried out in the dermatology/venerology clinic of Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH). Ethical clearance and consent were obtained to conduct the study. The subjects were selected by simple random sampling from adult patients that have had their dermatological disorders for at least six months before presentation in the clinic. Those with other co-existing chronic medical illness such as hypertension, diabetes, or haemoglobinopathy were excluded from the study. Controls were obtained to match for age and sex from apparently healthy workers in a nearby general hospital. Each subject was evaluated with a questionnaire to obtain necessary socio-demographic data: Psychache scale (PAS), and subscales C, D, and J of Symptom Check List (SCL-90). The data generated was analyzed to obtain means, and t-test was used to compare the means; p = 0.05 was taken as being significant. The analyses were done using SPSS version 10.\nEighty subjects with dermatological disorders, and of equal sex distribution, were evaluated, with mean age of 33 +/- 12.1 years. Equal number of controls matched for sex and mean age of 34.6 +/- 7.3 years were also evaluated. Among the subjects, 16.3% had Acne, followed by Urticaria (13.8%), Vitiligo (12.5%), Tinea (11.3%), Hansen's disease (5%), and others (41.1%). From assessment with PAS and SCL subscales, the mean scores by the subjects were much higher than those of the controls and in each group the males scored slightly higher than their female counterparts. On assessment with PAS, the subjects had much higher mean score of 28.94 +/- 12.61 and the controls: 18.92 +/- 7.1 with \"t\" of 6.19*; and the difference was statistically significant at p < 0.05 and critical \"t\" of 1.66.

The 8-wk third year surgery clerkship at our institution can be an intense learning experience, and we hypothesized that during this clerkship medical student quality-of-life would drop significantly from baseline, and that this drop would be greater among certain subgroups, such as women students not interested in pursuing a surgical career, and those who place a high value on a controllable lifestyle.\nAt clerkship orientation (baseline), students were asked to complete a survey that measured quality-of-life on an 84-point scale, and depression on a 40-point scale. The quality-of-life scale was composed of select questions from the Medical Outcomes Study, and the Harvard Department of Psychiatry/NDSD brief screening instrument was used to measure depression. Students were also asked the typical number of hours they slept per night. Demographics, attitude toward a controllable lifestyle, and top three specialties of interest were also gathered at baseline. On week 6 of the clerkship, students were surveyed on the same quality-of -life and depression scales, and asked average hours of sleep per night for the previous week.\nFrom June 2005 through December 2006, 143 of 177 (81%) students agreed to participate, and after exclusions for missing data, 137 students were included in the analysis. Sixty-nine students were women (51%), and the average age was 25.8 (sd 2.6). Mean quality-of-life at baseline was 57.0 (sd 11.3) and at week 6 was 50.4 (sd 10.1) representing a statistically significant average decline of 6.6 points (P < 0.0001). Mean depression at baseline was 14.4 (sd 3.8) and at week 6 was 15.1 (sd 3.6), representing a small but significant average decline of 0.7 points (P = 0.0155). Mean sleep at baseline was 6.3 h/night (sd 0.9) and at week 6 was 5.7 h/night (sd 1.2), representing a statistically significant average decline of 0.6 h/night (P < 0.0001). Declines were similar on all outcomes between men versus women, those who ranked surgery in their top three career choices versus those who did not, and those who ranked controllable lifestyle as \"very important\" versus all other categories.\nQuality-of-life and sleep declines and depression increases significantly in third-year medical students from orientation to week 6 of their surgery clerkship at our institution.

Such methods may be applied to functional neuroimaging data in patient groups to aid in the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and the prediction of treatment response. We sought to examine the sensitivity and specificity of whole brain pattern classification of implicit processing of sad facial expressions in depression.\nNineteen medication-free patients with depression and 19 healthy volunteers had been recruited for a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study involving serial scans. The fMRI paradigm entailed incidental affective processing of sad facial stimuli with modulation of the intensity of the emotional expression (low, medium, and high intensity). The fMRI data were analyzed at each level of affective intensity with a support vector machine pattern classification method.\nThe pattern of brain activity during sad facial processing correctly classified up to 84% of patients (sensitivity) and 89% of control subjects (specificity), corresponding to an accuracy of 86% (p < .0001). Classification of patients' clinical response at baseline, prior to the initiation of treatment, showed a trend toward significance.\nSignificant classification of patients in an acute depressive episode was achieved with whole brain pattern analysis of fMRI data.

According to Natalie Banner and Tim Thornton, the series represents a clear indication that the interdisciplinary field of philosophy of psychiatry has been flourishing lately. Philosophers and psychiatrists face a \"new philosophy of psychiatry\". However, the optimism which the \"new\" philosophy of psychiatry celebrates is precisely the exiling of philosophy from the foundations of psychiatry. The 150 year old belief that psychopathology cannot do without philosophical reflection has virtually disappeared from common psychiatric education and daily clinical practice. Though the discipline of psychiatry is particularly suited to contributions from philosophy, the impact of philosophy on psychiatry nowadays remains limited. With some exceptions, philosophical papers are embedded in a philosophical context inscrutable to ordinary psychiatrists. Much current philosophical work is perceived by psychiatrists as negativistic. I would encourage the field of psychiatry to incorporate once again basic philosophical attitudes which render possible true dialogue with philosophy and enrich both disciplines.

The birth month of each adolescent was categorized into one of the four seasons: spring (March-May), summer (June-August), autumn (September-November) or winter (December-February). The information on SMB was based on the K-SADS-PL interview, which included an item on nonsuicidal physical self-damaging acts without intent to die. A total of 144 adolescents (27 males, 117 females) met the criteria for SMB. The association between season of birth and SMB was assessed with a logistic regression analysis after controlling for each adolescent's age, previous suicide attempts and DSM-IV-diagnosed psychiatric disorders.\nThe monthly distribution of births of adolescents with SMB differed statistically significantly from that observed in the general population of the same age. An association between season of birth and SMB was seen in girls, but not in boys. The likelihood for SMB was significantly increased (adjusted OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.4-6.2) among girls born in autumn compared to those born in winter.\nBirth during autumn may predispose girls to SMB via dysfunctional serotonergic or other neurotransmitter systems.

In an initial preliminary high dose study, clozapine at 6 and 12 mg/kg (i.p., b.i.d.) was found to induce weight loss. In a subsequent intermediate dose study, we obtained no evidence for clozapine-induced weight gain despite using identical procedures and doses of clozapine (1-4 mg/kg, i.p., b.i.d.) with which we have observed olanzapine-induced weight gain, hyperphagia, enhanced adiposity and metabolic changes [Cooper G, Pickavance L, Wilding J, Halford J, Goudie A (2005). A parametric analysis of olanzapine-induced weight gain in female rats. Psychopharmacology; 181: 80-89.]. Instead, clozapine induced weight loss without alteration in food intake and muscle mass or changes in levels of glucose, insulin, leptin and prolactin. However, these intermediate doses of clozapine enhanced visceral adiposity and elevated levels of adiponectin. In a final study, low doses of clozapine (0.25-0.5 mg/kg, i.p, b.i.d.) induced weight loss. These data demonstrate that clozapine-induced weight gain can be much more difficult to observe in female rats than olanzapine-induced weight gain. Moreover, these findings contrast with clinical findings with clozapine, which induces substantial weight gain in humans. Clozapine-induced enhanced adiposity appears to be easier to observe in rats than weight gain. These findings, along with other preclinical studies, suggest that enhanced adiposity can be observed in the absence of antipsychotic-induced weight gain and hyperphagia, possibly reflecting a direct drug effect on adipocyte function independent of drug-induced hyperphagia [e.g. Minet-Ringuet J, Even P, Valet P, Carpene C, Visentin V, Prevot D, Daviaud D, Quignard-Boulange A, Tome D, de Beaurepaire R (2007). Alterations of lipid metabolism and gene expression in rat adipocytes during chronic olanzapine treatment. Molecular Psychiatry; 12: 562-571.]. These and other findings which show that the results of studies of antipsychotic treatment in animals do not always mimic clinical findings have important implications for the use of animal models of antipsychotic-induced weight gain. With regard to weight gain the results obtained appear to depend critically on the experimental procedures used and the specific drugs studied. Thus such models are not without limitations. However, they do consistently demonstrate the ability of various antipsychotics to enhance adiposity."}, {"Title": "[Can depressed patients stop smoking?

It is surprising, therefore, that psychiatry does not do more to persuade these patients to stop smoking.\nTo ascertain whether a stop-smoking programme should be a standard module of a treatment programme for depression.\nA literature search was conducted with the help of PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library and using the search terms: 'major depressive disorder', 'nicotine dependence', 'smoking and smoking cessation'.\nThere is high comorbidity between daily smoking and depression. Genetic factors and acute life-events are risk factors for this comorbidity. Very little research has been done to find out whether depressed patients who quit smoking attain long-lasting abstinence and what the effects of quitting are on their depressive symptoms. Smokers with a history of depression seem to benefit from a stop-smoking programme but it is uncertain whether they also run an increased risk of a new depressive episode.\nThere are good reasons for adding a stop-smoking programme to a programme for treating depression in patients who smoke.

His investigation exposed variables that ultimately lead to the concept of Expressed Emotion (EE). Much of the literature and research on EE revolves around the family environment; however there is some literature that identifies that EE may not only occur with family members. EE may also be attributed to staff and their interaction with patients. This paper presents two case studies that will help elucidate EE with staff, family and the environment.

This article reviews these and other findings from this important trial and offers a perspective regarding their meaning for practice and their significance for the advancement of research in psychiatry. The primary outcome measure, time to discontinuation, served as an index of effectiveness and was remarkably short; only 26% of subjects completed the 18-month trial on the medicine to which they were initially randomized. Subjects receiving olanzapine experienced a slightly longer time to discontinuation. Based on this single criterion, olanzapine showed greater effectiveness than the other agents despite its association with significant metabolic disturbance, especially weight gain. Perphenazine unexpectedly showed comparable levels of effectiveness and produced no more extrapyramidal side effects than the other agents. Despite modest prolactin elevation, risperidone was the best-tolerated medication. Ziprasidone was associated with weight loss and with positive impact on lipids and blood glucose. In Phase 2, clozapine demonstrated better effectiveness compared to other SGAs for subjects who discontinued their Phase 1 medication because of efficacy. Olanzapine and risperidone showed greater effectiveness in the tolerability pathway. CATIE secondary outcomes are currently being examined. Improvements in cognition were modest among all the agents in Phase 1, and perphenazine was no less effective in improving cognitive performance than the SGAs. Cost-effectiveness analysis revealed a significant advantage for perphenazine, due to the impact of the high-priced, brand-name SGAs on overall health care costs."}, {"Title": "The evaluation and management of patients with first-episode schizophrenia: a selective, clinical review of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.", "Abstract": "Patients who present with a first episode of psychosis pose many challenges to psychiatry.

We aimed to find support in scientific literature about infanticide, point out an interdisciplinary health team's affliction and uncertainties when faced with this kind of case and suggest strategies for dealing with these feelings and their possible consequences in dealing with this case. Professionals involved in this case observed their discomfort about the situation and difficulties caused by feelings of guilt about the child's death, whether intentional or not. Specialists suggests that the relation between psychiatry and the law should be facilitated by \"demedicalizing\" the crime, including socioeconomic factors, comorbidities, domestic violence, cultural norms etc. The team must try and learn from these mothers, overcoming their anger or repulsion with compassion and courage to understand infanticide."}, {"Title": "Recent translations of Foucault on mental health.", "Abstract": "The work of the French philosopher and historian, Michel Foucault, often dealt with subjects either directly or indirectly related to psychiatry.

The latter, however, should be carefully examined after considering the patient's cultural and subcultural background, and the quality of the doctor's communication skills.\nAcademic and clinical psychiatry are posed with such questions as to how to categorically classify capacity and incapacity as well as to evidence the admissibility of measuring instruments when used in a civil commitment."}, {"Title": "Missing links in phenomenological clinical neuroscience: why we still are not there yet.", "Abstract": "The phenomenology or systematic study of the patient's subjective experience in neuropsychiatric disorders is widely recognized as important. The methods used, the type of 'knowledge' obtained and the relationship of these observations to standard methods of clinical neuroscience, however, remain ill-defined and highly controversial.\nAdvances in the phenomenology of consciousness, self, body-experience, time-perception and intersubjectivity of neuropsychiatric disorders have been made. This review examines two differing approaches to the phenomenological psychiatry-neuroscience interface: the neo-phenomenological approach claims that some of its key concepts (e.g. the hyperreflexivity/ipseity model, prereflective self-awareness) are able to constrain neuroscience; the existential-phenomenological approach counters that phenomenology's role is not to constrain neuroscience but to provide hypotheses for further experimental study. This review compares these two approaches and assesses the current success of their respective claims.\nBy integrating work of largely untranslated authors, such as Binswanger, Blankenburg, and von Weizsaecker, neglected or cited out of context in the neo-phenomenological approach, the existential-phenomenological approach provides the 'missing links' between phenomenology and clinical neuroscience in a newly emerging but still fragile balance between disciplines.

We have previously assessed 5-HT1AR binding potential (BP) in depression using positron emission tomography (PET) and [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635, and we have demonstrated reduced 5-HT1AR BP in the mesiotemporal cortex (MTC) and raphe in depressives with primary recurrent familial mood disorders (n=12) versus controls (n=8) [Drevets WC, Frank E, Price JC, Kupfer DJ, Holt D, Greer PJ, Huang Y, Gautier C, Mathis C. PET imaging of serotonin 1A receptor binding in depression. Biol Psychiatry 1999;46(10):1375-87]. These findings were replicated by some, but not other, studies performed in depressed samples that were more generally selected using criteria for MDD. In the current study, we attempted to replicate our previous findings in an independent sample of subjects selected according to the criteria for primary recurrent depression applied in our prior study.\nUsing PET and [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635, 5-HT1AR BP was assessed in 16 depressed subjects and 8 healthy controls.\nMean 5-HT1AR BP was reduced by 26% in the MTC (P<.005) and by 43% in the raphe (P<.001) in depressives versus controls.\nThese data replicate our original findings, which showed that BP was reduced by 27% in the MTC (P<.025) and by 42% in the raphe (P<.02) in depression. The magnitudes of these reductions in 5-HT1AR binding were similar to those found postmortem in 5-HT1AR mRNA concentrations in the hippocampus in MDD [L\u00f3pez JF, Chalmers DT, Little KY, Watson SJ.

Serotonin 1A receptors, serotonin transporter binding and serotonin transporter mRNA expression in the brainstem of depressed suicide victims. Neuropsychopharmacology 2001;25(6):892-903]. There exists disagreement within the literature, however, regarding the presence and direction of 5-HT1AR-binding abnormalities in depression, which may be explained in some cases by differences in anatomical location (e.g., [Stockmeier CA, Shapiro LA, Dilley GE, Kolli TN, Friedman L, Rajkowska G. Increase in serotonin-1A autoreceptors in the midbrain of suicide victims with major depression--postmortem evidence for decreased serotonin activity. J Neurosci 1998;18(18):7394-401]) and in other cases by pathophysiological heterogeneity within MDD (e.g., some depressives hypersecrete cortisol, which would be expected to down-regulate 5-HT1AR expression [L\u00f3pez JF, Chalmers DT, Little KY, Watson SJ. Regulation of serotonin 1A, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid receptor in rat and human hippocampus: implications for neurobiology of depression. Biol Psychiatry 1998;43:547-73]).

The idea had already plagued philosophers such as Rousseau, who considered the civilization of man as going against human nature, and eventually \"sparked over\" to the medical sciences in the late 19th and early 20th century. At that time, human \"self-domestication\" appealed to psychiatry, because it served as a causal explanation for the alleged degeneration of the \"erbgut\" (genetic material) of entire populations and the presumed increase of mental disorders. Consequently, Social Darwinists emphasised preventing procreation by people of \"lower genetic value\" and positively selecting favourable traits in others. Both tendencies culminated in euthanasia and breeding programs (\"Lebensborn\") during the Nazi regime in Germany. Whether or not domestication actually plays a role in some anatomical changes since the late Pleistocene period is, from a biological standpoint, contentious, and the currently resurrected debate depends, in part, on the definitional criteria applied. However, the example of human self-domestication may illustrate that scientific ideas, especially when dealing with human biology, are prone to misuse, particularly if \"is\" is confused with \"ought\", i.e., if moral principles are deduced from biological facts. Although such naturalistic fallacies appear to be banned, modern genetics may, at least in theory, pose similar ethical problems to medicine, including psychiatry. In times during which studies into the genetics of psychiatric disorders are scientifically more valued than studies into environmental causation of disorders (which is currently the case), the prospects of genetic therapy may be tempting to alter the human genome in patients, probably at costs that no-one can foresee. In the case of \"self-domestication\", it is proposed that human characteristics resembling domesticated traits in animals should be labelled \"domestication-like\", or better, objectively described as genuine adaptations to sedentism."}, {"Title": "Primary care patients in psychiatric clinical trials: a pilot study using videoconferencing.", "Abstract": "While primary care physicians play a pivotal role in the treatment of depression, collaboration between primary care and psychiatry in clinical research has been limited.

Moreover, analyses distinguishing youths with \"pure\" internalizing disorders from those with comorbid internalizing and externalizing disorders, \"pure\" externalizing disorders, and other psychiatric disorders showed that the association with atopic disorders was specific for \"pure\" internalizing disorders only (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.09 to 5.30, p = .03).\nAtopic disorders may be associated specifically with \"pure\" internalizing disorders in psychiatrically ill youths.

The most intense critiques have centered around the authoritarian power lodged in a self-selected training analyst elite, the inadequate development of a psychoanalytic research tradition, and the isolation of our educational structure from cognate disciplines concerned with human mental life, owing to its private and part-time nature, apart from the university with its spectrum of biological and human sciences. Efforts to reform this system, including the establishment of psychoanalytic institutes within medical school departments of psychiatry, and the further call for their autonomous placement within the university at large, with full-time students and faculty, have been only partially successful and have not become widespread.

Using criteria and methods of evidence-based medicine, in this paper possible algorithms for ADHD and comorbid disorders are presented. In conclusion, these algorithms aim to support health care professionals and can serve as guideline in decision making in pharmacotherapy. Stimulants are first-line medication treatment of ADHD without comorbid disorder. In co-existing aggression, major depressive disorder and tic disorder treatment with stimulants should be initialized at first. Only in case of unchanged persistence of comorbid symptoms specific pharmacological therapy should be combined.

This poses particular challenges given the limited familiarity with ADHD of many adult mental health services. As a result, several organizations, including the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the National Institutes of Health, and the British Association for Psychopharmacology, have developed practice guidelines for the assessment and treatment of adults with ADHD. This article reviews those guidelines in order to examine current best practices in adult ADHD.

This study hopes to generate data that can help managers and doctors to improve the standard of care they provide in line with the wishes of the patients.\nIt was a cross sectional study carried out at a major tertiary care hospital of Karachi. Patients between the ages of 18 and 80 years admitted to the hospital for at least one day were included. Patients in the maternity, psychiatry and chemotherapy wards and those in the ICU/CCU were excluded. A pretested, peer reviewed translation of a validated patient satisfaction scale developed by the Picker Institute of Europe was administered.\nA total of 173 patients (response rate: 78.6 %) filled the questionnaire. Patient satisfaction was at levels comparable to European surveys for most aspects of hospital care.

Up to one third of the patients said they were not provided enough information regarding their operative procedures beforehand.\nAlthough several components of patient care equal the quality levels of the west, many sections require considerable improvement in order to improve health care provision.

BOLD-imaging provides an indirect indication of neuronal activity. Future developments of different neuroimaging techniques are promising not only in surgical planning, functional assessment in brain tumor management, monitoring functional changes, but also in discovery of pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and recognition of new pharmacological targets. Those techniques could be implemented in the process of drug discovery and identification of biomarkers which are clinically relevant for development of candidate drugs.

We assume that genetic polymorphisms of serotoninergic transporter and MDR1 could be important in prediction of therapeutic response in patients with major depression treated with paroxetine.

The idea applying antipsychotics in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia today is an realistic option. However ethical dilemmas about offering antipsychotics to the adolescents with at risk mental states, of whom only a few are real prodromes of schizophrenia remain for clinicians. In the literature about the ethics of the early interventions in psychiatry there are still many ethical questions which call for caution because of the low predictive value of at risk mental states, of which only 40% turn out to be a real prodrome of schizophrenia. These ethical questions can be addressed in three categories: - how to best identify who should receive early pharmacological intervention? - what this intervention should consist of? - how to evaluate treatment efficacy in the absence of illness base rates in the adolescents with a real prodrome of schizophrenia? Besides, arguing against the concept of early psychopharmacological interventions in the adolescent population are the fact of the unknown effect of antipsychotics on the developing brain as well as negative effects of stigma on those adolescents who receive them. The authors in the article analyse these ethical questions and take the side of those clinicians who think that caution and careful ethical judgment are needed before the prescribing of antipsychotics to adolescents with at risk mental states."}, {"Title": "Pharmacotherapy for the soul and psychotherapy for the body.", "Abstract": "The \"mind-body\" dualism has shaped the development of psychiatry. At the very beginning psychiatry was related to the mind and the rest of the medicine to the body. The main reasons for such division were lack of biological evidence for psychiatric disorders and wrong beliefs about demonic origins of \"lunacy\". But although the development of science offered more than enough biological evidence to understand brain as an organ of origin for psychiatric disorders, the dualism of mind and body remained alive even in the modern classification systems. One of the consequences was another dualism that differ biological (e.g. pharmacotherapy) from psychological therapy (e.g. psychotherapy) as completely different approaches. The purpose of this article is to offer enough evidence to reframe the existing dualisms into a different paradigm. In every illness both mind and body can be affected to a different extent. Which part of an illness is body and which part is mind is often difficult to differentiate even when we compare a person with broken leg with a person with acute stress reaction. For that reason it might be an over-simplification to differentiate sharply between biological and psychological therapies. The evidence show that psychotherapy influences biology of the brain and that pharmacotherapy influences psychological, social and developmental dimensions of the diseased person as well as overall well-being and functionality. In the era where medicine discovered psychology and psychiatry discovered biology, the debates and divisions that steam out of past dualisms should end. Every practising physician regardless of the medical discipline uses in everyday practice both biological and psychological approaches to help the patient successfully."}, {"Title": "Contemporary psychopharmacotherapy in the context of brave new psychiatry, well-being therapy and life coaching.", "Abstract": "Despite modern advances in clinical psychopharmacology, mental disorders are still the leading cause of disability all over the world.

Lithium treatment results in neutrophilia, increased platelets and increased circulating CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells, HSC. This paper outlines the newly discovered mechanism by which this occurs. Glycogen synthase kinase-3, GSK-3, phosphorylates and thereby inactivates hypoxia-induced factor-1, HIF-1. HIF-1 is a transcription factor triggering transcription of multiple genes related to adaptation to hypoxia, among which is CXCL12. CXCL12 forms the primary homing gradient for CD34+ HSCs towards the hypoxic, trophic bone marrow niche to which they must go to thrive. Lithium inhibits GSK-3 thereby increasing active HIF-1 that results in a stronger CXCL12 homing gradient. Trophic niche function is enhanced, ultimately resulting in increased production of neutrophils, platelets and CD34+ cells. Sitagliptin is a new drug to treat diabetes that coincidentally inhibits destruction of CXCL12. Thus, lithium and sitagliptin enhance CXCL12 by different paths, potentially increasing trophic niche function. Awareness of this path is important in HSC transplantation."}, {"Title": "Mental capacity in psychiatric patients: Systematic review.", "Abstract": "Mental capacity is central to legal and ethical debates on the use of compulsion in psychiatry.\nTo describe the clinical epidemiology of mental incapacity in patients with psychiatric disorders, including interrater reliability of assessments, frequency in the psychiatric population and associations of mental incapacity.\nCross-sectional studies of capacity to consent to treatment for psychiatric patients were systematically reviewed from Medline, EMBASE and PsycInfo databases.

Care giver and patient should be able to express feelings such as frustration, fear and powerlessness, and attention must be paid to those feelings. In order to be able to evaluate the intervention, one has to be aware of the variety of goals the intervention can aim at. One also has to be aware of the variety of methods of intervention, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. Finally, an intervention requires a context of care and responsibility, along with good communication and fair treatment before, during and after the use of coercion and pressure."}, {"Title": "Questioning an axiom: better prognosis for schizophrenia in the developing world?", "Abstract": "That schizophrenia has a better course and outcome in developing countries has become an axiom in international psychiatry. This is based primarily on a series of cross-national studies by the World Health Organization (WHO). However, increasing evidence from other research indicates a far more complex picture.\nLiterature review and tabulation of data from 23 longitudinal studies of schizophrenia outcomes in 11 low- and middle-income countries.\nWe reviewed the evidence about the following domains: clinical outcomes and patterns of course, disability and social outcomes (marital and occupational status, in particular), and untreated samples and duration of untreated psychosis. Outcomes varied across the studies and the evidence suggests a need to reexamine the conclusions of the WHO studies. Additionally, assessments of outcomes should take excess mortality and suicide into account.\nIt is time to reexamine presumed wisdom about schizophrenia outcomes in low- and middle-income countries."}, {"Title": "Emerging paradigms in medicine: implications for the future of psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The causes of mental illness remain obscure in spite of rapid progress in the neurosciences. This is due in part to the fact that contemporary biomedical psychiatry rests on philosophically and scientifically ambiguous ground. In Western medicine paradigms, theories from physics, chemistry, and biology form the basis of an explanatory model of illness, including mental illness. Symptoms are conceptualized as subjective descriptions of effects caused by factors characterized in empirical terms. Conventional biomedicine asserts that all causes of illness, and by extension, mechanisms of action underlying legitimate treatment approaches, rest on biological processes that can be described in the reductionist language of Western science. However, in contemporary Western psychiatry, there is no single adequate explanatory model of the causes of mental illness. What remains are competing psychodynamic, genetic, endocrinologic, and neurobiological models of symptom formation reflecting disparate ideological positions and diverse clinical training backgrounds of mental health professionals. There is no unifying theory in psychiatry because no single explanatory model has been confirmed as more valid than any other. I hypothesize in this article that the synthesis of ideas and clinical approaches from Western biomedicine and non-Western systems of medicine based on understandings of human consciousness, the neurosciences, complexity theory, and quantum field theory, will lead to rapid evolution of conventional Western biomedical psychiatry toward truly integrative mental healthcare. The result will be the emergence of an integrative mental healthcare model that will more adequately address the disparate causes, conditions, and meanings of symptoms combining multimodal approaches from Western biomedicine and non-Western systems of medicine."}, {"Title": "Olfactory identification dysfunction, aggression and impulsivity in war veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.", "Abstract": "Due to neuropsychological conceptualizations of orbitoprefrontal cortex (OFC) dysfunction underpinning impulsive aggression and the incidence of such behaviour in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), this study aimed to explore olfactory identification (OI) ability in war veterans with PTSD as a probe of putative OFC dysfunction; and to explore the utility of OI ability in predicting aggressive and impulsive behavior in this clinical population.\nParticipants comprised 31 out-patient male war veterans with PTSD (mean=58.23 years, s.d.=2.56) recruited from a Melbourne Veterans Psychiatry Unit, and 31 healthy age- and gender-matched controls (mean=56.84 years, s.d.=7.24). All participants were assessed on clinical measures of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and alcohol misuse; olfactory identification; neurocognitive measures of dorsolateral prefrontal, lateral prefrontal and mesial temporal functioning; and self-report measures of aggression and impulsivity.\nWar veterans with PTSD exhibited significant OI deficits (OIDs) compared to controls, despite uncompromised performance on cognitive measures. OIDs remained after covaring for IQ, anxiety, depression and alcohol misuse, and were significant predictors of aggression and impulsivity.\nThis research contributes to emerging evidence of orbitoprefrontal dysfunction in the pathophysiology underlying PTSD. This is the first study to report OIDs as a predictor of aggression and impulsivity in this clinical population. It prompts further exploration of the potential diagnostic utility of OIDs in the assessment of PTSD. Such measures may help delineate the clinical complexity of PTSD, and support more targeted interventions for individuals with a greater susceptibility to aggressive and impulsive behaviors."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry in Austria.", "Abstract": "Austria covers an area of some 84 000 km<sup>2</sup> and has a population of 8.1 million.

The search for peripheral markers reflecting psychiatric disease state and trait has been under constant scrutiny for a few decades and numerous candidates have been tested based on several disease pathogenesis hypotheses. However, the results have often been of poor outcome or not replicable. Recent developments in proteomic and genomic approaches are expanding the number of testable hypotheses by some orders of magnitude and are allowing for the identification of patterns or signatures, rather than single markers, thus creating the premises for a paradigm shift in the search for biomarkers in psychiatry. A series of studies documenting the potential offered by large-scale transcription analyses and proteomic profiling in a number of psychiatric disorders are reported in this review. Specific applications of microarrays to CNS disorders to generate blood-derived disease signatures are discussed.

The objective of this paper was to elucidate these complex issues by comparing various methods for handling missing data (e.g., last observation carried forward [LOCF], completer analysis, propensity-adjusted multiple imputation) and for analyzing outcome (e.g., end-point analysis, repeated-measures analysis of variance [RM-ANOVA], mixed-effects models [MEMs]) using data from a multi-site randomized controlled trial in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The trial compared the effects of 12 weeks of exposure and ritual prevention (EX/RP), clomipramine (CMI), their combination (EX/RP&CMI) or pill placebo in 122 adults with OCD. The primary outcome measure was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. For most comparisons, inferences about the relative efficacy of the different treatments were impervious to different methods for handling missing data and analyzing outcome. However, when EX/RP was compared to CMI and when CMI was compared to placebo, traditional methods (e.g., LOCF, RM-ANOVA) led to different inferences than currently recommended alternatives (e.g., multiple imputation based on estimation-maximization algorithm, MEMs). Thus, inferences about treatment efficacy can be affected by statistical choices. This is most likely when there are small but potentially clinically meaningful treatment differences and when sample sizes are modest. The use of appropriate statistical methods in psychiatric trials can advance public health by ensuring that valid inferences are made about treatment efficacy."}, {"Title": "Clinical holistic medicine: how to recover memory without \"implanting\" memories in your patient.", "Abstract": "Every therapeutic strategy and system teach us the philosophy of the treatment system to the patient, but often this teaching is subliminal and the philosophical impact must be seen as \"implanted philosophy\", which gives distorted interpretations of past events called \"implanted memories\". Based on the understanding of the connection between \"implanted memory\" and \"implanted philosophy\" we have developed a strategy for avoiding implanting memories arising from one of the seven most common causes of implanted memories in psychodynamic therapy: 1) Satisfying own expectancies, 2) pleasing the therapist, 3) transferences and counter transferences, 4) as source of mental and emotional order, 5) as emotional defence, 6) as symbol and 7) from implanted philosophy. Freud taught us that child sexuality is \"polymorphously perverted\", meaning that all kinds of sexuality is present at least potentially with the little child; and in dreams consciousness often go back to the earlier stages of development, potentially causing all kinds of sexual dreams and fantasies, which can come up in therapy and look like real memories. The therapist working with psychodynamic psychotherapy, clinical holistic medicine, psychiatry, and emotionally oriented bodywork, should be aware of the danger of implanting philosophy and memories. Implanted memories and implanted philosophy must be carefully handled and de-learned before ending the therapy. In conclusion \"clinical holistic medicine\" has developed a strategy for avoiding implanting memories."}, {"Title": "Rehospitalization rates of patients with schizophrenia discharged on haloperidol, risperidone or clozapine.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the rehospitalization rates of patients discharged from the Institute of Psychiatry of the Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas of the Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo Medical School while being treated with haloperidol, risperidone or clozapine.\nThis is a naturalistic study designed to monitor rehospitalization rates for patients discharged on haloperidol (n=43), risperidone (n=22) or clozapine (n=31). Time to readmission over the course of three years was measured by the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method. Risk factors associated with rehospitalizations were examined.\nAt 36 months, remained in the community 74% of the haloperidol-treated patients, 59% of the risperidone-treated patients and 84% of the clozapine-treated patients. The haloperidol group showed a higher proportion of women, a late age of onset and shorter length of illness than the other groups, whereas the opposite was observed in the clozapine group.\nThis study suggests that the rehospitalization rates of patients taking clozapine are lower than the rate for patients treated with haloperidol and risperidone.

In this study, we compared psychiatric care at a county psychiatric facility serving a population of 760,000 inhabitants before and after the initiation of this psychiatry residency program.\nMedical charts for all patients admitted to the psychiatric inpatient service during the year before the inception of the psychiatry residency program (2003-2004) and during the first year in which there was full implementation of residents after inception of the psychiatry residency program (2005-2006) were reviewed. Baseline characteristics, demographics, and various outcomes of the two groups were compared.\nAfter the residency program was established, the mean length of stay increased from 8.8 to 9.8 days (p < 0.05), the 30-day readmission rate increased from 3.5% (32/915) to 5.6% (48/853) (p < 0.05), more intramuscular emergency medications were given (p < 0.01), and more radiological assessments were obtained (p < 0.01). However, there was less delay in discharge (p < 0.01) and fewer days without medical necessity (p < 0.01). The patient satisfaction rate dropped from 77% (547/711) to 70% (476/680) (p < 0.01) after initiation of the residency program.\nThe results of this study suggest a statistically significant difference in multiple characteristics of treatment after initiation of a psychiatry residency program in the psychiatric inpatient setting.

However, only recently have in vivo and ex vivo techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in combination with refined animal models and behavioral tests made it possible to identify an emerging pattern of common pathophysiological mechanisms. We now have growing evidence that in both disorders altered interaction of serotonergic and noradrenergic neurons with glutamatergic systems is associated with abnormal neuronal circuits and hyperexcitability. Neuronal hyperexcitability can possibly evoke seizure activity as well as disturbed emotions. Moreover, decreased synaptic levels of neurotransmitters and high glucocorticoid levels influence intracellular signaling pathways such as cAMP, causing disturbances of brain-derived and other neurotrophic factors. These may be associated with hippocampal atrophy seen on Magnetic Resonance Imaging and memory impairment as well as altered fear processing and transient hypertrophy of the amygdala. Positron Emission Tomography studies additionally suggest hypometabolism of glucose in temporal and frontal lobes. Last, but not least, in temporal lobe epilepsy and depression astrocytes play a role that reaches far beyond their involvement in hippocampal sclerosis and ultimately, therapeutic regulation of glial-neuronal interactions may be a target for future research. All these mechanisms are strongly intertwined and probably bidirectional such that the structural and functional alterations from one disease increase the risk for developing the other. This review provides an integrative update of the most relevant experimental and clinical data on temporal lobe epilepsy and its association with depression."}, {"Title": "Cost of disorders of the brain in Ireland.", "Abstract": "The \"Cost of Disorders of the Brain in Europe\" (CBDE) study was conducted by the European Brain Council (EBC) to estimate prevalence and cost of the twelve leading disorders encountered in Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry.

Contrary to these findings, however, only few medical students were willing to specialize in psychosomatic medicine, psychiatry or psychotherapy. Psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic career choices were more frequent in women as well as in students who had experienced psychological distress themselves, and who had undergone psychotherapy, and who were less oriented toward economic success and careers.\nMedical students regarded psychological characteristics as generally interesting and important for medical care, but rarely considered specializing in these medical fields after graduation.

Following the neurosurgical intervention, deterioration of consciousness related to strong vasospasm occurred. Cerebral CT examination was performed, showing a 0.5 cm ischaemic lesion of the left hippocampal fornix. Due to intensive therapy, the patient recovered gradually, however considerable short-time memory deficit and severe anterograde amnesia remained. Admission of the patient in psychiatric care 5 weeks after the operation was necessary since acute deterioration had been added to memory disturbance and anterograde amnesia. Clinical features included severe short-time memory deficit, continuous and severe anterograde amnesia, disorientation, alterations of verbal fluency and abstraction. The amnesic syndrome was probably related to the hippocampal damage, but considering the development of cognitive deficits, cerebral CT was performed again, which verified internal hydrocephalus. A ventriculo-peritoneal shunt has been implanted and the patient was re-admitted in psychiatry care because of her memory deficit, anterograde amnesia and disorientation. Thereafter, low doses of citalopram and donepezil therapy was started together with temporarily used antipsychotic medication (risperidone). Gradual, but continuous improvement of memory and cognitive function could be detected, with total recovery after one year.

To be sure, the third of the great syntheses, Darwin's theory of evolution, remains intact. But otherwise, as far as the eye can see, there is rubble. The time for new attempts at synthesis is now nigh. After decades of pioneering work in the neurosciences, the fundamental importance of brain biology in the human condition has now become evident. Surely one of the new syntheses will draw upon neurochemistry and neurophysiology, and it is to the great credit of the Hungarian neurosciences that pharmacologist Joseph Knoll has now ventured a first attempt.

Such off-label use is a necessary part of the art of psychiatry but brings with it increased responsibilities for the prescriber as, if the patient suffered an adverse reaction, liability would rest with the prescriber and/or their employers. This article reviews the frequency and nature of the off-label prescribing of antipsychotic drugs for psychiatric indications to children, adults and the elderly. It also reviews the evidence base for doing so in a variety of common, and also some less common, clinical situations. The review is mainly concerned with off-label indications but a short section on high dose antipsychotics is also included. The review concludes that the off-label prescription of antipsychotics frequently lacks the support of robust clinical trials. When prescribing off-label, the prescriber must carry out a careful risk assessment of the risks and benefits for the individual patient. They should also inform the patient that the prescription is off-label."}, {"Title": "[Primary care for depression].", "Abstract": "Depressive patients often visit a primary care physician due to various physical symptoms.

Methamphetamine (MAP) abusers are commonly noted as having psychosis, depression and suicidal behavior. The goals of the present study were (i) to investigate relations of clinical correlates, such as gender, drug use behavior, psychiatric comorbidity and psychiatry family history, with suicidal behavior among Chinese MAP abusers; and (ii) to investigate whether there is an association between a polymorphism in the promotor region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) and suicidal behavior among Chinese MAP abusers. A total of 439 MAP abusers from a hospital and detention center in Taipei were interviewed with the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Study and the Family Interview for Genetic Study. The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism was compared between 94 MAP abusers with suicide attempts and 294 MAP abusers without suicide attempts, for whom DNA data were available. The results of the present study indicate that among MAP abusers in Taiwan, suicide attempts were significantly related to female gender, history of MAP-induced psychotic disorder, history of MAP-induced depressive disorder, and family history of psychotic disorders. Among suicide attempters, the attempters with moderate to severe lethality used higher MAP doses than those with minimal to mild lethality. In the present sample the triallelic 5-HTTLPR polymorphism (S, L(G), L(A)) was not associated with MAP-induced depressive disorder, MAP-induced psychotic disorder or suicidal behavior, but studies with larger sample sizes are warranted before excluding the role of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms in suicidal behavior among MAP abusers."}, {"Title": "Delusional disorder: Study from North India.", "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to study sociodemographic profile, clinical parameters including comorbidity, usefulness of antipsychotics especially atypicals, family history, and follow-up rates for delusional disorder.

Several predictors of specialty choice such as: demographics, academic performance, income, social status and personality attributes have been identified. Moreover, the influence of prestige, intellectual content, ability to provide sophisticated technology on preferences of non-primary care specialty has been analyzed. Association between empathy and medical specialty choice has been evaluated.

Furthermore, the surgery residents are more likely to be interested in modern technology, prestige, higher income and to be assertive and extroversive. In addition, students attracted to gynecology like contact with (mostly healthy) patients and express strong believes on reproductive issues. Besides, psychiatry students seem to be sensitive, unstable and impulsive. The analyses of Polish students' attitudes to non-primary care specialties are also presented.

Optimizing the detection of bipolar II disorder in outpatient private practice: toward a systematization of clinical diagnostic wisdom. J. Clin. Psychiatry 66, 914-921]). We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses on such putative bipolar validators as early age at onset of first major depressive episode (before 21 years), high recurrence, family history for bipolar disorders, and depressive mixed states (mixed depression, i.e. depression plus concurrent hypomanic symptoms), in order to identify an MDD subgroup close to BP-II.\nAll bipolar validators were independent predictors of BP-II. Early onset was the only variable which identified an MDD subgroup significantly associated with all bipolar validators. This MDD subgroup was similar to BP-II on age at onset and bipolar family history, and had a high frequency of mixed depression. A dose-response relationship was found between number of bipolar validators present in MDD, and bipolar family history loading among MDD relatives.\nStudy limited to outpatients.\nFrom among the bipolar validators, early age at onset of first major depression (<21 years) was superior to high recurrence (>4 depressive episodes) in identifying an MDD subgroup close to BP-II, which might be subsumed under the broad bipolar spectrum.

Contemporary movement disorder surgery on the brain has evolved from empiric observations on movement behavior after neurological lesions. So too has the development of psychiatric surgical procedures followed the observation of lesions in the brain on cognitive and affective behavior. Just as deep brain stimulation (DBS) has revolutionized the practice of movement disorder surgery, its application to psychiatric illness has become the cutting edge of functional and restorative neurosurgery. The fundamental concept of the cortico-striatal-pallido-thalamocortical loop will be explored in the context of psychiatric disorders. DBS targeting this circuitry appears from initial evidence in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) to be a promising option for patients with neuropsychiatric illness resistant to conventional therapies. Further exploring the anatomic interconnectivity of the physiologically relevant cortical and subcortical areas will inevitably lead to better applications of DBS for the treatment of OCD, major depression (MD) and potentially for other psychiatric disorders. Implementing such therapies optimally will require the creation of treatment centers with specialized expertise in the psychiatric, neurosurgical, and ethical issues that arise with these populations."}, {"Title": "Birth outcomes following prenatal exposure to antidepressants.", "Abstract": "Antidepressant use during pregnancy and the peripartum period is common despite the absence of clear evidence-based guidelines to direct clinical use of these compounds.\nWe compared obstetrical and neonatal outcomes as recorded in medical records among 84 pregnant women with major depressive or anxiety disorders (DSM-IV criteria) who took antidepressants during pregnancy (cases) versus a 2:1 age- and parity-matched control group of 168 unexposed women.

In this paper, 2 cases in which vision was lost (in one patient due to hypophyseal macroadenoma and in the other due to diabetic retinopathy) are presented. The first case is a 35-year-old male referred to the psychiatry department for depressive complaints. He lost his vision due to optic atrophy following multiple surgeries for hypophyseal macroadenoma and visual hallucinations developed afterwards. Ziprasidone 80 mg/day was started and the hallucinations disappeared on the fifth day, but the medication had to be withdrawn because of severe vascular type headaches. Olanzapine 5 mg/day was subsequently used without benefit. He refused further medication and the visions gradually changed into sparkling lights and simple figures at the 7-month follow-up. The second case was a 54-year-old woman with a 20-year history of type-II diabetes mellitus. Visual hallucinations developed after bilateral visual loss due to diabetic retinopathy 4 years earlier. She responded well to treatment with quetiapine 100 mg/day and paroxetine 20 mg/day. Neither of the cases had reported their visual symptoms to their physicians; the second case was diagnosed after 4 years by active screening. Both of the cases had neuroanatomic lesions.

This kind of outpatient involuntary treatment is provided for mental patients suspected to have committed a crime endangering society while in a severe psychotic state. Despite their dangerousness, the Israeli Mental Health Law of 1991 provides outpatient commitment under court order as an alternative to inpatient commitment. This legal provision raises several concerns and important ethical questions. A major dilemma is the question of whether this legal tool is efficacious in stabilizing the mental condition of criminal mental patients in order to prevent the perpetuation of violent crimes in an open setting such as outpatient clinics. Other major concerns are: (a) who bears the responsibility for the implementation of the enforcement? (b) how the enforcement might be implemented? This paper discusses this complex issue and presents some possible solutions aimed at improving the practical use of this important component of the comprehensive modern system of care for mental patients."}, {"Title": "[Carrying out the compulsory orders in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The way a modern society frames its Mental Health Act, especially the clauses pertaining to the compulsory management of those suffering from mental illness, reflects the manner in which it resolves the inherent conflict between the individual's right for personal liberty and dignity and the society's right for safety. The authors review legislation regarding compulsory examination and involuntary hospitalization of individuals suffering from mental illness, of 8 Western countries. The review focuses on both the criteria allowing such compulsory management and the rules that determine how these laws are enforced. In Israel, a Mental Health Act was first enacted in 1955 and then revised in 1991. Both Acts contain clauses establishing the necessary and sufficient conditions for compulsory examination or involuntary hospitalization of persons under emergency or non-emergency circumstances. By requiring more stringent criteria for involuntary confinement, compared with the early Act of 1955, the 1991 Act begins a trend of favoring the individual's rights. Later, as the review reveals, judges in Israel have continued this trend by requiring greater proof of dangerousness and by allowing more room for appeals. To examine issues pertaining to the mechanisms by which compulsory management of persons under the Mental Health Act is carried out, the authors present a retrospective survey on 170 cases of compulsory management, both compulsory examination and involuntary hospitalization, in a three month period in 2005. The results indicate that in 48.3% of cases the orders were carried out after one visit, 71.7% of the cases ended in involuntary hospitalization. Regarding the individuals' response to involuntary confinement, the findings indicate that 43% willfully complied while 7.2% vigorously or violently objected requiring the intervention of the police."}, {"Title": "[Involuntary hospitalization and treatment: the interface between psychiatry and law].", "Abstract": "Involuntary or compulsory hospitalization and treatment of mentally ill patients is one of the most distressing societal needs. The decision to hospitalize or treat an individual involuntarily must balance between three ethical issues: the patient's right to receive medical care, the patient's personal rights to liberty and dignity, and the protection of the public. The psychiatrist is concerned with the need for medical treatment, while the courts follow the letter of the law in order to ensure protection of the individual's rights, as well as those of the public. The interaction between the psychiatric (or medical) discipline and the judicial discipline comprises inherent difficulties, due to these differences in focus of concern and due to the differences in the language they use. In the civil compulsory hospitalization, it is the definition and prediction of dangerousness that comprises a potential discourse and misunderstanding between the psychiatric and the judicial system. It seems that both systems, as well as the patients, may benefit if the initial decision to hospitalize involuntarily is taken by the medical representatives (the District Psychiatrist, Hospital Director, three physicians, etc.) as an emergency procedure. The decision to continue the involuntary hospitalization should be taken by a judicial representative (or a committee), based on the psychiatric evaluation, within 72 hours instead of the 14 days as is currently stated in the Mental Health Law. The less restrictive alternative to hospitalization, compulsory outpatient treatment, is still controversial. This is an order \"with no bite\" and its implementation is determined, in effect, by the patient's goodwill and cooperation. There are no legal or other consequences for patients who do not comply with the outpatient treatment order. This is true for both civil and criminal outpatient orders. Without legal sanctions this model of outpatient treatment is not really \"compulsory\" and does not achieve its preventive goals."}, {"Title": "The Psychiatrists Training Initiative: developing an educational framework for international medical graduates in rural psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to outline challenges and responses in providing a holistic approach to designing and delivering education to international medical graduates (IMGs) undertaking the role of consultant psychiatrists in a rural setting.

Its efficacy has been demonstrated robustly by randomized, controlled clinical trials, with multiple novel brain targets having been discovered in the last 20 years. Multifarious clinical indications for deep brain stimulation now exist, including dystonia and tremor in movement disorders; depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and Tourette's syndrome in psychiatry; epilepsy, cluster headache and chronic pain, including pain from stroke, amputation, trigeminal neuralgia and multiple sclerosis. Current research argues for novel indications, including hypertension and orthostatic hypotension. The development, principles, indications and effectiveness of the technique are reviewed here. While deep brain stimulation is a standard and widely accepted treatment for Parkinson's disease after 20 years of experience, in chronic pain it remains restricted to a handful of experienced, specialist centers willing to publish outcomes despite its use for over 50 years.

The development and implementation of new institutional strategies to reduce the use of seclusion and restraint are important. Although traditional performance improvement (PI) project methodology might seem well-suited to helping managers and administrators identify effective hospital-wide interventions to decrease seclusion and restraint rates, the Logic of the standard PI model precludes managers from making valid inferences about which interventions actually cause change. This article presents a model (derivative of the multiple baseline time-series design with randomization) for testing individual elements of a Large-scale PI project to reduce the use of seclusion and restraint in a behavioral healthcare organization. The proposed model is flexible, accommodates overlapping organizational initiatives, and simultaneously allows for meaningful inferences to be made about the active components of the interventions. The ability to make meaningful inferences is important because, if the initiatives to reduce seclusion and restraint rates work, other healthcare organizations would benefit from knowing Key Words which specific interventions actually Lead engagement model to change and which interventions have multiple baseline design Little impact on secLusion and restraint performance improvement rates.

The purpose of this examination is to consider how the medium of American film portrays psychiatric mental health nursing and its world within the hospital. It critiques the way film frames mental health nursing and the profession's interactions with other disciplines, such as psychiatry, that might reveal a disposition that is peculiar to this group. It concludes that Hollywood film genre continues to perpetuate the notion that mental health nursing occupies an aberrant, secret, and dangerous world and that its role remains one of custodial companionship. If Chiari, Pinel, and Tuke, the founders of moral therapy during the Age of Reason observed these films, they could be forgiven if they wondered whether psychiatric mental nursing remained trapped in the Middle Ages While some of the films reviewed may be considered vacuous nonsense, its discourses reflect how society views people with serious mental illness and those who nurse them. This critique is a challenge for the profession to educate society regarding the profession's true work, reclaiming its commitment to affirming the dignity and human rights of those with mental illness by instigating political strategies that will destabilize the subversive and dividing practices that film merely manipulates."}, {"Title": "What makes psychiatry such a stressful profession?

Despite its capacity to generate solutions to ethical problems, utilitarianism requires a process of what Rawls described as 'reflective equilibrium' to avoid morally repugnant choices, based on utility. The criticisms of utilitarianism, such as the problems of quantifying utility and the responsibility for consequences, are very relevant for psychiatry. Singer's model of utilitarian thinking is particularly problematic for our profession. Kant's ethics provides the pretext for duty bound codes of ethics for psychiatrists, but suffers from problems of flawed claims to the universalizability prescribed by Kant's 'categorical imperative'. Kant's valorization of reason as the core of the autonomy of persons is a valuable insight in understanding psychiatrists' ethical obligations to their patients."}, {"Title": "The DEBIT trial: an intervention to reduce antipsychotic polypharmacy prescribing in adult psychiatry wards - a cluster randomized controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Clinical guidelines advise against prescribing more than one antipsychotic with limited exceptions.

The second patient needed maintenance ECT once a month in order to stay in remission. Whereas ECT is a well-studied and accepted treatment option in adult psychiatry, in child psychiatry people are reluctant to even consider this option. This resistance is partly based on the possible side effects ofECT i.e. memory problems. As a result, the effect ofECT in adolescents has not yet been well studied.

Factor analysis of past hypomania symptoms found three factors: an \"irritable mental overactivity\" factor, an \"elevated mood\" factor, and a \"motor overactivity\" factor. Factor analysis of intradepression hypomanic symptoms in BP-II, and in MDD, found two similar mental and motor overactivity factors. Multivariate regression of the intradepression hypomanic factors versus bipolar validators, such as bipolar family history and young onset age, found significant associations.\nFindings could support the diagnostic validity, and the bipolar nature, of mixed depression, on the basis of the close similarities found between the factor structure of inter-depression hypomania and intra-depression hypomanic symptoms.

The study was conducted in the Department of Psychiatry of the Rumaillah Hospital, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.\nAll Qatari, non-Qatari Arabs, and expatriate patients who were hospitalized with psychotic disorders in the inpatient wards or treated in the outpatient clinics of the Department of Psychiatry over a 7-year period were enrolled in the study. Data were collected from the medical records of patients. The study was conducted from August 1, 1996, to January 1, 2004, amongst the patients with acute and transient psychotic disorders. The diagnostic classification of definite psychotic disorders was made in accordance with criteria based on the International Classification of Disease, 10th revision (ICD-10).\nA total of 174 patients were treated during a 7-year period. Among them, 69% were males and 31% females. No cases were found in children aged less than 15 years. The highest frequency (43.7%) was found in the early adulthood (16-29 years of age). The incidence of acute and transient psychotic disorders was higher in the expatriates (66.7%). More than half (63.8%) of the patients were employed. Most of the cases (35.6%) had acute schizophrenia-like psychotic disorders (F23.2). There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of acute and transient psychotic disorders between males and females, Qatari and non-Qatari Arabs, and single and married.\nThe study found markedly lower incidence rate of acute and transient psychotic disorders in females than males. The highest frequency was found in the early adulthood (16-29 years). No cases were found in children aged less than 15 years.

The subjective experiences of patients with depression.", "Abstract": "The treatment of depression in Australian aged psychiatry units has been found to be effective in terms of symptom improvement and readmission rates. There is little information, however, about how such hospitalization is viewed by the patients themselves. While users' views are increasingly seen as important for the evaluation of mental health services and for improving outcomes, the views of older patients are less likely to be sought. In this study, former patients were asked about their experience of admission, which aspects were helpful and which were not. Negative experiences have been described in an earlier paper. This paper focuses on what study participants considered to be the positive aspects of their time in hospital.\nFifty former patients from three Melbourne hospitals were interviewed in their own homes using a semi-structured, open-ended questionnaire.\nForty-six percent expressed an overall favorable view of their hospital stay; 34% had some reservations; and 20% had a poor overall view. Favorable views did not necessarily preclude distressing incidents or complaints but were associated with the ward environment, experienced as a safe haven; the re-evaluation of negative experiences; and, in most but not all cases, recovery.\nRetrospective accounts are useful for understanding the ways in which hospital experience is processed. Remembering the experience as positive is, in itself, a good therapeutic outcome. In addition, it may influence readiness to seek future treatment, help prevent relapse, and, indirectly, be helpful to others with similar problems."}, {"Title": "The impact of generational change and retirement on psychiatry to 2025.", "Abstract": "Australia is currently experiencing widespread shortages of psychiatrists. The changing nature of the workforce and increasing demand mean that these shortages are unlikely to ease. This study aims to identify demographic change and retirement patterns of the Australian psychiatry workforce from 1995 to 2003, and the implications of those changes for future workforce planning.\nData from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) Medical Labour Force Survey from 1995 to 2003 is used to examine ageing of the psychiatry workforce and attrition of psychiatrists aged 50 years and over. Future attrition from the workforce is projected to 2025.\nSixty two percent of psychiatrists practicing in the year 2000 are predicted to have retired by 2025. Most psychiatrists continue to work until late in life, with only 18 per cent retiring before age 65. The psychiatry workforce aged significantly between 1995 and 2003 (p < 0.001), with men older than women in both years. A reduction in hours worked by psychiatrists reflects both the increasing proportion of females and the older members of the profession reducing their hours in preparation for retirement.\nThe impact of ageing of the workforce may be more immediate for psychiatry than for some other health professions. With the growing proportion of females and their typically lower workforce participation, more than one younger psychiatrist will be required to replace each of the mostly male retirees."}, {"Title": "Predictors of clinical outcome in MCI.", "Abstract": "It remains an open issue in old age psychiatry whether or not persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at increased risk for developing a dementia syndrome, and if so, to what extent and under what circumstances.

In the past 20 years, this has had a number of negative consequences for psychiatry as a medical specialty, which result from the uncertainty of diagnosis and an increasing emphasis on demedicalising services in an attempt to provide social care outside hospital. These changes have probably increased the stigma attached to psychiatric practice and threaten to deskill doctors. They have also meant that services for other disorders do not meet the needs of patients. To continue to allow schizophrenia to be the paradigm condition is against the interests of psychiatrists and their patients."}, {"Title": "The relationship between psychiatry and religion among U.S. physicians.", "Abstract": "This study compared the religious characteristics of psychiatrists with those of other physicians and explored whether nonpsychiatrist physicians who are religious are less willing than their colleagues to refer patients to psychiatrists and psychologists.\nSurveys were mailed to a stratified random sample of 2,000 practicing U.S. physicians, with an oversampling of psychiatrists. Physicians were queried about their religious characteristics. They also read a brief vignette about a patient with ambiguous psychiatric symptoms and were asked whether they would refer the patient to a clergy member or religious counselor, or to a psychiatrist or a psychologist.\nA total of 1,144 physicians completed the survey, including 100 psychiatrists. Compared with other physicians, psychiatrists were more likely to be Jewish (29% versus 13%) or without a religious affiliation (17% versus 10%), less likely to be Protestant (27% versus 39%) or Catholic (10% versus 22%), less likely to be religious in general, and more likely to consider themselves spiritual but not religious (33% versus 19%). Nonpsychiatrist physicians who were religious were more willing to refer patients to clergy members or religious counselors (multivariate odds ratios from 2.9 to 5.7) and less willing to refer patients to psychiatrists or psychologists (multivariate odds ratios from .4 to .6).\nPsychiatrists are less religious than other physicians, and religious physicians are less willing than nonreligious physicians to refer patients to psychiatrists. These findings suggest that historic tensions between religion and psychiatry continue to shape the care that patients receive for mental health concerns."}, {"Title": "Alcohol use disorders, and at-risk drinking in patients affected by a mood disorder, in Cagliari, Italy: sensitivity and specificity of different questionnaires.", "Abstract": "(i) To evaluate the prevalence of alcohol use disorders, and at risk-drinking among outpatients admitted to the Division of Psychiatry, University of Cagliari, Italy, for mood disorders, and (ii) to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaires used.\nFifty-six patients affected by mood disorders answered to the questions of (i) The NIAAA Guide for identification of at-risk drinking, (ii) AUDIT questionnaire, (iii) The CAGE questionnaire and, (iv) SCID-I application forms for mood and alcohol use disorders.\nFourteen subjects (25%) met the criteria for alcohol use disorders according to SCID-I; 17 (30.4%) achieved a score > or = 1 in CAGE questionnaire; 12 (21.4%) reached AUDIT scores of > or =8 and 4 for men and women, respectively; 12 (21.4%) provided positive answers to NIAAA Guide.

False suffocation alarms, spontaneous panics, and related conditions. An integrative hypothesis. Arch Gen Psychiatry; 50:306-17.]. SFA postulates the existence of an evolved physiologic suffocation alarm system that monitors information about potential suffocation. Panic attacks maladaptively occur when the alarm is erroneously triggered. That panic is distinct from Cannon's emergency fear response and Selye's General Alarm Syndrome is shown by the prominence of intense air hunger during these attacks. Further, panic sufferers have chronic sighing abnormalities outside of the acute attack. Another basic physiologic distinction between fear and panic is the counter-intuitive lack of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation in panic. Understanding panic as provoked by indicators of potential suffocation, such as fluctuations in pCO(2) and brain lactate, as well as environmental circumstances fits the observed respiratory abnormalities. However, that sudden loss, bereavement and childhood separation anxiety are also antecedents of \"spontaneous\" panic requires an integrative explanation. Because of the opioid system's central regulatory role in both disordered breathing and separation distress, we detail the role of opioidergic dysfunction in decreasing the suffocation alarm threshold. We present results from our laboratory where the naloxone-lactate challenge in normals produces supportive evidence for the endorphinergic defect hypothesis in the form of a distress episode of specific tidal volume hyperventilation paralleling challenge-produced and clinical panic."}, {"Title": "Stress-induced changes in sleep in rodents: models and mechanisms.", "Abstract": "Psychological stressors have a prominent effect on sleep in general, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in particular.

The current review describes a number of studies that have focused on the impact of stress on sleep in rodent models. The studies are also in Table 1, summarizing the effects of stress in 4-h blocks in both the light and dark phases. Although mild stress procedures have sometimes produced increases in REM sleep, more intense stressors appear to model the human condition by leading to disruptions in sleep, particularly REM sleep. We also discuss work conducted by our group and others looking at conditioning as a factor in the temporal extension of stress-related sleep disruptions. Finally, we attempt to describe the probable neural mechanisms of the sleep disruptions.

Recently it was demonstrated that two proteins involved in dopamine signaling are altered in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of schizophrenic patients. DARPP-32 is a key downstream effector of intracellular signaling pathway and is downregulated in PFC of schizophrenic subjects. NCS-1 is a neuronal calcium sensor that can inhibit dopamine receptor D2 internalization and is upregulated in PFC of schizophrenic subjects. It is well known that dopamine D2 receptor is the main target of antipsychotic. Therefore, our purpose was to study if chronic treatment with typical or atypical antipsychotics induced alterations in DARPP-32 and NCS-1 expression in five brain regions: prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, cortex and cerebellum.

There are many barriers to the diagnosis of catatonia that may explain the low rates of diagnosis in modern psychiatry. This article will review the many barriers that exist in the detection, recognition, and diagnosis of catatonia. Various criteria and rating scales have been applied to catatonia. The lack of precise definitions and validity of catatonia has hindered the detection of catatonia, thus delaying diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

In this cross-sectional study, the medical records of 228 long-term sick-listed patients consecutively referred to a multidisciplinary setting were examined retrospectively. Three specialists in psychiatry, orthopaedic surgery and rehabilitation medicine had made joint rehabilitation recommendations into the four different groups: (i) back to work without rehabilitation; (ii) vocational rehabilitation or adjusted work; (iii) medical rehabilitation and (iv) sick pension. Each patient filled in a pain drawing as a measure of pain extent and the self-administered Montgomery-Asberg-Depression-Rating Scale for evaluating the severity of depressive symptoms. Ninety-five percent of the patients had ongoing pain and 53% had depression. No statistically significant difference was seen between the outcome groups regarding the pain extent. A statistically significant difference was seen between the back to work without any rehabilitation and vocational rehabilitation or adjusted work groups in Montgomery-Asberg-Depression-Rating Scale score versus the medical-rehabilitation and sick-pension groups [P<0.001 between groups (chi(2) test); P<0.05 within groups (Tukey-Kramer Honestly Significant Difference test)]. In conclusion, two-thirds of the patients were assessed to need medical rehabilitation. These patient groups could be separated from the ones who were assessed to be able to go back to work without medical rehabilitation by the severity of the ongoing depression, but not by the pain extent alone.

To date, abnormal asymmetries in the somatosensory region have shown greater specificity, being reported only in psychotic adults. This study examines the functional organization of the somatosensory cortices using magnetoencephalography in adolescents with childhood-onset psychotic disorders. Eighteen young outpatients with history of psychotic illness and 15 healthy adolescents participated. Both groups underwent stimulation of the index finger as magnetoencephalography was acquired from the contralateral hemisphere. Neural generators of the M50 somatosensory response were modeled using an equivalent current dipole for each hemisphere, and later investigated for systematic variation with diagnosis. Consistent with adult psychosis data, adolescent patients showed hemispheric symmetry in the anterior-posterior dimension. In controls, a reversed pattern of hemispheric asymmetry was observed relative to previous findings in normal adults [Reite, M., Teale, P., Rojas, D.C., Benkers, T.L., Carlson, J., 2003. Anomalous somatosensory cortical localization in schizophrenia.

The first modern paper about therapeutic applications of the whole root of rauwolfia was published in 1931 in the Indian Medical Journal by Sen and Bose, and many papers dealing with botanics, chemistry and pharmacology then appeared in Indian and European periodics. In 1949, Vakil published the first report of the antihypertensive effect of rauwolfia in the British Heart Journal. In the Ciba laboratories in Basel, Switzerland, Mueller, Schlittler and Bein analysed various rauwolfia alkaloids and published in 1952 the first complete report about their chemistry and pharmacology. In the same year, reserpine was introduced under the name Serpasil in the treatment of hypertension, tachycardia and thyreotoxicosis. The combination of reserpine, dihydroergocristine and a diuretic is still on the market (Brinerdin, Crystepin). In psychiatry, reserpine was prescribed as a tranqulizing agent until modem synthetic antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs were introduced. The author also briefly summarizes the chemistry, pharmacology and clinical use of reserpine."}, {"Title": "[Influence of psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders on quality of life].", "Abstract": "The term 'quality of life' has received a growing highlight in relation to the care of chronically ill people during the past decades. The main goal of the present study has been to analyze patients' quality of life regarding the following diagnoses: headache (tension headache); mood disorders (depression); anxiety, and comorbid states, involving some psychological variables, such as hostility or social support.\nThere were 157 patients participating in the study who came from a registered patients' pool in the Neuropsychiatric Rehabilitation Ward, Department of Psychiatry, University of Szeged, during the spring semester of 2005. The final sample size contained 151 patients who might be sorted into five main disease groups: mood disorders (depression); anxiety disorders; mixed psychiatric diagnosis; headache; and comorbid diagnosis (headache and psychiatric disorder together). The mean scores of the scales of patients' quality of life were investigated according to gender and disease groups; in addition, we also analyzed the psychological background of the quality of life.\nBased on factor analysis, two factors of the quality of life scale were detected: one factor labelled 'everyday activities' factor (including items such as work, financial situation, nutrition, sexual life or self-actualization), and another one labelled 'social activities' factor (e.g., activities with spouse, family, other persons, religious and community activities). According to the disease groups, differences could be detected particularly in the field of everyday activities; especially patients suffering from mood disorders reported higher levels of deterioration of their quality of life, whereas in comparison with them, patients of headache showed less changes. When there was comorbid psychiatric illness besides headache, a more determinant deterioration of the quality of life could be detected. Hostility and psychosomatic/anxiety symptoms contributed mostly to deterioration of the quality of life in the field of everyday activities, moreover, with growing age, the patients experienced a greater level of deterioration of their quality of life. Among the disease groups, the presence of mood disorder lowered mostly the patients' quality of life. In case of the quality of life factor 'social activities', social support was a protective factor.\nIn this study, we would like to draw the attention to the influences of psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders on patients' quality of life since with this help we may get closer to a deeper understanding of patient behavior. The quality of life study identifies not only the non-beneficial effects but also maps the positive ones. This implies the possibility of effective adaptation."}, {"Title": "[Positron emission tomography: basic principle and radionuclides/probes for metabolic/functional analysis].", "Abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that can non-invasively visualize the distribution and dynamic movement of injected PET probes. In this article, the basic principle of PET technique is briefly explained followed by the introduction of various positron-emitters and PET probes used in clinical and research settings. With the coincidence detection of a pair of annihilation radiation emitted from positron emitters and the attenuation correction technique, PET can afford highly sensitive and quantitative data for analysis. However, spatial resolution of PET is limited and not suitable for detecting small lesions. In addition, PET image lacks anatomical information, and correct anatomical localization of the detected uptake is sometimes difficult. Most positron emitters are produced by cyclotrons and have very short half-lives. Therefore, PET institution should be equipped with an in-house cyclotron to produce positron emitters as well as the facility to prepare PET probes. Using positron emitters such as C-11, N-13 and O-15, functional/physiological molecules such as water, oxygen gas, carbon dioxide gas and ammonia, can be radiolabeled without modifying the structure or behavior, which makes these molecules suitable for the precise evaluation of physiological function and its deviation under pathological conditions. Although 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a marker of glucose metabolism, is the most commonly used PET probe especially in the field of oncology, many PET probes are available to evaluate various important characteristics such as blood flow, metabolism, tumor hypoxia, and neurotransmitter and receptor conditions, and are applied in the fields of oncology, neurology/psychiatry and cardiology."}, {"Title": "The power of the spoken word in life, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis--a contribution to interpersonal psychoanalysis.", "Abstract": "Starting with a 1890 essay by Freud, the author goes in search of an interpersonal psychology native to Freud's psychoanalytic method and to in psychoanalysis and the interpersonal method in psychiatry. This derives from the basic interpersonal nature of the human situation in the lives of individuals and social groups. Psychiatry, the healing of the soul, and psychotherapy, therapy of the soul, are examined from the perspective of the communication model, based on the essential interpersonal function of language and the spoken word: persons addressing speeches to themselves and to others in relations, between family members, others in society, and the professionals who serve them. The communicational model is also applied in examining psychiatric disorders and psychiatric diagnoses, as well as psychodynamic formulas, which leads to a reformulation of the psychoanalytic therapy as a process. A plea is entered to define psychoanalysis as an interpersonal discipline, in analogy to Sullivan's interpersonal psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Nonpharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia].", "Abstract": "The purpose of this manuscript is to briefly describe the main modalities of non-pharmacological therapy and its utilization on the chronic insomnia treatment. Insomnia is the most frequent sleep disorder and that is more associated with psychiatry disorders. The pharmacotherapy is the most frequent treatment, but the nonpharmacologic therapy has been studied. The most common therapy modalities include behavioral approaches, stimulus control, sleep restriction, paradoxical intention, sleep hygiene, progressive muscle relaxation and biofeedback and, more recently, physical exercise practices. At first behavioral therapy aimed to improve sleep quality, however, recent studies have been emphasizing the effect of behavioral and cognitive approaches on quality of life, on decrease of dosage and frequency of drugs intake.

Such studies must be strictly monitored in order to assure compliance with the regulations, as well as with the standards of patient safety. Clear agreement among the investigator, the sponsor and the institution carrying out the study must be previously defined in order to avoid any conflicts of interest during or after the study. Operational aspects, such as the time needed to gain regulatory approval of the study design, strategies for patient recruitment/retention and appropriate logistics, are also important. In 2005, the Brazilian National Clinical Research Network was established, bringing together a number of research centers in teaching hospitals. The objective was to subsidize public clinical research with state-of-the-art practices and appropriate technical/scientific training programs. The development of research protocols that prioritize public health care needs in Brazil is other fundamental goal of this network. This article addresses general aspects of clinical research, as well as some specific issues in psychiatry.

Pre-clinical studies of modafinil suggest a complex profile of neurochemical and behavioral effects, distinct from those of amphetamine. In addition, modafinil shows initial promise for a variety of off-label indications in psychiatry, including treatment-resistant depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. Cognitive dysfunction may be a particularly important emerging treatment target for modafinil, across these and other neuropsychiatric disorders. We aimed to comprehensively review the empirical literature on neurochemical actions of modafinil, and effects on cognition in animal models, healthy adult humans, and clinical populations. We searched PubMed with the search term 'modafinil' and reviewed all English-language articles for neurochemical, neurophysiological, cognitive, or information-processing experimental measures. We additionally summarized the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil and clinical efficacy in psychiatric patients. Modafinil exhibits robust effects on catecholamines, serotonin, glutamate, gamma amino-butyric acid, orexin, and histamine systems in the brain. Many of these effects may be secondary to catecholamine effects, with some selectivity for cortical over subcortical sites of action. In addition, modafinil (at well-tolerated doses) improves function in several cognitive domains, including working memory and episodic memory, and other processes dependent on prefrontal cortex and cognitive control. These effects are observed in rodents, healthy adults, and across several psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, modafinil appears to be well-tolerated, with a low rate of adverse events and a low liability to abuse. Modafinil has a number of neurochemical actions in the brain, which may be related to primary effects on catecholaminergic systems. These effects are in general advantageous for cognitive processes. Overall, modafinil is an excellent candidate agent for remediation of cognitive dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "AACAP 2005 Research Forum: speeding the adoption of evidence-based practice in pediatric psychiatry.", "Abstract": "At the 2005 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), the Academy's Workgroup on Research conducted a Research Forum entitled \"Increasing Research Literacy Through the Adoption of Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) in Pediatric Psychiatry.\"\nForum participants focused on speeding the adoption of EBP across five areas: EBP as the preferred heuristic for teaching research literacy, use of EBP in training programs, dissemination of EBP in clinical practice, EBP in partnership with industry, and EBP as a framework for developing practice guidelines.\nEBP provides an easy-to-understand method for accessing and evaluating the research literature and then applying this information to decisions about patient care. Although EBP has been gaining greater visibility in pediatric psychiatry, it is far from the preferred heuristic. To move the field toward fully embracing EBP will require greater understanding of what EBP is (and is not), educating mental health professionals in EBP skills, access to EBP resources, and a commitment to apply EBP to the conceptualization and design of research protocols and practice guidelines.\nPediatric psychiatry would benefit from a principled commitment to follow other areas of medicine in adopting EBP."}, {"Title": "Comparison of personality risk factors in bulimia nervosa and pathological gambling.", "Abstract": "The objective of the study was to assess the predictive value of personality profiles to classify individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN), pathological gambling (PG), and a nonpsychiatric comparison group while controlling for sex.\nThe sample comprised 270 BN (241 women, 29 men), 429 PG (42 women, 387 men), and 96 comparison (nonpsychiatric) subjects (35 women, 61 men).

To date, it has been translated into 25 languages, and validated in 10. The present Hungarian version provides the most complete external validation across the Beck Depression Scale (BDI), Profile of Mood States (POMS), the BarOn Emotional Quotient Inventory (BarOn EQ-i), Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), and the NEO Personality Inventory - Revised (NEO-PI-R). We were particularly interested in concurrent validation against the TCI and the NEO-PI-R, the most important of the new personality instruments.\n1132 clinically-well subjects (27% male) from the general population and university students (16-81 years) were administered the above scales and instruments. The data were tested with standard psychometric batteries.\nFactor analysis revealed 5 factors approximating the original D, C, I, H, and A subscales, which in their superfactor confirmed an Emotional (D, C, I, A) vs. Hyperthymic structure. Except for the D (a=0.65), the Cronbach alpha for the remainder temperaments ranged from 0.75-0.81. Dominant temperaments ranged from the I (2.7%) to the C (4.2%); the highest prevalence was observed among men with C=6% and H=5.4%. The BDI and POMS correlated significantly with the relevant subscales, as did the BarOn. Of the many significant possible correlations with the TCI, the most noteworthy were novelty seeking and harm avoidance with D, A, C, as well as C, and persistence with H. As for the NEO-PI-R, we were struck by the positive correlation of openness with C, and conscientiousness negatively with C; most other positive correlations such as neuroticism with all temperaments but the hyperthymic were expected and strongly supportive of concurrent validity.\nHigher educational background of the subjects studied relative to that of the general population of Hungary. The distribution of the data may have in some instances deviated somewhat from the underlying assumptions for the standard psychometric tests for normality. We did not conduct test-retest reliability.\nThe factorial structure of the TEMPS-A shows good reliability and internal consistency. Although the superstructure is reminiscent of neuroticism-extraversion, within it are embedded discernible classical affective temperaments. A provocative finding is the high prevalence of cyclothymia in Hungarian males (6%), which is rather unique when compared with the other 10 countries studied to date. This finding, coupled with high male hyperthymia (5.4%), may explain the high lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorders reported from Hungary.

This development fundamentally changed the child psychiatrist's profession and its identity.\nTo investigate the specific features that are required in current child and adolescent psychiatry.\nIn this article we will clarify the change in the child psychiatrist's profession and identity by outlining how child an adolescent psychiatry evolved as from the early 1980s. We will do this by concentrating on the diagnostic process. The treatment aspect will be discussed only briefly.\nOver the last 25 years the role of the child psychiatrist has undoubtedly changed. From being mainly a diagnostician and/or being personally responsible for treating the child or adolescent the child psychiatrist has become increasingly the person who controls the diagnostic process and plans treatment.\nOver the last two decades the diagnostic technique of the child psychiatrist has developed in a new direction. The child psychiatrist has chosen instead to elucidate a patient's referral and to discuss the reasons for a request for assistance and/or care. The psychiatrist uses many types of information and a multitude of informants and methods.

Strategies have been introduced to attempt to identify individuals in the prepsychotic or prodromal phase. The most widely used of these approaches is the ultra-high risk (UHR) approach, which combines known trait and state risk factors for psychotic disorder. However, researchers guided by phenomenological theory have argued that modern psychiatry's neglect of subjective experience has compromised researchers' understanding of psychotic disorder and has thereby limited efforts at prospective and early identification. Phenomenological research indicates that disturbance of the basic sense of self may be a core marker of psychotic vulnerability, particularly of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. It is argued that identifying self-disturbance in the UHR population may provide a means of further \"closing in\" on individuals truly at high risk of psychotic disorder, thus supplementing the UHR identification approach. This would be of practical value in the sense of reducing inclusion of \"false-positive\" cases in UHR samples and of theoretical value in the sense of shedding light on core features of psychotic pathology. The strong explanatory power and empirical findings to date invite further research into the role of self-disturbance as a phenotypic vulnerability marker for psychotic disorder."}, {"Title": "Combined medical-psychiatric inpatient units: evaluation of the Centre for the Elderly.", "Abstract": "Considering the large number of elderly patients in acute hospitals who receive medical as well as psychiatric treatment because of relevant comorbidity, adequate interdisciplinary treatment models have to be developed and applied.

In addition to traditionally structured units, the centre consists of interdisciplinary units. Patient-, staff- and hospital-related characteristics influenced by the reformation of both departments were evaluated by comparing hospital-based registry data records containing age, gender, main and minor diagnoses, length of stay and patient transferrals within the centre. Experts working at the centre were asked to take a stand on the development of the treatment quality, allocation of patients, diagnostic procedures, consultation services and information transmission. The number of admissions to the Centre for the Elderly increased within one year. The distribution of the main diagnose groups remained unchanged, with an overlap between the geriatric and psychogeriatric department consisting of the main diagnoses dementia and depression. The length of stay and the number of transferrals decreased significantly in both departments.

Prior to initiating antipsychotic therapy, the psychiatrist should not only explain to the patient the risks of the medication and alternative treatments, but also address preventive strategies and the importance of monitoring. To help evaluate the patient's response and manage SGA-related adverse effects, the psychiatrist should spend considerable time in contact with the patient, the patient's family and/or caregivers (as appropriate), and the patient's primary care physician.

Duke Friedrich August, the heir to the throne of the German kingdom of Saxony, submitted a separately recorded special vote (or, very roughly speaking, a brief) that denied the criminal responsibility of the murderer since he had committed his crime out of jealousy and in an emotionally agitated state of mind that eliminated the offender's free will. Though possessing no relevant professional training, the duke applied, and argued in support of, a syndrome - partial mania - that was then the subject of ongoing controversy in general psychiatry.

Several major themes and salient statements were identified from a qualitative analysis.\nAnalysis identified several multifaceted factors, including a difficult and pressured work environment and lack of resources due to chronic underfunding; perceived deficiency of personal skills, such as empathy; inadequate income; negative implications of stigma, low prestige, and limited patient gratitude and job satisfaction. These issues, coupled with the widespread belief that the discipline is unscientific and not \"real medicine\", may contribute to later decisions not to pursue training in psychiatry.\nWhile the framing of the research question was biased towards eliciting negative evaluations of a career in psychiatry, the responses are nonetheless instructive in helping to understand the reasons why potential trainees might be discouraged from the field. If psychiatry is to attract high-quality recruits, there is clearly a need to address stigmatizing attitudes within the medical hierarchy, and provide positive educational experiences for medical students that excite their imagination about a career or even a calling - as against its negative 'job' status."}, {"Title": "Is there a role for psychiatry in late termination of pregnancy?", "Abstract": "The aim of the present review was to explore the role of the psychiatrist in late terminations of pregnancy. A literature review was conducted using MEDLINE and psycINFO databases, focussing on articles that explored (i) existing decision-making processes in late terminations; (ii) psychological sequelae of both early and late termination of pregnancy; (iii) the role of psychiatry in both early and late termination of pregnancy; and (iv) the involvement of psychiatry in complex medical decisions. The decision to perform a late termination of pregnancy is complex. Contributing to its complexity is an array of political, legal, societal, and ethical factors. The literature regarding psychological sequelae is frequently confusing and weakened by methodological problems. Methods of assisting in this decision-making process include the involvement of committees and psychiatrists. There are precedents for the involvement of psychiatrists in such a setting. Historically, psychiatrists played a role in screening women who requested an early termination. Psychiatrists are often involved in ethically challenging and complex clinical decisions in the general hospital setting. The involvement of psychiatry in this complex decision-making process has potential advantages and disadvantages. It is timely for psychiatrists to consider their position on their discipline's involvement."}, {"Title": "Integrating general health care in private community psychiatry practice.", "Abstract": "Patients with chronic mental illness have multiple health care needs.

These factors, and turf and financial motivations associated with the rise of \"biological psychiatry,\" are discussed because they impact the practice of clinical hypnosis and psychotherapy.

These clinical trials increasingly incorporate placebo-controlled conditions as part of their paradigms and may even involve an element of deception. In contrast, the therapeutic effects of hypnosis do not require deception. As researchers begin to identify genetic and neural correlates of hypnotizability, these findings may further elucidate placebo phenomena.

The diagnostic tools C-L psychiatrists are usually provided with may reveal to be limited because of particular psychosomatic syndromes and subthreshold psychopathology that are undetected by psychiatric diagnostic criteria. The Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR) were developed with the aim of providing clinicians with operational criteria for psychosomatic syndromes to overcome the limitations shown by the most often diagnosed disorders in medical settings as adjustment, somatoform, mood, and anxiety disorders. In a group of 66 consecutive C-L psychiatry inpatients, a consistent prevalence of 71% DCPR syndromes was found, particularly secondary functional somatic symptoms, persistent somatization, health anxiety, and demoralization. Their overlap rates with DSM-IV diagnoses showed that the DCPR syndromes were able to identify psychological dimensions (as somatic symptom clustering, anxiety triggered by the current health status, and a feeling state of hopelessness) that do not meet or are not detected by DSM-IV. Furthermore, the DCPR syndromes identified patients with clinically significant functional impairment.

Focus on psychotropic drugs.", "Abstract": "In recent years there has been increasing focus on the role of the drug transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) with regard to drug penetration into the brain. Studies using mice devoid of functional P-gp have revealed that P-gp at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) can exert a profound effect on the ability of some drugs to enter the brain, e.g. cardiovascular drugs (digoxin, quinidine), opioids (morphine, loperamide, methadone), HIV protease inhibitors, the new generation of antihistamines, and some antidepressants and antipsychotics. Among the latter group, risperidone is strongly influenced having about 10 times higher cerebral concentration in P-gp knock-out mice than in control mice. Taking into account that polytherapy is commonplace in psychiatry, theoretically there is a risk of drug-drug interactions with regard to P-gp at the BBB. Here we review the evidence for a role of P-gp with regard to psychoactive drugs from in vitro studies and experiments in knock-out mice devoid of functional P-gp. Moreover, the evidence for significant drug-drug interactions involving psychotropic drugs in rodents is considered. Clinical observations suggesting a role for P-gp in relation to drug-drug interactions at the BBB are sparse, and a definite conclusion awaits further studies. Also, the possible clinical relevance of P-gp genetic polymorphisms is questionable, and more investigations are needed on this subject."}, {"Title": "Outbreak management and implications of a nosocomial norovirus outbreak.", "Abstract": "Noroviruses are enterically transmitted and are a frequent cause of gastroenteritis, affecting 23 million people annually in the United States.

Accurate measurement of these phenomena requires repeated measures, and ideally needs to be performed in the patient's natural environment rather than in an artificial laboratory environment or a protected hospital environment. The usual paper and pencil questionnaires do not meet these two conditions for reasons of logistics. A recently developed method, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), made it possible to implement these field assessments via ingenious use of various devices (most frequently an electronic diary) coupling an auditory signal with computerized data capture. The subject carries the device with him/her at all times, and data is recorded in vivo in real time. The programming of repeated measures in the form of a Likert scale or pull-down menu is easily achieved. A recall alarm system can help increase compliance. Compared with classical self-report, EMA improves the validity of the assessment of certain symptoms, which are the main evaluation criteria in clinical trials concerning certain pathologies (e.g., craving and treatment of addiction), where measurement was previously liable to bias. This article sets out to present this method, its advantages and disadvantages, and the interest it presents in psychiatry, in particular via three original applications developed by the authors including: measurement of reaction time without the knowledge of the subject in order to test certain cognitive models; use of a graphic solution for the data recorded for functional analysis of disorders; and the use of data collection via mobile phone and text messages, which also enables therapeutic interventions in real time by text messages, personalized on the basis of the situational data collected (e.g., in the case of craving, the associated mood, solitary or group consumption or concomitant occupations)."}, {"Title": "Quetiapine use for the treatment of manic episode during pregnancy.", "Abstract": "The foregoing is a case report about a 30-year-old woman, who was referred to our psychiatry clinic with a clinical picture of manic episode, at the 21st week of her first pregnancy.

The goal of this study was to look into the related effect of environmental factors (daily hassles, life events, and social support) on perceived mental health and on the initiation and consumption of tobacco and alcohol by preadolescents.\nThe study was carried out in 12 institutions in a French department (\"Indre-et-Loire\") in the \"R\u00e9gion Centre\", including students from the last year of primary school (fifth grade) and the first two years of middle school (sixth and seventh grades): all nine elementary schools in Jou\u00e9-l\u00e8s-Tours, the second largest city of the department, and three middle schools in Tours and surrounding areas (urban, semi-rural and inner city). The sample was made up of 476 preadolescents attending school, 234 girls (49%) and 242 boys (51%), 267 primary school and 209 middle school students, with an average age of 11 years and 7 months.\nStandardized questionnaires, specific to this population: with a scale of daily hassles, life events, mental health, and social support, were used. They proved to be adapted to each of them (Cronbach alpha coefficient>0.70) and the types of hassles and life events corresponded to the psycho developmental knowledge specific of this period. For the middle school students, dependence on tobacco was defined according to the \"Hooked on nicotine checklist\".\nIn April 2004 in class (anonymity guaranteed).\nThe results show that the hassles (considered in terms of occurrence or intensity, that is, the perceived stress) and life events (occurrence and negative perception) have a negative effect on mental health. In particular, pressure due to family problems has the greatest influence on mental health. For primary school students, this is followed by problems linked to self-perception; for middle school students, those linked to school. The consequences of hassles and life events on mental health allowed us to verify the solidity of the model used in previous studies [the Lausanne pediatric psychiatry team ], even with a younger preadolescent population. The effect of daily hassles is greater than that of life events, but they are not independent of one another (mediational model). Social support plays a modulating and protective role in mental health and the effects of daily hassles and life events. The prevalence of preadolescent smokers (simple experimentation or more or less regular use) is 5.7% (n=26). The prevalence of alcohol use is greater, encompassing more than one-third of subjects (33.4%; n=153). The influence of daily hassles can be seen both on the age of initiation to alcoholic beverages and to use of alcohol and intoxications. It is also observed on the age of initiation to tobacco and nicotine dependence (only taken into account for middle school students). That is to say that they promote precocity in the consumption of these products and increase their use. The absence of links with tobacco consumption may be due to the low number of preadolescent tobacco users. Life events also show an effect on tobacco and alcohol consumption, but it is lesser and should be moderated. Mental health is also correlated (but weakly) to the use of alcoholic beverages and intoxications. This applies more specifically to middle school students. Finally, the role of social support cannot be distinguished.\nThis study shows the degree that daily hassles impact mental health and the recourse to psychoactive substances during preadolescence. Precocious use of tobacco and alcohol, the abuse of these substances and occasionally the beginning of dependence should be considered, at the very least, as warning signs for states of tension on individual, familial and environmental levels, or even as signs of established problems which could be revealed through a thorough clinical."}, {"Title": "[Dimensional approach of emotion in psychiatry: validation of the Positive and Negative Emotionality scale (EPN-31)].", "Abstract": "This paper reports the first validation study of the EPN-31 scale (Positive and Negative Emotionality scale, 31 items) in a French psychiatric sample. This questionnaire has been adapted by Rolland from an emotion inventory developed by Diener, and is also in accordance with Watson and Clark's tripartite model of affects.\nRespondents were asked to rate the frequency with which they had experienced each affect (31 basic emotional states) during the last month. The answer format was a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 \"Not experienced at all\" to 7 \"Experienced this affect several times each day\". Three main scores were calculated (positive affects, negative affects, and surprise affects), as well as six sub-scores (joy, tenderness, anger, fear, sadness, shame). Four hundred psychiatric patients were included in this study, and completed the EPN-31 scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale. The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale was rated, as well as DSM IV diagnostic criteria. We performed a principal component analysis, with Varimax orthogonal transformation, and explored the factorial structure of the questionnaire, the internal consistency of each dimension, and the correlations between EPN-31 scores and HAD scores.\nThe factorial structure of the EPN-31 was well-defined as expected, with a three-factor (positive, negative and surprise affects) solution accounting for 58.2% of the variance of the questionnaire. No correlation was obtained between positive and negative affects EPN-31 scores (r=0.006). All alpha Cronbach coefficients were between 0.80 and 0.95 for main scores, and between 0.72 and 0.90 for sub-scores. GAF scores were significantly correlated with EPN-31 positive affects scores (r=0.21; p=0.001) and with EPN-31 negative affects scores (r=- 0.45; p=0.001). We obtained significant correlations between positive affects score and HAD depression score (r=- 0.45; p<0.001), and between negative affects score and HAD anxiety (r=0.56; p<0.001) and depression (r=0.45; p<0.001) scores. This pattern of correlation was in accordance with the Watson tripartite model of emotionality. Significantly higher EPN-31 positive affect mean scores were observed in females when compared to males (p<0.001). The third factor of the EPN-31 is less robust than the others and, the validity of the surprise score could hence be discussed.\nIn all, this study confirmed the validity and the interest of the EPN-31 use in psychiatric patients. Various clinical and research applications can be considered, such as infra-symptomatic studies of emotions in affective disorders and during treatment protocols or definition of phenotypic markers in genetic or neuro-imagery studies."}, {"Title": "[Efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in major depression: a review].", "Abstract": "In 1985, Barker et al. showed that it was possible to stimulate both nerves and brain using external magnetic stimulation without significant pain. During the past 10 years, therapeutic effects of repeated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) have been widely studied in psychiatry and its efficacy has been demonstrated in the treatment of major depressive disorders, particularly as an alternative to electroconvulsivotherapy (ECT). Facing the large range of studies, we found necessary to propose an up-to-date review in French of the methodological and therapeutic variations among them.\nBased on an exhaustive consultation of Medline data and the Avery-George-Holtzheimer Database of rTMS Depression-Studies, supplemented by a manual research, only works evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS on depressive symptoms were retained, excluding all studies exclusively investigating the stimulation parameters or the tolerance as well as case reports.\nOut the 66 available reports we retained 30 studies. After a description of the main results of these 30 studies, several elements of the 66 will be discussed. Open studies demonstrated that short courses rTMS (5 to 10 sessions) produced a decrease in the mean Hamilton Depression Ratting Scale (HDRS) scores, although significant remission of depression in individuals was rare. Most authors had used high frequency rTMS applied to the left Dorso Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (left DLPFC). However, low frequency rTMS applied to the right DLPFC was also followed by significant reduction of HDRS scores. Parallel arm, double blind versus placebo studies are designed to clarify the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS therapy but conclude in contradicting results. Literature data globally confirms a greater efficacy of rTMS compared to placebo (37% responders in the active group vs 20% in the sham). This efficacy could in fact be even greater because the sham procedure is disputable in most studies. Indeed, positioning rTMS coil at 45 or 90 from the scalp may not represent an accurate sham procedure and the use of real sham coil is to be recommended. Only one study has suggested that associating rTMS and ECT could decrease the number of general anesthesia required. Therapeutic efficacy has been shown by either inhibiting the right DLPFC or by stimulating the left DLPFC, although some patients exhibit paradoxical responses. High frequency rTMS (>5 Hz) increases cortical excitability and metabolism, while low-frequency rTMS stimulation ( 1 Hz) has the opposite effect. Other parameters are: relevant: intensity (from 80 to 110% of motor threshold), total number of stimulations (from 120 to 2 000) and total number of rTMS sessions (from 5 to 20). As suggested in most recent studies, higher-intensity pulses, higher number of stimulation or longer treatment courses may be more effective. Greater responsiveness to rTMS may be predicted by several patients' factors, including the absence of psychosis, younger age and previous response to rTMS therapy.\nConclusions on these factors and others, such as the importance of anatomically accurate coil placement and the distance from the coil to the brain, await further investigation. Despite heterogeneity of these reports according to methodology and treatment parameters, the antidepressive properties of rTMS now appear obvious, opening interesting prospects, in particular in the treatment of pharmacoresistant major depressive patients and, we hope, administered as adjuvant therapy in non-resistant depression.\nThus, many questions remain unanswered concerning the optimal stimulation parameters, privileged indications and maintenance sessions. This justifies the development of structured evaluation trials on larger samples."}, {"Title": "Substance abuse and dependence treatment in outpatient physician offices, 1997-2004.", "Abstract": "To examine patient, physician, and visit characteristics associated with treatment for substance abuse during outpatient physician visits.\nSecondary data was obtained from the 1997-2004 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.\nA substance abuse diagnosis was recorded in .9% of general and family practice visits, .8% of internal medicine visits, and 5.1% of psychiatry visits.

The first method is an ancient yogic technique called unilateral forced nostril breathing (UFNB) that employs forced breathing through only one nostril while closing off the other. The second method works by stimulation of an autonomic reflex point on the fifth intercostal space near the axilla. The most recent method employs unilateral vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) via the mid-inferior cervical branch and requires surgical implantation of a wire and pacemaker. UFNB is non-invasive and seems to selectively activate the ipsilateral branch of the sympathetic nervous system with a possible compensation effect leading to contralateral VNS. UFNB and VNS have been employed to treat psychiatric disorders. While UFNB has been studied for its potential effects on the endogenous ultradian rhythms of the autonomic and central nervous system, and their tightly coupled correlates, VNS has yet to be studied in this regard.

Despite being the most common method of homicide/suicide in youth, gun access was assessed by residents in only 3% of patients. Domestic violence was endorsed as positive 100% of the time when it was documented. Pediatric patients presenting with violence were more likely to be screened for past violence than those with suicide and other complaints.

The concept of melancholia as a specific subtype of a broader illness known as \"depressive disorder\" is fairly recent in modern psychiatry, arising predominantly in Great Britain and becoming a formal part of mood disorder nosology in 1980 with the DSM-III.

Due to these factors, marginal progress has been achieved in the past as many features of serious mental illness remain untouched by existing treatments. Arguably, the most important of these drug targets is cognitive dysfunction, which strongly predicts clinical outcome in a number of major neuropsychiatric conditions. Therefore, a critical need exists for progress in the characterization of this and other targets for drug discovery and development. A key area, which is already showing promise, is the use of non-invasive functional neuroimaging to investigate both cognitive dysfunction and its remediation with novel agents. In this article, the authors describe the paradigmatic case of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia, and the prospects for using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effects of agents targeting cognition. The authors observe a number of advantages of this approach over other methodologies, as well as some significant issues to be resolved in the application of this technology.

Recognition of chemical mediation at the site of the synapse, followed by the introduction of the spectrophotofluorimeter first, and receptor assays subsequently, led to the demonstration that chlorpromazine blocks dopamine receptors. Treatment with chlorpromazine focused attention on the heterogeneity of schizophrenia in terms of responsiveness to treatment.

The vast majority of psychiatrists treating depressed patients do not target or treat nicotine dependence, and many inpatient psychiatric facilities implicitly condone smoking by providing 'smoke breaks'. The reasons for failure to treat are unclear, but are probably linked to the notion that depressed smokers are neither willing nor able to quit, and will become more depressed if they try. We review the clinical evidence on depression and smoking cessation, and find little support for current psychiatric practice. Although quitting smoking does appear to pose a risk for the development of depression, this risk is not clearly higher in those with a past history of depression than those without. Depressed smokers are as capable as nondepressed smokers of quitting smoking, and at least one-quarter of depressed smokers is willing to try.

In suicide attempters with mood disorder, the non-suppressor status in the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) is associated with suicide indicating that HPA-axis hyperactivity is a biological risk factor for suicide and may be a useful predictor. The threshold of 5 microg/dl for cortisol levels measured at 08:00 a.m. or 4:00 p.m. following dexamethasone at 11:00 p.m. to define the DTS nonsuppression was derived as being optimal for the separation of melancholia and nonmelancholic conditions rather than the prediction of suicide. A different threshold may offer a better identification of suicide. The aim of this study was to find the optimal threshold level of post DST plasma cortisol at 4 p.m. for suicide prediction using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. A cohort of 106 depressed inpatients with an index suicide attempt admitted to the department of Psychiatry at the Karolinska University Hospital between 1980 and 2000, were submitted to DST and followed up for causes of death. During the follow-up (mean 17 years), 25 suicides (24%) were identified. The ROC analysis revealed that a lower threshold of 3.3 microg/dl for the nonsuppressor status predicted 17 of 25 suicides (sensitivity of 68%) compared with 15 of 25 suicides (sensitivity 60%) with a conventional threshold of 5 microg/dl at 4:00 p.m. In male suicide attempters the lower threshold for pathological DST result (3.3 microg/dl) changed the Odds ratio from 6.7 till 18.

Self perturbations are not a part of diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, nevertheless they are implicitly considered as part of the clinical picture.

These 4 systems resemble classic nosological approaches based upon the 'outcome principle' concept, which suggests that schizophrenia leads to deterioration. However, diagnostic effectiveness of neuropsychological tests for the 23 operationalized diagnostic systems of schizophrenia was low (likelihood ratio <2).\nNeuropsychological functioning provides empirical validation to operationalized definitions of schizophrenia which are mainly based upon deterioration.

A major thrust towards community care has been the development of community mental health teams (CMHT).\nTo evaluate the effects of community mental health team (CMHT) treatment for anyone with serious mental illness compared with standard non-team management.\nWe searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2006). We manually searched the Journal of Personality Disorders, and contacted colleagues at ENMESH, ISSPD and in forensic psychiatry.\nWe included all randomised controlled trials of CMHT management versus non-team standard care.\nWe extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, based on a fixed effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a fixed effects model.\nCMHT management did not reveal any statistically significant difference in death by suicide and in suspicious circumstances (n=587, 3 RCTs, RR 0.49 CI 0.1 to 2.2) although overall, fewer deaths occurred in the CMHT group. We found no significant differences in the number of people leaving the studies early (n=253, 2 RCTs, RR 1.10 CI 0.7 to 1.8). Significantly fewer people in the CMHT group were not satisfied with services compared with those receiving standard care (n=87, RR 0.37 CI 0.2 to 0.8, NNT 4 CI 3 to 11). Also, hospital admission rates were significantly lower in the CMHT group (n=587, 3 RCTs, RR 0.81 CI 0.7 to 1.0, NNT 17 CI 10 to 104) compared with standard care. Admittance to accident and emergency services, contact with primary care, and contact with social services did not reveal any statistical difference between comparison groups.\nCommunity mental health team management is not inferior to non-team standard care in any important respects and is superior in promoting greater acceptance of treatment. It may also be superior in reducing hospital admission and avoiding death by suicide.

Quantitative assessment of the frequency of normal associations in the utterances of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Schizophrenia Research 78, 219-224] shows that schizophrenia patients produce an elevated rate of normative thought associations in verbal utterances as measured by an objective computerized procedure. An important theoretical question concerns whether such an elevated rate of associative activity is due merely to psychosis, or can it be found in schizotypic subjects with no prior history of psychosis.\nWe hypothesized that schizotypic features should be correlated with associative performance, especially the positive symptom-like schizotypic features. The present study examined associative performance in psychometrically-identified schizotypic subjects (n=25) and normal control (n=29) subjects. We studied individual differences in schizotypal personality features in relation to the associative performance index.\nLevel of normative associations was correlated with total schizotypic features, particularly those involving reality distortion and disorganization. Regression analysis revealed higher levels of disorganization features and lower levels of negative schizotypal features uniquely accounted for variation in the associative performance index. Partial correlation analysis suggested that the negative schizotypic features dimension may function as a suppressor variable moderating the relationship between disorganization and level of normative associations.\nDisorganization-related schizotypal features among individuals with no prior history of psychosis are correlated with elevated levels of normative associations. This relationship is most likely moderated by negative schizotypic features. These data support the presence of hyperassociative processes in those deemed to be at elevated risk for schizophrenia (or, more broadly perhaps, psychosis).

Respondents completed a self-administered instrument (20 brief case studies, and a personality inventory) at the end of a lecture. Participation was voluntary and unpaid.\nMS would recommend psychotropic drugs in 40% of the 20 cases, PS in 27%. MS who would prescribe psychotropic medication differed in personality profile from PS. MS with a tendency to experience anger and related states such as frustration, and who did not see fulfilling moral obligations as important were more likely to prescribe psychotropic drugs. Also more likely to recommend psychotropic drugs, but for different reasons, were PS who were susceptible to stress but not shy or socially anxious, who showed friendliness but little interest in others, and who lacked distance in their decision-making.\nHealth promotion is not simply a matter of educating those young people who take psychotropic drugs - health professionals must also question the criteria that inform their decisions.

We used a simple, multiple bias adjustment method to estimate the causal effect of social anxiety disorder (SAD) on subsequent depression. A Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis was applied to data from the Early Developmental Stages of Psychiatry (EDSP) study, and bias due to confounding, sampling and measurement was modelled. With conventional logistic regression analysis, the risk for depression was elevated in the presence of SAD only in the older cohort (age 17-24 years at baseline assessment); odds ratio (OR) = 3.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64-5.70, adjusted for sex and age. The bias-adjusted estimate was 2.01 with interval limits of 0.61 and 9.71. Thus, given the data and the bias model used, there was considerably more uncertainty about the real effect, but the probability that SAD increases the risk for subsequent depression (OR > 1) was 88.6% anyway.

An impulse control disorder can be diagnosed if such actions occur frequently, even in low-stress situations. In psychiatry there are a number of syndromes that are associated with an impulse control disorder. Neurobiological findings point to a reduced turnover of serotonin in the brain of persons with an impulse control disorder and aggressive behaviour. However, a reduced turnover of serotonin is also found in persons who can consume immoderate amounts of alcohol but who experience no such unpleasant effects and thus have a high risk of becoming dependent. The serotonin turnover of an individual is controlled by environmental influences in interaction with genetic factors.

Although this impact has already been felt, its full breadth and depth can only be anticipated. Eventually, the most profound impact of Wayne Fenton's legacy will likely be the one Wayne most fervently desired: that people with psychiatric disorders receive better and more effective treatments for their illnesses. By virtue of the MATRICS initiative, this impact will begin in the context of treatments for the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, which is currently a critical unmet need. Within academic settings, this specific impact is already evident as a resurgence of interest in the neurobiology and pharmacology relevant to cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. As envisioned by Wayne Fenton, however, the impact of MATRICS and the other programs he initiated will be broader than \"only\" the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. His vision was to target a drug treatment to an individual symptom domain, individualizing treatment regimens for each patient, without requiring a drug to be effective in all domains. Thus, the particular target of opportunity that provided Wayne Fenton's focus in the initiation of the MATRICS program is already having an important impact, but in the longer term these efforts will no doubt lead to parallel developments and improvements in the treatment of other psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Clinical utility of autism spectrum disorder scoring algorithms for the child symptom inventory-4.", "Abstract": "Few studies examine the clinical utility of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) rating scales for screening referrals to child psychiatry clinics.

In addition, a cohort of twenty-six patients with clozapine-associated diabetes at the University of Rochester Medical Center Department of Psychiatry were examined for histories of DKA through review of medical records. Based on a total sample of 26 case reports including three unpublished cases at University of Rochester, associations between clinical and demographic variables and DKA were examined.\nAfrican American patients were significantly more likely than other patients to have DKA (p < 0.0001). Clozapine treatment duration was significantly shorter among patients with DKA than those without DKA (p < 0.0001), with 61.5% of patients developing DKA within three months of clozapine initiation. Also, presence of antidiabetic medications was negatively correlated with DKA (p < 0.0001). Trends were noted toward an association between low doses of clozapine (p < 0.0583) and toward a negative association between family history of diabetes (p < 0.0696).\nClozapine is associated with DKA that usually presents in patients who have not previously been diagnosed with diabetes. DKA typically occurs early in the course of treatment, when clozapine treatment duration is short and doses are low."}, {"Title": "Brief screening instruments for risky drinking in the outpatient psychiatry clinic.", "Abstract": "In this pilot study, we compared two brief screening instruments, the T-ACE (Tolerance, Annoyed, Cut down, Eye-opener) and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), with a clinician interview and structured clinical interview (SCID) to determine if they improved identification of risky drinking in a psychiatry clinic compared to clinician interviews. Sixteen of 50 subjects satisfied DSM-IV criteria for lifetime alcohol abuse or dependence on the SCID, and four, all T-ACE positive, were listed \"correctly\" in the chart as having an alcohol problem.

The sample consisted of 90 female patients (30 OCD; 30 AN; 30 BN), who had been consecutively referred to the Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital of Bellvitge, Barcelona. All subjects met DSM-IV criteria for those pathologies. The assessment consisted of the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI), Questionnaire of obsessive traits and personality by Vallejo, Eating Attitudes Test-40 (EAT-40), Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). ANCOVA tests (adjusted for age and body mass index) and multiple linear regression models based on obsessive-compulsiveness, obsessive personality traits and perfectionism, as independent variables, were applied to determine the best predictors of eating disorder severity. On ancova several significant differences were found between obsessive-compulsive and eating-disordered patients (MOCI, P < 0.001; EAT, P < 0.001; EDI, P < 0.001), whereas some obsessive personality traits were not eating disorder specific. A total of 16.7% OCD patients presented a comorbid eating disorder, whereas 3.3% eating disorders patients had an OCD diagnosis. In the eating disorder group, the presence of OC symptomatology was positively associated (r = 0.57, P < 0.001) with the severity of the eating disorder. The results were maintained after adjusting for comorbidity. Although some obsessive-compulsive and eating disorder patients share common traits (e.g. some personality traits especially between OCD and AN), both disorders seem to be clinically and psychopathologically different."}, {"Title": "Terrorism, trauma, and mass casualty triage: how might we solve the latest mind-body problem?", "Abstract": "The global war on terrorism has led to increased concern about the ability of the U.S. healthcare system to respond to casualties from a chemical, biological, or radiological agent attack. Relatively little attention, however, has focused on the potential, in the immediate aftermath of such an attack, for large numbers of casualties presenting to triage points with acute health anxiety and idiopathic physical symptoms. This sort of \"mass idiopathic illness\" is not a certain outcome of chemical, biological, or radiological attack. However, in the event that this phenomenon occurs, it could result in surges in demand for medical evaluations that may disrupt triage systems and endanger lives. Conversely, if continuous primary care is not available for such patients after initial triage, many may suffer with unrecognized physical and emotional injuries and illness. This report is the result of an expert planning initiative seeking to facilitate triage protocols that will address the possibility of mass idiopathic illness and bolster healthcare system surge capacity. The report reviews key triage assumptions and gaps in knowledge and offers a four-stage triage model for further discussion and research. Optimal triage approaches offer flexibility and should be based on empirical studies, critical incident modeling, lessons from simulation exercises, and case studies. In addition to staging, the proposed triage and longitudinal care model relies on early recognition of symptoms, development of a registry, and use of non-physician care management to facilitate later longitudinal followup and collaboration between primary care and psychiatry for the significant minority of patients who develop persistent idiopathic symptoms associated with reduced functional status."}, {"Title": "A quantitative association study between schizotypal traits and COMT, PRODH and BDNF genes in a healthy Chinese population.", "Abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), proline dehydrogenase (PRODH), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genes are possible susceptibility genes for schizophrenia. We hypothesized that these genes are also associated with schizotypal traits, which are heritable and related to schizophrenia. We genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) from the COMT, PRODH and BDNF genes, and performed a series of association analyses between alleles, genotypes or haplotypes, and quantitative schizotypal trait scores derived from the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ), in 465 Chinese healthy subjects. We found that 'years of education' was a major influence on seven out of nine schizotypal components, three schizotypal factors and the total SPQ scores. Molecular genetic analysis of COMT, PRODH and BDNF genes showed no significant effects of any variants on schizotypal components or factors of SPQ after correction for multiple testing, although there were weak association between COMT Val158Met (rs4680G/A) and the odd speech subscale (allele-wise, P=0.04; genotype-wise, P=0.049), between COMT Val158Met (rs4680G/A) and the suspiciousness subscale (genotype-wise, P=0.024), and between BDNF Val66Met and the Factor 2 interpersonal measure (genotype-wise, P=0.027) before correction. Furthermore, we found SNP Val158Met (rs4680) of the COMT gene significantly influenced the scores of some of schizotypal traits including total SPQ score, the disorganization factor and the constricted affect subscale in male subjects only. However, the effect was in the opposite direction of an earlier association with the SPQ reported by Avramopoulos et al.

Psychotherapy by medical practitioners is financially supported by universal health care funding with supplementation by patients and their private health insurance. Federally funded health benefits for up to 12 psychology consultations per year are provided on referral from GPs and psychiatrists, and initial takeup has been very strong. Mrs. A would be a typical patient for such a referral. However, she would not fulfill criteria for priority access from state-funded mental health services.

Models of mental healthcare have changed dramatically in the last few decades and academic centres are often conforming reluctantly to this change or even trying to withstand it rather than being proactive and leading the process. Furthermore, only a minority of big or well organised university psychiatric departments are currently able to compete successfully with other academic centres for the meagre funds available for research, and at the same time to respond effectively to the persistent demand to be as 'productive' as non-academic hospitals or mental health services in terms of numbers of patients seen and treated in ordinary clinical practice. In several European countries, psychiatry has become less attractive to medical students and junior doctors than it was in the past, and recruitment of smart young researchers in academic departments has become increasingly difficult. In addition, the current confusion about the identity of psychiatry is generating uncertainty and controversies about the content of psychiatric education and training, which in some countries is being regarded as obsolete. Finally, the need to interact with an increasingly broad range of counterparts - including other mental health professionals, administrators at a variety of levels, families and their organisations, magistrates and journalists - has caught some academics unprepared. These new challenges in clinical practice, teaching and research need to be approached in a thoughtful and comprehensive way. The role and aims of academic psychiatry need to be redefined so that it can resume the initiative and lead further developments in the field rather than being overwhelmed by them."}, {"Title": "Presidential address: Early parent-infant interaction and mental health.", "Abstract": "The importance and meaning of early mother-infant interaction and their possible connection with developmental psychopathology and child psychiatry practice are presented.

Twenty-four percent of patients with bipolar disorder were rapid cycling at the time of their visit; for 5 of these patients, rapid cycling was thought to be related to antidepressant use. Sixty-one percent of patients with bipolar disorder were taking an antidepressant; 69.5% were taking a mood stabilizer. Of these patients with bipolar disorder, 19% were evaluated as high suicidality risk, while 47% were considered moderate risk.

The primary objectives of the program, which still continues, are to improve students' comfort and skills in communicating with and assessing patients facing the end of life and to reflect on their experiences. Students interview a hospitalized patient, family, and caregivers; assess specified end-of-life domains and management plans; reflect on the experience; and then prepare a report for presentation at a case conference facilitated by dedicated multidisciplinary faculty. Many students interview patients while rotating on psychiatry consults, and the case conference occurs during the psychiatry clerkship.

An assessment of the personal impact of the exercise on the students who completed the program in 2005 and 2006 revealed six themes, including students' recognition of the complexity of patients' reactions to dying, students' appreciation of the value of the clinicians' presence, and students' personal reflections. This experience suggests that a hands-on end-of-life exercise is feasible and will be well received in the acute inpatient setting.

The identification of the underlying genetic variation will therefore transform parts of psychiatry toward a neuroscience-based discipline. With the sequence of the human genome now available, the majority of common variations identified, and new high-throughput technologies arriving in academic research laboratories, the identification of genes is expected to explain a large proportion of the risk of developing mental disorders. So far, a number of risk genes have been identified, but no major gene has emerged. The majority of these genes participate in the regulation of biogenic amines that play critical roles in affect modulation and reward systems. The identification of genetic variations associated with mental disorders should provide an approach to evaluate risk for mental disorders, adjust pharmacotherapy on the individual level, and even allow for preventive interactions. New targets for the development of treatment are anticipated to derive from results of genetic studies. In this review, we summarize the current state of psychiatric genetics, underscore current discussions, and predict where the field is expected to move in the near future."}, {"Title": "Assessment of spirituality and its relevance to addiction treatment.", "Abstract": "The prominence of Twelve-Step programs has led to increased attention on the putative role of spirituality in recovery from addictive disorders. We developed a 6-item Spirituality Self-Rating Scale designed to reflect a global measure of spiritual orientation to life, and we demonstrated here its internal consistency reliability in substance abusers on treatment and in nonsubstance abusers. This scale and the measures related to recovery from addiction and treatment response were applied in three diverse treatment settings: a general hospital inpatient psychiatry service, a residential therapeutic community, and methadone maintenance programs. Findings on these patient groups were compared to responses given by undergraduate college students, medical students, addiction faculty, and chaplaincy trainees. These suggest that, for certain patients, spiritual orientation is an important aspect of their recovery.

Besides clarification of the political background to the assassination, the question of the delinquent's criminal responsibility has been posed from the very beginning. For the first time Sefeloge's case is examined from a medicohistorical perspective. Due to the importance of the circumstances, a forensic scientist and three well-known psychiatrists made this forensic examination. These medical professionals seemed particularly competent because of their common experience with psychiatric patients. This unique case from nineteenth century Germany is exemplary in that the psychiatrist was generally accepted as an expert witness to evaluate crimes in the context of unclear mental conditions. From there the development of forensic psychiatry could proceed without hindrance."}, {"Title": "Highly palatable diet consumption increases protein oxidation in rat frontal cortex and anxiety-like behavior.", "Abstract": "Obesity is frequently associated with consumption of high amounts of sugar and/or fat. Studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of overweight and obesity associated or not with increase rates of psychiatry disorders, in particular mood and anxiety disorders. Recent works have demonstrated an association between specific genes involved in oxidative stress metabolism and anxiety-like behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a highly palatable diet enriched with sucrose in body fat mass composition, anxiety behavior and brain oxidative status. Twenty male Wistar rats received two different diets during four months: standard chow (SC) and highly palatable (HP). Metabolic parameters, behavioral tests and oxidative stress status were evaluated. Body fat mass, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were altered in the HP group (p<0.01). The same group spends less time in light compartment and had a lower risk assessment behavior (p<0.05) but no differences were observed in the open field test habituation (p>0.05). Protein degradation, DCF and TBARS levels were not different in the hippocampus between groups; however, there were higher levels of protein degration in frontal cortex of HP groups (p<0.05), although DCF and TBARS levels don't differ from the SC group (p>0.05).

Twenty age-, gender- and BMI-matched healthy subjects were investigated at the Neuroendocrine Unit, Belgrade University.\nOral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at baseline in all and then 13 patients were assigned to receive SGA (risperidone or clozapine) and OGTT was repeated after 1 and 3 months.\nAt baseline, patients with schizophrenia had higher peak glucose levels (p < 0.05), glucose area under the curve (AUC; p < 0.05), peak insulin levels (p < 0.05), insulin AUC values during OGTT (p < 0.01) and the calculated homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) value than control subjects (p < 0.05). Patients with schizophrenia showed higher morning cortisol (p < 0.05) levels than control subjects. After 1 and 3 months of SGA therapy patients with schizophrenia gained bodyweight by 3.5 and 8.6%, respectively. Leptin levels steadily increased while cortisol levels decreased in the first month and remained so. Serum glucose, insulin and ghrelin levels on SGA were similar as at baseline. Circulating ghrelin levels decreased after OGTT during SGA which is consistent with a role for ghrelin in the initiation of meals.\nTreatment with SGA was associated with continuous weight gain, with an early increase in serum leptin levels and decrease in cortisol levels. Elevated circulating leptin was ineffective in the control of fat deposition. Similar plasma ghrelin levels and similar decrease pattern of ghrelin after OGTT compared to healthy subjects signify intact meal-promoting effects of ghrelin during SGA therapy, which at the same time renders anorexigenic pathways ineffective. This may lead to weight gain and further studies with a ghrelin antagonist may provide support for this hypothesis."}, {"Title": "Depression and mortality in elders referred for geriatric psychiatry consultation.", "Abstract": "The association between depressive symptoms and mortality was assessed in a 7-year longitudinal follow-up of subjects referred for geropsychiatric consultation.\nThe medical records of 89 referrals were reviewed.

From the perspective of cross-cultural psychiatry, one of the most important cultural factors may be differences in the explanatory model of illness. This article examines the relationship of causal beliefs, perceived service accessibility and attitudes towards seeking mental health care.\nThe sample consisted of 1000 immigrant and refugee women from five ethnic minority communities in Toronto, including three Chinese Canadian communities (Hong Kong, mainland China and Taiwan), Korean Canadians and Vietnamese Canadians. Data were acquired by a self-administered structured questionnaire. Quantitative data were analysed using MANOVA, ANOVA and stepwise multiple regression.\nThe five ethnic minority groups of women differed in their explanatory models about mental illness and distress. In the full model where other variables were controlled for, the most significant factor predicting attitudes towards seeking professional help was perceived access for all groups except the Hong Kong Chinese. In the last group, those subscribing more to a Western stress model of illness had a more positive attitude towards seeking professional help, while those subscribing more to supernatural beliefs had a more negative attitude. Age and education were not significant predictors.\nPerceived access is one of the main factors that influence attitudes toward seeking professional help. Explanatory models may predict help-seeking behaviours if perceived access to such services is available."}, {"Title": "[Proteomics: biomarker research in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Over the last decade, genomics research in psychiatry and neuroscience has provided important insights into genes expressed under different physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Contrary to the great expectations regarding a clinical use of these datasets, genomics failed to improve markedly the diagnostic and therapeutic options in brain disorders. Due to alternative splicing and posttranslational modifications, one single gene determines a multitude of gene products. Therefore, in order to understand molecular processes in neuropsychiatric disorders, it is necessary to unravel signal transduction pathways and complex interaction networks on the level of proteins, not only DNA and mRNA. Proteomics utilises high-throughput mass spectrometric protein identification that can reveal protein expression levels, posttranslational modifications and protein-protein interactions. Proteomic tools have the power to identify quantitative and qualitative protein patterns in postmortem brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum, thus increasing the knowledge about etiology and pathomechanisms of brain diseases. Comparing protein profiles in healthy and disease states provides an opportunity to establish specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. In addition, proteomic studies of the effects of medication - in vitro and in vivo - might help to design specific pharmaceutical agents with fewer side effects. In this overview, we present the most widely used proteomic techniques and illustrate the potential and limitations of this field of research. Furthermore, we provide insight into the contributions of proteomics to the study of psychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, drug addiction, schizophrenia and depression."}, {"Title": "Terrorism, suicide bombing, fear and mental health.", "Abstract": "This paper is based on the Bruce Burns Memorial Trust Lecture, Terrorism and Mental Health, presented in October 2005, in Birmingham. In addition to written sources, it is informed by the author's experience and contact with military and police experts in this arena over 28 years as a member of the British Army. The diagnosis and treatment of post traumatic mental disorders are not addressed in this paper. The author explores the general phenomenon of terrorism, in an endeavour to inform understanding of terrorist acts. He stresses the need for contextualisation of acts of terror, their perpetrators, their effects on populations and individuals, and attention to the psychology of groups. The author aims to invite and inform further thought and debate on the subject by raising a wide range of issues which do not sit comfortably within a strict psychiatric, research-based paradigm. The author covers a brief history of terrorism; organisational requirements of terror groups and the process of recruiting personnel to them; the means, motives and opportunities terrorists exploit in their work; the need for communication with terror groups; sacrificial death; governmental responses to terrorist acts and fear and mental health. The author proposes that terrorist organisations perform some of the functions of a family; that acts of terror are 'propaganda by deed'; that terrorism, or more precisely the media's treatment of it, breeds 'formless fears' which may directly lead to the development of fear-based symptoms and illness within societies. He notes that terrorism is an enterprise from which many players ('experts', media, politicians, etc.) benefit; that terrorism has its shadow in counter-terrorism, which may range from benign to malignant and that psychiatry could, in this context, acknowledge its bias towards individual psychologies and rectify its lack of understanding of groups and the behaviours of individuals within them."}, {"Title": "Mass violence and mental health--a view from forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The objectives of this paper are to develop insights into the mind of the terrorist, to conduct a review of health impacts on the health of populations, especially from the point of view of mental health impacts caused by terrorist attacks and to discern the role to be played by forensic psychiatry in emergencies caused by terrorist actions.

The following specialties were represented: neurology, obstetrics, gynecology, psychiatry, otolaryngology, and colposcopy. Interviews were semistructured, using an interview guide, based on the following seven categories: (1) profile of the specialist, (2) description of outpatient clinic services, (3) professional satisfaction, (4) assessment of the municipal health services, (5) assessment of the Family Health Program (Programa Sa\u00fade da Fam\u00edlia), (6) description of the referral process, and (7) reply letter utilization.\nMost of the specialists understood the importance of the reply letter and that this form of communication with the generalist would ensure continuity of care, avoid duplication of efforts or disorganized patient management, and would provide the generalist with the professional support required. However, the study found that most of the specialists do not routinely use the reply letter. In general, the specialists have their own criteria to reply or not to a referral, for example, whether the generalist \"deserved\" a reply, whether the patient will remain under their care, or whether the patient has a significant pathology.

Patients were treated with either escitalopram 10-20 mg/day (fixed at 10 mg/day for the first 4 weeks) or duloxetine 60 mg/day. The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline at week 8 in MADRS total score using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach. Efficacy, safety and tolerability measures were prospectively defined in the statistical analysis plan prior to study initiation unless otherwise specifically noted as conducted post hoc.\nA significantly greater proportion of escitalopram-treated patients completed the 8-week study compared with duloxetine-treated patients (87% vs 69%, respectively; p < 0.01). Mean baseline MADRS total scores were 31.0 for the escitalopram group and 31.6 for the duloxetine group. At week 8, escitalopram treatment resulted in significantly greater improvement compared with duloxetine on the prospectively defined primary efficacy endpoint of mean change from baseline in MADRS total score using the LOCF approach (least-squares mean difference [LSMD] -2.42; 95% CI -4.73, -0.11; p < 0.05). There was no difference between treatment groups in the observed cases (OC) analysis (LSMD -0.32; 95% CI -2.71, 2.07; p = 0.79). Significantly fewer escitalopram-treated patients discontinued because of adverse events compared with duloxetine (2% vs 13%, respectively; p < 0.01).\nThese findings suggest that escitalopram is better tolerated and at least as effective as the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder."}, {"Title": "Restraint and the question of validity.", "Abstract": "Restraint as an intervention in the management of acute mental distress has a long history that predates the existence of psychiatry. However, it remains a source of controversy with an ongoing debate as to its role. This article critically explores what to date has seemingly been only implicit in the debate surrounding the role of restraint: how should the concept of validity be interpreted when applied to restraint as an intervention? The practice of restraint in mental health is critically examined using two post-positivist constructions of validity, the pragmatic and the psychopolitical, by means of a critical examination of the literature. The current literature provides only weak support for the pragmatic validity of restraint as an intervention and no support to date for its psychopolitical validity. Judgements regarding the validity of any intervention that is coercive must include reference to the psychopolitical dimensions of both practice and policy."}, {"Title": "An observational study of medication administration errors in old-age psychiatric inpatients.", "Abstract": "Relatively little is known about medication administration errors in mental health settings.\nTo investigate the frequency and nature of medication administration errors in old-age psychiatry.

Most errors were of doubtful or minor severity. The pharmacist intervened on four occasions to prevent an error causing patient harm. The commonest errors observed were unauthorized tablet crushing or capsule opening (111/369, 30.1%), omission without a valid reason (100/369, 27.1%) and failure to record administration (87/369, 23.6%). Among the nurses observed, the error rate varied widely from no errors to one error in every two doses administered. Of the seven nurses who completed the post-observation questionnaire, all said they would be willing to be observed again.\nMedication administration errors are common and mostly minor.

Ovid Medline, Pubmed and the Cochrane Library were searched for pharmacological and clinical evidence of herbal medicines with psychotropic activity. A forward search of later citations was also conducted. Whilst substantial high-quality evidence exists for the use of kava and St John's wort in the treatment of anxiety and depression respectively, currently there is insufficient robust clinical evidence for the use of many other herbal medicines in psychiatric disorders. Phytotherapies which potentially have significant use in psychiatry, and urgently require more research are Rhodiola rosea (roseroot) and Crocus sativus (saffron) for depression; Passiflora incarnata (passionflower), Scutellaria lateriflora (scullcap) and Zizyphus jujuba (sour date) for anxiety disorders; and Piper methysticum (kava) for phobic, panic and obsessive-compulsive disorders. While depression and anxiety are commonly researched, the efficacy of herbal medicines in other mental disorders requires attention. The review addresses current issues in herbal psychotherapy: herbal safety, future areas of application, the relationship of herbal medicine with pharmaceuticals and the potential prescriptive integration of phytomedicines with synthetic psychotropic medicines.

(1992). Unfamiliar face recognition in relatively able autistic children. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 33, 843-859.], and it has been suggested that this impairment occurs because these individuals do not spontaneously attend to the eyes [e.g., Pelphrey, K.

Participants discriminated small spatial displacements of the eyes and the mouth. If the mouth region were attended to preferentially by individuals with ASD, we would expect ASD observers to be better at detecting subtle changes in mouth than eye displacements, relative to controls. Further, following Barton [Barton, J. J. S., Keenan, J. P., & Bass, T. (2001). Discrimination of spatial relations and features in faces: Effects of inversion and viewing duration.

We found that individuals with ASD performed significantly differently than controls for the eye, but not the mouth, trials. However, we found no difference in inversion effects between the two groups of observers. Furthermore, we found evidence of distinct subclasses of individuals with ASD: those who performed normally, and those who were impaired. These results suggests that typical individuals are better able to make use of information in the eyes than some individuals with ASD, but that there is no clear autism \"advantage\" in the use of information in the mouth region."}, {"Title": "Obesity and metabolic syndrome in a psychiatric rehabilitation service.", "Abstract": "People with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders suffer from increased rates of obesity and metabolic syndrome.

While there has been a coordinated community campaign to reduce tobacco smoking within the general population, mental health facilities have been reluctant to adopt such regulatory controls, and rarely target smoking prevention or treatment. This paper summarizes and discusses evidence relating to the clinical impact of tobacco smoking within inpatient psychiatric settings. A selective review of psychiatric and psychological research on smoking within inpatient settings was conducted, with a particular focus on the influence of smoking on the physical and mental health, pharmacotherapy, and social interactions of patients during their inpatient stay. Patients frequently alter their smoking habits during inpatient treatment, which can affect both their presentation and pharmacotherapeutic management. Smoking also appears to play a central role in social interactions on the ward, with staff frequently using cigarettes to reinforce certain behaviours. Despite current guidelines, mental health professionals rarely address nicotine use among their patients. Nevertheless, programmes that assist patients to quit during an inpatient stay have been shown to be both efficacious and cost-effective. Strategies that address staff concerns and assist in the implementation of effective smoking bans on psychiatric units are also available. Cessation should be a key component of inpatient treatment planning because this setting provides a safe and timely opportunity to help patients quit. A flowchart of interventions that could be incorporated within standard inpatient settings is proposed."}, {"Title": "Violent and nonviolent methods of suicide: different patterns may be found in men and women with severe depression.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate violent and nonviolent suicidal acts in men and women with severe depression. The records of 98 suicide victims, who had been admitted to the Department of Psychiatry, Lund University Hospital, Sweden between 1956 and 1969, were evaluated and the subjects were monitored up to 1998. The female group displayed a significant linear trend for nonviolent completed suicide after one suicide attempt, and even more significantly, after repeated attempts. A switch from only nonviolent suicide attempts to completed violent suicide was significantly more common in men than in women. These different progressions may contribute to the expected finding that men used violent methods for completed suicide more often than women."}, {"Title": "An investigation of long-term effects of group music therapy on agitation levels of people with Alzheimer's Disease.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the long-term effects of group music therapy on agitation manifested by nursing home residents with Alzheimer's disease.

In many chronic illnesses, a linear relationship cannot be found between the alleviation of symptoms and long-term functioning. Therefore, the efficacy of therapy cannot be estimated only by symptom scales. In addition, monitoring of the Quality of Life can be used to assess subjective satisfaction with therapy and to estimate its cost-effectiveness. Quality of Life scales have two basic subtypes: general and illness-specific questionnaires, which have been produced in huge numbers. In view of the fact that quality of life depends on culture, validated versions of these questionnaires have made in many countries. The topic has a fairly broad scope; therefore, in the present review, we offer a brief survey of the QOL-literature published during the last six years on the basis of four important journals which have a high impact factor and deal with general topics (American Journal of Psychiatry, Archives of General Psychiatry, Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, and British Journal of Psychiatry). In the first part we introduce the scales that are used most often, while in the second part we present the results of the illness-specific research studies. We hope that our review will be a good map to the labyrinth of this topic and will provide help for selecting the most suitable scale for everyone."}, {"Title": "Psychosocial and pharmacological interventions for depressed adults in primary care: a critical review.", "Abstract": "Primary care settings are the principal context for treating clinical depression, with researchers beginning to explore the efficacy of psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for depression within this infrastructure. Feasibility and process variables also are being assessed, including issues of cost-effectiveness, viability of collaborative care models, predictors of treatment outcome, and effectiveness of treatment providers without specialized mental health training. The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and American Psychiatric Association initially released guidelines for the treatment of depression in primary care [American Psychiatric Association, 1993.

The present study provides a contemporary review of outcome data for psychosocial and pharmacological interventions in primary care and extends beyond AHCPR guidelines insofar as focusing on feasibility and process variables, including the training and proficiency of primary care treatment providers, cost-effectiveness of primary care interventions, and predictors of treatment response and relapse. Based on current guidelines, problem-solving therapy (PST-PC), interpersonal psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy would be considered efficacious interventions for major depression, with cognitive-behavioral and cognitive therapy considered possibly efficacious.

Psychotic symptoms have been described in connection with the use of topiramate in individual cases, however. It is not known which concomitant circumstances favour the appearance of this side-effect, though. This is a report about a psychotic attack that happened for the first time and lasted for one night in a borderline patient who was treated with topiramate 250 mg/day shortly after the start of a febrile infection. After the infection had gone, topiramate was given again and titrated to 300 mg/day.

The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in costs per discharged patient and bed-day before and after the intervention. To illustrate quality improvements beyond the purpose of the national project the consumption of antipsychotics was included in the evaluation.\nSpecification of working hours per discharged patient and bed-day and an average hourly rate for a nurse provide the basis for the valuation. The cost of antipsychotics is based on an average daily use per discharged patient and bed-day. The monetary unit is Danish Kroner.\nThe wage costs per discharged patient were 18,487 before and 19,010 after the intervention. Per bed-day the costs were 2,642 and 2,679, respectively. Medicine costs per discharged patient were 198 before and 148 after the intervention while the costs per bed-day were 28 and 21, respectively.\nThis evaluation of costs shows that it is possible to develop and implement quality improvements without increasing costs.

Participants completed a short questionnaire pretraining and posttraining program. Attitudes toward ECT did not substantially differ between the 2 groups. For the entire sample, only 8.5% reported that they were well informed about ECT before the training session. More favorable attitudes were reported upon completion of the ECT education program compared with attitudes reported before training.

In Canada and the United States, there is a dearth of research on these issues: the study of social causes of psychosis has been replaced by a focus on the clinical encounter, in which clinician bias is presumed to be responsible for widespread misdiagnosis of psychosis in minority (mainly African-American) populations. The reasons for neglecting social causes of psychosis in the North American psychiatric literature are obscure but may have to do with the rise of genetic-biological paradigms in recent decades.\nThe neglect of social causes of psychosis in the North American psychiatric literature has been coincident with an increase in scholarly concern among European clinicians and researchers.

The prescription information (summary of product characteristics, SPC) is provided by pharmaceutical companies according to the requirements of regulatory authorities. The present study investigated the degree of agreement of German SPCs for 48 psychopharmaceuticals with the existing medico-scientific evidence in the area of TDM. For this aim, an empirical summary score of SPC content related to TDM (SPCC (TDM)) was calculated and compared with the level of recommendation of TDM (LOR) of the AGNP-TDM expert group consensus guidelines. Considerable disagreement was found between the information on TDM in SPCs and existing medico-scientific evidence, e.g., in the case of antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs. Even for well studied compounds, such as amitriptyline and clozapine, insufficient information on TDM is included in German SPCs. Small differences existed in the TDM-related information in SPCs of generic drugs with, however, much variance between Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Generally, it must be concluded that deficits exist in the preparation of German SPCs for psychopharmaceutical drugs with respect to empirical pharmacokinetic data, i.e., TDM-relevant information. It is recommended that SPCs of psychopharmaceuticals should be improved in terms of TDM-related information and that target plasma concentrations be adjusted according to the guidelines of the AGNP-TDM expert group.

Several of these drivers for change may appear at face value to be in conflict and a complex balance will be required if these changes are to be blended to ultimately improve the care provided to clients of our services."}, {"Title": "Blood Brain Barrier: The Role of GAD Antibodies in Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Goal of our case control study was to establish the presence of antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in patients with chronic psychotic disorders.\nSerum levels of GAD antibodies in 12 patients with chronic psychotic disorders (schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders) and 10 age-matched healthy control subjects were evaluated utilizing enzyme linked immunosorbitent assay (ELISA).\nAntibodies to GAD in patients with chronic psychotic disorders have a higher mean than nonpatient control individuals.\nOur findings provide the first in-vivo evidence of positive GAD antibodies in chronic psychotic disorders and potentially may be used as a screening for these disorders."}, {"Title": "Catatonia and consultation-liaison psychiatry study of 12 cases.", "Abstract": "Nowadays, catatonia is no more considered as a subtype of schizophrenia. Catatonia seems more frequently associated to mood disorders as well as general medical conditions. It is sometimes difficult to associate formally a medical etiology to this syndrome. But we found, in the literature, three groups of associated general medical conditions: neurological disorders, drug induced and toxic induced conditions, metabolic conditions. We present a prospective study of 12 clinical cases of catatonia due to general medical conditions we realized in the Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Department of the University Hospital of LILLE (France) during a period of 5 months. We find coherent data with the literature. However, our results suggest that if medical conditions precipitate the catatonia syndrome, they are rarely its only etiology. We think that if somatic factors are co-morbid with psychiatric conditions they do not necessarily predominate as the target of treatment. The treatment of the catatonia must be a priority and remain symptomatic, to allow in parallel the specific treatment for the somatic disorder or the psychiatric disorder."}, {"Title": "Sequential treatment of depression in primary care.", "Abstract": "In the past decade, in clinical psychiatry several investigations suggested the usefulness of a sequential way of integrating pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in mood disorders. The aim of this paper was to illustrate the practical implications of sequential treatment strategy for depression in primary care, with particular reference to the increasingly common problem of recurrent depression.\nThe Authors tried to integrate the evidence which derives from meta-analyses and comprehensive general reviews with the insights which derive from controlled studies concerned with specific populations.\nThe sequential treatment of mood disorders is an intensive, two-stage approach, which derives from the awareness that one course of treatment with a specific tool (whether pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy) is unlikely to entail solution to the affective disturbances of patients, both in research and in clinical practice settings. The aim of the sequential approach is to add therapeutic ingredients as long as they are needed. In this sense, it introduces a conceptual shift in clinical practice."}, {"Title": "The story of an ambivalent relationship: Sigmund Freud and Eugen Bleuler.", "Abstract": "This paper examines the short-lived flirtation between psychoanalysis and academia and psychiatry in Europe and the reasons for, and consequences of, the fact that their paths diverged. It is argued that Bleuler's break with the psychoanalytic movement is a crucial and, until now, largely underestimated turning point. Bleuler's separation from the psychoanalytic movement was probably more important for the course it has since taken than those of Adler, Stekel, or even Jung. Bleuler's analysis by correspondence by Freud, and its failure, was of paramount importance for the future relationship between Freud and Bleuler, and for Bleuler's assessment of psychoanalysis."}, {"Title": "Depression, self-care, and medication adherence in type 2 diabetes: relationships across the full range of symptom severity.", "Abstract": "We examined the association between depression, measured as either a continuous symptom severity score or a clinical disorder variable, with self-care behaviors in type 2 diabetes.\nWe surveyed 879 type 2 diabetic patients from two primary care clinics using the Harvard Department of Psychiatry/National Depression Screening Day Scale (HANDS), the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities, and self-reported medication adherence.\nOf the patients, 19% met the criteria for probable major depression (HANDS score >or=9), and an additional 66.5% reported at least some depressive symptoms. After controlling for covariates, patients with probable major depression reported significantly fewer days' adherent to diet, exercise, and glucose self-monitoring regimens (P < 0.01) and 2.3-fold increased odds of missing medication doses in the previous week (95% CI 1.5-3.6, P < 0.001) compared with all other respondents. Continuous depressive symptom severity scores were better predictors of nonadherence to diet, exercise, and medications than categorically defined probable major depression. Major depression was a better predictor of glucose monitoring. Among the two-thirds of patients not meeting the criteria for major depression (HANDS score <9, n = 709), increasing HANDS scores were incrementally associated with poorer self-care behaviors (P < 0.01).\nThese findings challenge the conceptualization of depression as a categorical risk factor for nonadherence and suggest that even low levels of depressive symptomatology are associated with nonadherence to important aspects of diabetes self-care. Interventions aimed at alleviating depressive symptoms, which are quite common, could result in significant improvements in diabetes self-care."}, {"Title": "A comparative survey of missed initial and follow-up appointments to psychiatric specialties in the United kingdom.", "Abstract": "Missed appointments are common in psychiatry.

This study examined the frequency of missed appointments among 9,511 initial outpatient appointments and 7,700 follow-up appointments across ten psychiatric subspecialties in a publicly funded mental health service in the United Kingdom.\nThe pooled missed appointment rate was 15.9%, higher than in previous studies on primary and secondary care attendance in the United Kingdom. Nonattendance was lowest on Fridays, in winter months, and in geriatric psychiatry and highest for substance abuse services and in community psychiatry. In most services, attendance improved after the initial appointment, but in psychosomatic medicine and geriatric psychiatry this pattern was reversed.\nThere was a low rate of missed appointments in geriatric psychiatry, rehabilitation psychiatry, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and psychosocial medicine.

Results from a randomized controlled equivalence trial.", "Abstract": "The use of interactive videoconferencing to provide psychiatric services to geographically remote regions, often referred to as telepsychiatry, has gained wide acceptance. However, it is not known whether clinical outcomes of telepsychiatry are as good as those achieved through face-to-face contact. This study compared a variety of clinical outcomes after psychiatric consultation and, where needed, brief follow-up for outpatients referred to a psychiatric clinic in Canada who were randomly assigned to be examined face to face or by telepsychiatry.\nA total of 495 patients in Ontario, Canada, referred by their family physician for psychiatric consultation were randomly assigned to be examined face to face (N=254) or by telepsychiatry (N=241). The treating psychiatrists had the option of providing monthly follow-up appointments for up to four months. The study tested the equivalence of the two forms of service delivery on a variety of outcome measures.\nPsychiatric consultation and follow-up delivered by telepsychiatry produced clinical outcomes that were equivalent to those achieved when the service was provided face to face. Patients in the two groups expressed similar levels of satisfaction with service. An analysis limited to the cost of providing the clinical service indicated that telepsychiatry was at least 10% less expensive per patient than service provided face to face.\nPsychiatric consultation and short-term follow-up can be as effective when delivered by telepsychiatry as when provided face to face. These findings do not necessarily mean that other types of mental health services, for example, various types of psychotherapy, are as effective when provided by telepsychiatry."}, {"Title": "Mental illness and Egyptian families.", "Abstract": "People from Egypt have cultural belief systems about mental illness and its causes that are at variance from Anglo-Saxon-derived understandings that predominate in Australian psychiatry. These differences in understanding can affect how mental health services are experienced and accepted by this cultural group. This paper is a review of the literature on Egyptians' beliefs about mental illness and how families in Egypt cope with a relative with mental illness. Because of limited literature on Egyptians' experience with mental illness in Australia, this paper will be used to shed some light on the way in which people experience mental illness and communicate this suffering in the Australian context, based on what has been known to occur in Egypt. The Zar cult and related practices focusing on belief in the evil eye, magic, and evil possession will be explored. Historical and contemporary mental health care systems in Egypt, and the influence of education and religion are discussed. In order to provide culturally sensitive care, nurses need to be aware of possible influences on belief systems about mental illness. This paper has the potential of helping nurses to gain a deeper understanding of cultures that differ from theirs and to provide care to clients and their families based on respect for the others' beliefs, values, and practices."}, {"Title": "Analysis of positive Edinburgh depression scale referrals to a consultation liaison psychiatry service in a two-year period.", "Abstract": "Antenatal depression is a depressive episode that begins in pregnancy and is often a predictor of postnatal depression.

The other aim was to review known risk factors in the women and note any significant findings. An audit of all women referred to the psychiatry team because of positive Edinburgh scores during a 2-year period was completed. Information about Edinburgh scores, clinical diagnoses at the time of the psychiatric appointment, and factors such as relationship status, domestic violence, ethnicity, and substance use was noted. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Fourth Edition criteria: 36.5% of the women had an adjustment disorder, 13% had a major depression, 10% had dysthymia, 8% had a recurrent depressive disorder, 2% had post-traumatic stress disorder, and 2% had a borderline personality disorder. The findings demonstrated the usefulness of using a screening tool such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale in detecting women requiring psychiatric intervention and highlighted the importance of a psychiatric interview assessment to interpret the scores of screened patients in terms of clinically relevant syndromes."}, {"Title": "Social defeat and the culture of chronicity: or, why schizophrenia does so well over there and so badly here.", "Abstract": "The history of the way schizophrenia has been conceptualized in American psychiatry has led us to be hesitant to explore the role of social causation in schizophrenia.

These principles are: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice, along with concern for their scope of application. However, conflicts between the different principles are commonplace in psychiatric practice, especially in forensic psychiatry, where duties to patients often conflict with duties to third parties such as the public. This article seeks to highlight some of the specific ethical dilemmas encountered in forensic psychiatry: the excessive use of segregation for the protection of others, the ethics of using mechanical restraint when clinically beneficial and the use of physical treatment without consent. We argue that justice, as a principle, should be paramount in forensic psychiatry, and that there is a need for a more specific code of ethics to cover specialised areas of medicine like forensic psychiatry. This code should specify that in cases of conflict between different principles, justice should gain precedence over the other principles."}, {"Title": "[In favour of a \"new social psychiatry\".

Operational diagnostic systems like ICD-10 and DSM-IV aimed at a standardisation of psychiatric language which can be accepted by different schools in psychiatry. However, ICD-10 and DSM-IV should not be misinterpreted as \"nosology\" because they do not reflect a specific model of psychiatric diseases. The advantages of operational diagnostic systems as instruments for communication in a clinical and scientific context are limited by the fact that they disregard the subjective psychopathology. This dimension, however, deserves attention in clinic and research."}, {"Title": "Implicit learning, executive function and hedonic activity in chronic polydrug abusers, currently abstinent polydrug abusers and controls.", "Abstract": "The study seeks to evaluate impairments of implicit learning and executive function in chronic polydrug abusers.

Hedonic thoughts and activities as well as depressive symptoms were assessed through questionnaires.\nIn chronic polydrug abusers, there were moderate impairments of implicit learning, of acquisition, reversal and extinction of conditioned responses, of latent inhibition as well as anhedonia, while working memory was spared. In the abstinent group, cognitive performance was normal except for latent inhibition and more anhedonia and depression than in controls.\nThe findings suggest that current polydrug abusers suffer from impairment of many cognitive functions and from anhedonia. During abstinence, there is near normal cognitive function but still anhedonia.

The present study evaluated the relation of self-reported depression and anxiety to several common measures of executive functioning: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, the Trail Making Test, the Controlled Oral Word Association, and the Letter-Number Sequencing subtest of the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale-III. Records from 86 adult patients evaluated in an outpatient psychiatry unit were examined. Correlations between self-reported depression or anxiety and most measures of executive functioning were small and non-significant. The variance predicted by depression or anxiety after controlling for age, gender, and IQ was minimal (typically < or =3.0%), even after conducting diagnostic subgroup analyses. These results suggest that impaired performance on measures of executive functioning is minimally related to self-reported depression and anxiety within mixed psychiatric settings."}, {"Title": "Folie \u00e0 deux and shared psychotic disorder.", "Abstract": "Folie \u00e0 deux (FAD) was first described in 19th century France. Since then, the concept has been elaborated, and several subtypes of FAD have been successively reported in France. In contrast, studies in German-speaking psychiatry mainly focused on the conceptual boundary between reactive/endogenous psychosis and etiological hypothesis (ie, psychogenesis vs genetic predisposition). In North America, Gralnick wrote a seminal review and redefined four subtypes of FAD by adopting the European classical concepts. More recently, \"shared psychotic disorder\" in DSM or \"induced delusional disorder\" in ICD-10 was branched off from FAD. However, several classical subcategories of FAD were not included in these recent definitions, the nosological significance of which should not be underestimated. We examined demographic data of FAD case reports published from the 19th to the 21st century and found that some of the earlier hypotheses, such as females being more susceptible, older and more intelligent individuals being more likely to be inducers, and sister-sister pairs being the most common relationship, were not supported. The controversial issue of the etiology of FAD-association of subjects or genetically driven psychosis-was re-examined in light of recent studies."}, {"Title": "Cycloid psychosis: an examination of the validity of the concept.", "Abstract": "The diagnosis of cycloid psychosis has a long tradition in European psychiatry. However, it has been poorly assimilated within the DSM IV and ICD-10 diagnostic systems. Leonhard set the basis for the current conceptualization of the disorder, and Perris and Brockington developed the first operational diagnostic criteria. However, the two conceptualizations of the disorder are not the same and differ across a number of meaningful variables. Cycloid psychosis is a useful concept in that it possesses both clinical and predictive validity. Despite the high prevalence of mood symptoms and syndromes, cycloid psychosis does not equal schizoaffective disorder. Although a substantial body of evidence suggests that cycloid psychosis differs meaningfully from typical schizophrenia, it is less clear whether it differs from major mood disorders or represents an independent nosological entity. The existence of putative subtypes is also likely, and the differentiation between affective and nonaffective subtypes has received some support."}, {"Title": "Association between 5-HT2A, TPH1 and GNB3 genotypes and response to typical neuroleptics: a serotonergic approach.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a common psychiatric disease affecting about 1% of population.

The introduction of a long-acting injectable atypical antipsychotic, long-acting risperidone, may be of benefit in these special groups. To determine the effectiveness of long-acting risperidone, the literature was reviewed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-acting risperidone in these populations. The impact of race was also considered.\nStudies published between January 2002 and November 2005 were reviewed as identified from literature searches using MEDLINE and Embase. The primary research parameter was \"longacting risperidone\" and literature pertaining to these particular patient groups selected. Abstracts and posters on long-acting risperidone presented at key psychiatry congresses were also reviewed during this time period. PRINCIPLE OBSERVATIONS: Results demonstrated that long-acting risperidone is effective and well tolerated in elderly patients, young patients or those with a first episode of schizophrenia, patients with schizoaffective disorder, and patients of different ethnicity. All patient groups demonstrated improvements in mean total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores and Clinical Global Impressions of Severity Scale scores. Long-acting risperidone also reduced relapse rates and had a favourable tolerability profile.

Analyses were performed to determine predictors of later criminal behavior, and the psychopathological syndrome scales in the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry (AMDP) system were used to establish possible psychopathological characteristics for such behavior.\nOne hundred and sixty nine (10.2%) of the 1662 patients had been convicted in the 7-12 years after discharge, whereby male patients (117 of 685, 17.1%) outnumbered female patients ( 52 of 977, 5.3%) by more than 3 to 1. The rate of violent crimes was especially high: 62 (3.7%) patients were convicted for physical injury offences. Five cases of manslaughter or murder were recorded. AMDP syndrome scales were found to be predictive for later criminal offences. Significantly higher rates of criminal conviction and recidivism were found for patients with lack of insight at discharge. Analyses also showed a significantly higher risk of non-violent and violent crimes in patients with a hostility syndrome at admission and discharge.

An interrelation exists among populations exposed to OPs, acute OP toxicity, neurobehavioral effects, depression, suicide, and fatality. Acute OP toxicity is characterized by the cholinergic syndrome with systemic and central nervous system effects. Organophosphate-induced neurobehavioral effects result in depression. A potential risk of depression and suicide exists in farm workers exposed to OPs. The sociodemographics of depression include age, gender, race, geographic region, social factors, economics, psychiatric disorders, medical conditions, and hereditary factors. Suicide is a major consequence of depression, with multiple sociodemographic risk factors. Developing countries have a higher incidence of OP toxicity, with limited information on the prevalence of depression. In these countries, the incidence of suicide is high, affecting more females. Suicide is more prevalent in rural areas, and in farming communities, commonly with ingestion of OPs. In industrialized countries, the incidence of OP toxicity is lower, but the prevalence of depression is higher. Suicide rates are lower in industrialized countries, affecting more males, the urban population, and farming communities. Other lethal methods of suicide, such as hanging, firearms, electrocution, and drug overdose are more common in industrialized countries. A potential risk of depression or suicide certainly exists from OP toxicity, largely depending on the epidemiology or sociodemographics of these disorders.

A telephone follow-up approximately 12 months later augmented the survival data.\nOf residents whose outcomes were known, 73% survived throughout the nine-month study period. Residents who died before the five-month follow-up had higher scores on the depression measure than those surviving longer. Reduced survival was predicted by greater dependency at baseline. Of 188 surviving residents, 63 (38%) were classified as depressed at baseline. Twenty-seven (43%) of the latter were still classed as depressed at five and nine months. Just 19% of residents rated as depressed at baseline were prescribed antidepressant medication, increasing to 26% at each follow-up. There was significant coexistence of cognitive impairment and depressive symptomatology.\nHigh levels of mortality, psychiatric morbidity, and chronicity of depressed mood among residents requires care homes to improve access to specialist resources such as geriatric consultation, old-age psychiatry, occupational therapy, and physiotherapy. Findings suggest that future care standards should include external factors, such as the extent of access to relevant specialist services for vulnerable older people."}, {"Title": "A randomised controlled trial to test the feasibility of a collaborative care model for the management of depression in older people.", "Abstract": "Depression is the most common mental health disorder in people aged over 65 years.

The intervention group received care managed by a community psychiatric nurse who delivered an intervention comprising a facilitated self-help programme with close liaison with primary care professionals and old-age psychiatry according to a defined protocol. The usual care group received usual GP care. A nested qualitative study explored the views of the health professionals and patients regarding the acceptability and effectiveness of the intervention.\nThe main outcome measure was recovery from depression. Patients in the intervention group were less likely to suffer from major depressive disorder at follow up compared with usual care (0.32, 95% confidence = interval = 0.11 to 0.93, P = 0.036). The qualitative component of the study demonstrated the acceptability of the intervention to patients.\nA model of collaborative care for older people with depression, used in a primary care setting with a facilitated self-help intervention is more effective than usual GP care.

A sample of 131 remitted first-episode patients, aged 18 to 45 years, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder was included (i.e., all patients with a first psychotic episode from October 2001 through December 2002 who were willing to participate). After 6 months of positive symptom remission, they were randomly and openly assigned to the discontinuation strategy or maintenance treatment. Maintenance treatment was carried out according to American Psychiatric Association guidelines, preferably using low-dose atypical antipsychotics. The discontinuation strategy was carried out by gradual symptom-guided tapering of dosage and discontinuation if feasible. Follow-up was 18 months. Main outcome measures were relapse rates and social and vocational functioning.\nTwice as many relapses occurred with the discontinuation strategy (43% vs. 21%, p = .011). Of patients who received the strategy, approximately 20% were successfully discontinued. Recurrent symptoms caused another approximately 30% to restart antipsychotic treatment, while in the remaining patients discontinuation was not feasible at all. There were no advantages of the discontinuation strategy regarding functional outcome.\nOnly a limited number of patients can be successfully discontinued. High relapse rates do not allow a discontinuation strategy to be universal practice. However, if relapse risk can be carefully managed by close monitoring, in some remitted first-episode patients a guided discontinuation strategy may offer a feasible alternative to maintenance treatment. Further research is needed to find predictors of successful discontinuation."}, {"Title": "Does evidence-based medicine apply to psychiatry?", "Abstract": "Evidence-based psychiatry (EBP) has arisen through the application of evidence-based medicine (EBM) to psychiatry. However, there may be aspects of psychiatric disorders and treatments that do not conform well to the assumptions of EBM. This paper reviews the ongoing debate about evidence-based psychiatry and investigates the applicability, to psychiatry, of two basic methodological features of EBM: prognostic homogeneity of clinical trial groups and quantification of trial outcomes. This paper argues that EBM may not be the best way to pursue psychiatric knowledge given the particular features of psychiatric disorders and their treatments. As a result, psychiatry may have to develop its own standards for rigour and validity. This paper concludes that EBM has had a powerful influence on how psychiatry investigates and understands mental disorders. Psychiatry could influence EBM in return, reshaping it in ways that are more clinically useful and congruent with patients' needs."}, {"Title": "Relevance of exclusion criteria in antidepressant clinical trials: a replication study.", "Abstract": "Patients in clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressants are different from those typically treated in clinical practice, which may affect the generalizability of data from RCTs.

Am J Psychiatry. 2002;159:469-473), demonstrating that most patients seeking clinical treatment of depression would not qualify for an RCT based on common exclusion criteria.\nEight hundred seventeen patients presenting to an outpatient private practice were evaluated by retrospective chart review. The 11 exclusion criteria outlined in the previous study were applied to a sample of 348 depressed adults to determine the percentage that would have qualified for an RCT.\nWe have closely replicated the study of Zimmerman et al, finding that 91% of our sample would not qualify for an RCT based on presence of any of the 11 exclusion criteria. Prevalence of 7 criteria applied were found significantly different in our population when compared with the study of Zimmerman et al, yet exclusion rates came within 0.2%. When only the 5 most common criteria were applied, exclusion rates remained high.\nSome exclusion criteria are essential for ethical or diagnostic purposes or to reduce heterogeneity; others are somewhat arbitrary, widening the gap between research and clinical practice. Ninety-one percent of patients presenting for treatment of depression would not qualify for RCTs if the 11 exclusion criteria identified were applied; if a standard severity cutoff score and 4 criteria considered relevant to safety or diagnostic validity were used, nearly 75% would not qualify.

The perfect tocolytic that is uniformly effective with complete fetomaternal safety does not exist. Tocolytic agents differ in cost, utero-specificity, safety, efficacy and whether they are licensed for use. The main three agents that are used worldwide are beta-agonists, Ca(2+) channel blockers and vasopressin/oxytocin receptor antagonists. beta-Agonists are gradually being phased out of use and are being replaced by either nifedipine or atosiban. The evidence base for atosiban is strong but the evidence is of poor quality for nifedipine. The balance of evidence indicates that atosiban is as effective as nifedipine and more effective than beta-agonists and is significantly safer than both. Atosiban was developed specifically to treat preterm labor, so the cost is higher than nifedipine or ritodrine. However, the cost of a course of atosiban (approximately 200 pounds) should not only be considered in comparison with other tocolytic agents but to other medical budgets (e.g., oncology, fertility, cardiology and psychiatry) and to the huge healthcare costs associated with the morbidity and mortality caused by preterm birth.

Our review discusses the neuropsychiatric approach to the evaluation of state hospital patients with mild, moderate, and severe cognitive disturbances showing the role of neuropsychological testing, electroencephalography (EEG), and brain imaging in the neuropsychiatric assessment of primary and secondary mental illnesses. Neuropsychiatric evaluation helps to assess the peculiarities of movement disorder as a of side effects of regular psychiatric medications, e.g. the differences in diagnostic signs and treatment implication between Parkinson's disease and extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) as a side effect of neuroleptics as well as the development of abnormal reflexes as a sign of tardive dyskinesia (TD) not directly related to the lesion of upper motor neuron. The article also discusses the development of hypokinetic delirium in the course of treatment of psychiatric patients not only as a side effect of neuroleptics but also of anticonvulsants, increasingly used as the mood stabilizers in modern psychiatry. Since aggressive behavior of psychiatric patients represents one of the major criteria for admission and often long term treatment in a state hospital, special consideration is given to the role of brain paroxysmal activity in the development of aggressive behavior, especially rage attacks, one of the main manifestations of aggressive behavior in a state hospital patients. Correspondingly, the use of anticonvulsants in the treatment of rage attacks is discussed.

The self-reported vaccination rate during the previous season was 1.72%, indicating a 9.5-fold increase. Compared with physicians, significantly fewer technical personnel were vaccinated, whereas administrative personnel were more likely to receive the vaccine. Among clinicians, rates for internal medicine departments exceeded those of surgical departments by a factor of 2.71 and laboratory medicine departments by a factor of 2.36.

In recent years there has been an increasing policy interest among government departments, public and non-statutory agencies for the inclusion of FBOs as partners in health and welfare services. However, despite their long historical involvement in healing and healthcare, clergy are seldom viewed by mental health professionals as partners in healing and restitution but with suspicion [Koenig, 1988. Handbook of Religion and Mental Health San Diego: Academic Press; Larson, Hohmann, & Kessler, 1988. The couch and the cloth: The need for linkage. Hospital and Community Psychiatry, 39, 1064-1069]. This may be compounded by ignorance about mental health care provision within FBOs in the UK and the preparedness, confidence and willingness to undertake such care. This paper is based on a study which examined clergy contact with people with mental illness. Thirty-two interviews were conducted with male clergy (Christian ministers, rabbis, and imams) most of whom were London-based. We examine barriers and dilemmas for clergy in caring for people with mental illness. We found that they play an important but often confined role the scale and impact of which is not recognised by their central organisation and training bodies. Low confidence about managing psychiatric problems, underscored by anxiety, fear and stereotyped attitudes to mental illness restrain their willingness to formalise their function.

In this study, we have aimed to assess (1) the K-SADS-PL's acceptability to parents and children (2) the usefulness of the interview as perceived by the staff.\nFollowing the implementation of a semi-structured diagnostic interview in the standard assessment, parents, children, and staff were asked to fill in, anonymously, a brief questionnaire enquiring about their impression of the interview.\nParental satisfaction with the parent interview was very high. Parental satisfaction with the child interview was high as well, although a small group of children were reported to be more sad/hyperactive or difficult immediately after the interview. However, these were found among the younger children only, and mainly children with conduct problems. Most children found that the interview was a good or fairly good way to talk about how they felt, but more than half the children found the interview boring to some extent, and a few felt worse after the interview than they did before. The staff found the interview to be useful in most cases, primarily for diagnostic purposes.\nSemi-structured diagnostic interviews are well accepted by parents and children, and have good face validity among staff members. To young children with many conduct difficulties the interview may seem overwhelming, and future work should focus on ways of making diagnostic interviews more engaging for children."}, {"Title": "Diagnostic concordance of neurasthenia spectrum disorders in Pune, India.", "Abstract": "Clinically significant fatigue or weakness is a common but understudied clinical problem in India. The applicability and relevance of Western clinical criteria in this setting are not studied. Alternative criteria sets used in different clinical contexts suggest a range of conditions constituting neurasthenia spectrum disorders (NSDs). We therefore aimed to determine frequency of patients with these complaints in four specialty outpatient clinics of an urban general hospital. We compared the concordance of four diagnostic criteria sets of fatigue disorders among the same patients.\nPatients from the clinics of Psychiatry, Medicine, Dermatology, and Ayurved were screened for clinically significant fatigue or weakness and assessed for CFS, ICD-10 neurasthenia, DSM-IV draft criteria for neurasthenia, and CCMD-2 neurasthenia.\nFor 352 patients, sensitivity of CDC criteria for CFS (13.4%) was poorest. CFS was most frequent in the Medicine clinic. CCMD-2 criteria were the most frequently met (77.6%) with no significant difference across clinics. Two-way concordance of neurasthenia categories was no better than fair (< or =0.4) and few patients (8.0%) met criteria for all four categories.\nFour NSD criteria sets identified different clinical subgroups. CFS, considering fatigue and ignoring weakness, was least relevant for identifying NSD patients in these clinics. Poor concordance among the four diagnostic systems studied indicates the need for reviewing the nosology of these disorders. Focus on clinical significance alone is likely to avoid the discordant confusion arising from cross-cultural differences."}, {"Title": "Outcome of children with school refusal.", "Abstract": "To assess prospectively the psychiatric diagnostic status, psychosocial correlates, and short-term outcome of youngsters with school refusal.\nThirty-three subjects (8-16 years) presenting with school refusal to a tertiary Child and Adolescent Psychiatry service were evaluated.

Improving the quality of health care for mental and substance use conditions.", "Abstract": "In 2001, a seminal Institute of Medicine report, Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century, put forth a comprehensive strategy for improving the quality of U.S. health care. This strategy attained considerable traction within the overall U.S. health care system and subsequent attention in the mental health community as well. A new Institute of Medicine report, Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance Use Conditions, examines the quality chasm strategy in light of the distinctive features of mental and substance use health care, including concerns about patient decision-making abilities and coercion into care, a less developed quality measurement and improvement infrastructure, lagging use of information technology and participation in the development of the National Health Information Infrastructure, greater separations in care delivery accompanied by more restrictions on sharing clinical information, a larger number of provider types licensed to diagnose and treat, more solo practice, and a differently structured marketplace. This article summarizes the Institute of Medicine's analysis of these issues and recommendations for improving mental and substance use health care and discusses the implications for psychiatric practice and related advocacy efforts of psychiatrists, psychiatric organizations, and other leaders in mental and substance use health care."}, {"Title": "A survey of psychiatry residents' informed consent practices.", "Abstract": "A survey was used to investigate whether psychiatry residents obtained informed consent for treatment from 3 hypothetical patients.\nClinical vignettes describing 3 patients with (1) major depressive disorder being prescribed medication, (2) borderline personality disorder starting psychotherapy, and (3) neurotic character traits starting psychotherapy were distributed to psychiatry residents at 7 New York City-area training programs. Necessary components of an informed consent discussion were defined a priori by means of a literature review and consultation with experts in informed consent. Residents' responses to questions about the vignettes were then examined to determine whether the residents would engage in an informed consent discussion with the hypothetical patients. The study was conducted from January to March 2005.\n108 (49%) of 220 subjects reporting on a total of 324 vignettes returned the questionnaire. Responses to 8/324 vignettes met the minimal criteria established for an informed consent discussion. More residents reported they would initiate discussions with the depressed patient compared to the borderline and neurotic patients about diagnosis and prognosis, information about the recommended treatment, and side effects. A measure of what residents revealed about themselves to patients was also greater for the depressed patient compared to the borderline and neurotic patients. When the informed consent criteria were made less restrictive (requiring only that residents provide information in response to patients' questions rather than initiate the discussion), 173/324 vignette responses met the criteria.\nPsychiatry residents did not initiate informed consent discussions with the hypothetical patients in this study, but they reported that they would provide appropriate information when asked by the patients.

The participants and nonparticipants in a program of psychoeducation were compared for sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological characteristics. According to univariate statistics, a younger age, a higher education level, a shorter duration of illness, a better initial knowledge about lithium, and a less external locus of control were predictive of participation in the program.

The nosology of psychiatry had been conceptually confusing, difficult to apply, and bound to widely questioned theories. Psychiatry and clinical psychology had been struggling with their scientific status. DSM attempted to solve psychiatry's problems by making psychiatry more like its authors' perception of general medicine. It tried to avoid theory, especially psychoanalytic theories, by discussing only observable manifestations of disorders. But DSM is actually highly theory-bound. It implicitly and powerfully includes an exclusively \"medical\" model of psychological disturbance, while excluding other psychiatric ideas. Its authors tried to meet what they saw as \"scientific standards.\" To a surprising extent, DSM reflects its creators' personal distaste for psychoanalysis. The result is that DSM rests on a narrow philosophical perspective. The consequences of its adoption are widespread: it has profoundly affected drug development and other therapeutic studies, psychiatric education, attitudes toward patients, the public perception of psychiatry, and administrative and legal decisions. This article explores how DSM's most problematic features arise from its history in psychiatric controversies of the 1960s and its underlying positivistic philosophy."}, {"Title": "Individual and family eating patterns during childhood and early adolescence: an analysis of associated eating disorder factors.", "Abstract": "To examine whether there is an association between individual and family eating patterns during childhood and the likelihood of developing an eating disorder (ED) later in life.

All patients were consecutively admitted to our Psychiatry Department and were diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. Participants completed the Early Eating Environmental Subscale of the Cross-Cultural (Environmental) Questionnaire (CCQ), a retrospective measure of childhood eating attitudes and behaviours. In the control group, also the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) was used. During childhood and early adolescence, the following main factors were identified to be linked to eating disorders: eating excessive sweets and snacks and consuming food specially prepared for the respondent. Conversely, regular breakfast consumption was negatively associated with an eating disorder. Compared to healthy controls, eating disorder patients report unfavourable eating patterns early in life, which in conjunction with an excessive importance given to food by the individual and the family may increase the likelihood for developing a subsequent eating disorder."}, {"Title": "Clinical features of respiratory and nocturnal panic disorder subtypes.", "Abstract": "Our aim is to compare the panic disorder (PD) respiratory subtype and the nocturnal panic subtype.

The subtypes were the respiratory (with 4 out of 5 prominent respiratory symptoms during the panic attacks [PA]) vs. non-respiratory, likewise PD with nocturnal (during sleep) PAs vs. PD with only diurnal PAs. The respiratory subtype accounted for 56.5% (n=109) of our sample; the non-respiratory subtype, 43.5% (n=84); the nocturnal subtype, 49.2% (n=95); and the non-nocturnal subtype, 50.8% (n=98).

While largely successful in beating stigma and discrimination, these programmes have, in part, been criticized to be largely uninformed by the lived realities of people with mental illness and their families. Some critics claimed that anti-stigma efforts led by mental health professionals were in fact a concealed attempt at de-stigmatizing psychiatry itself as a profession. This paper will attempt to throw light on the various ways in which mental health professionals are 'entangled' in anti-stigma activities. It will outline the complex relationships between stigma and the psychiatric profession, presenting evidence on how its members can simultaneously be stigmatizers, stigma recipients and powerful agents of de-stigmatization. In exploring the role of mental health professionals as targets of stigma, new findings will be presented on the role of stigma as a professional stressor in psychiatry. Conclusions will be drawn on how the pursuit of professional self-interest can be a legitimate goal of anti-stigma programmes. Further, ways in which acknowledging psychiatry's own agenda can contribute to both credibility and success of fighting stigma from within psychiatry will be discussed."}, {"Title": "The stigma of mental illness: anticipation and attitudes among patients with epileptic, dissociative or somatoform pain disorder.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to survey the attitudes of 101 consecutive in- and out-patients with epileptic, dissociative or somatoform pain disorders (mean age: 43 [+/-11] years; 58% female) from either the Department of Psychiatry or Neurology toward anticipated mental illness stigma. The patients were administered a modified 12-item version of Links Stigma Questionnaire. Nearly 60% of all 101 patients believe that \"most people\" would not allow a mental patient \"to take care of their children\", \"most young women\" would be \"reluctant to date a man\" who has been treated for a mental illness and \"most employers would pass over\" the application of a psychiatric patient in favour of another applicant.

The medical field has seen many attempts by many investigators to pull summary data together from various sources within a discipline with the goal of making some definitive statement about the state of the science in that discipline. Likewise authors of manuscripts in the background and rationale section of their paper always summarize what they believe to be the state of affairs up to the time of the presentation of their own results in that particular paper. The new data and results they present in their current publication is an attempt to update the progress in that field. Thus in a sense they have performed a partial meta- analysis of summarizing information from the past, presenting their added contribution and thus updating the knowledge base. They have not quite integrated past data in a rigorous statistical way with their new data, but have merely used the data history to justify their current research which pretty much stands on its own. Thus meta-analysis is an after the fact attempt to pull together the current knowledge base whether it be publications or raw data and present a statistical synthesis of all the information and reach a conclusion as to the best treatment or intervention strategy based on all these past contributions. Now it's time to look back at some of these meta-analyses and determine what contributions, if any, they have made to the knowledge base within certain medical disciplines. Many disciplines including psychiatry have been visited by meta- analysis. One now examines some of these studies in the areas of oncology, orthopedics, psychiatry, pediatrics and cardiology. The purpose is to determine, given the information presented, what contributions, statistical challenges and peripheral issues in these disciplines have been brought to light in these meta- analyses."}, {"Title": "Can psychiatric intervention improve major depression in very near end-of-life cancer patients?", "Abstract": "Although depression is a prevalent and burdensome psychiatric problem in end-of-life cancer patients, little is known about its susceptibility to treatment, especially when patients reach very close to the end of life. This study was conducted to evaluate response rate of that end-of-life depression to psychiatric intervention and to assess the feasibility of conventional evidence-based pharmacological therapy for depression.\nThe medical records of 20 patients who were referred to the psychiatry division for major depressive disorder and died within 3 months after the referral were reviewed. The Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale was used for each case, and responders were defined as patients whose scores were much or very much improved. All pharmacological treatments were extracted, and the doses of the antidepressant prescribed were compared to their evidence-based-defined therapeutic doses.\nOf the 20 patients, seven were responders, but no response was achieved when the survival time was less than 3 weeks. Most patients were treated with antidepressants, but the doses prescribed were far less than the defined doses, especially the doses of the tricyclic antidepreSsants (TCAs).\nThese results suggested that patients' survival time largely determines susceptibility to psychiatric treatment, and it is hard to achieve response in patients whose survival time was less than about 1 month. Implementation of conventional evidence-based pharmacological treatment is difficult, especially with TCAs, and various antidepressants, which can be administrated by other routes, are needed when oral intake is impossible."}, {"Title": "Rethinking nurses' observations: psychiatric nursing skills and invisibility in an acute inpatient setting.", "Abstract": "In sociological, managerial and clinical investigations of psychiatric nursing, the skills of observing patients are compared unfavourably with nurses' ability to listen, to interview and to engage with patients. This paper examines how nurses in an acute psychiatry unit used observation as a significant part of their everyday assessments of patients, through a working shift. We argue that the knowledge generated in observations is essential to the nurses' gaze in this setting. Based on an ethnographic study of the assessment practices of 11 psychiatric nurses and the first author in an Australian hospital setting, we found that nurses' observations of patients were rich in situated assessment detail and a powerful strategy for producing civil conduct among patients. In particular, we noted how nurses deliberately obscured their practice of observation, in order not to provoke patients. While such discreet practice is productive for everyday clinical work, the invisibility of nursing observations undermines the status of acute inpatient psychiatric nurses. Devaluing of tacit practice may encourage experienced nurses to leave inpatient units, at a time when hospitals struggle to address nursing shortages worldwide.

Human and animal studies indicate that chronic alcohol consumption induces a persistent impairment in the ability of the HPA axis to respond to stress. Therefore, HPA axis abnormalities may contribute to the development of alcohol use disorders and may be a result of alcohol misuse. HPA axis interacts with serotonergic mechanisms. Hippocampal function is modulated by serotonergic projections mostly from dorsal raphe nucleus in the midbrain. Glucocorticoids modulate the activity of this raphe-hippocampal system in various ways. These effects are mediated via central corticosteroid receptors, which include glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors located in the hippocampus and in other cortical structures. An association between suicidal behavior and hyperactivity of the HPA axis has been suggested. An abnormal interaction between the HPA mechanisms and serotonergic systems may substantially contribute to suicidal behavior in adolescents, because abnormalities in HPA and serotonin functions may be inherited and may manifest at young age. Vulnerability to alcohol use disorders and suicide is likely to be due to multiple interacting genetic loci of small to modest effects. The identification and treatment of adolescents at risk for suicide is one of the most critical issues in adolescent psychiatry. The identification of alcohol and drug misuse is critical to the proper assessment of suicide risk in adolescents. HPA dysregulation may contribute to both alcohol abuse and suicidal behavior in adolescents. Studies of HPA function in alcohol abusing adolescents may lead to the development of new diagnostic tests for predisposition to suicidal behavior. Furthermore, study of biological markers may help us towards an understanding of the neurophysiological substrates of severe dysphoric mood states, alcohol and substance abuse, and suicidal behavior in adolescents."}, {"Title": "[Psychotropic medicines to patients with mental retardation].", "Abstract": "Psychotropic drugs are widely used by mentally retarded persons.

Psychiatric disorders and behaviour problems were the most common reasons for prescriptions. The effects and side effects were in most cases not recorded. Other types of treatment, such as analysis and adaptation of environmental factors, were seldom used. Specialists in habilitation and psychiatry were rarely involved in the treatment.\nMany individuals with mental retardation use psychotropic drugs. The survey indicates an increased use of these drugs after patients moving from institutions to community care. It also seems that treatment given at the institution was continued.

The combination of frequency, chronicity and severity make it, for some authors, the \"cancer of mental disorders\". However, according to the many cross-cultural studies, in particular, the two mammoth research projects of the WHO (IPSS and DOSMED, it is now irrefutable that the course and outcome of schizophrenia are better in patients from developing countries. The reasons for better outcome and more favorable course of schizophrenia in developing countries are still far from clear and remain speculative.\nWe have carried out a study among a population of schizophrenic patients admitted to our hospital during the past year, to question the issues of outcome, course and prognosis in Tunisia, which is an emerging country, ranking half-way between the most and the least developed countries.\nIt appears that the outcome of schizophrenia is similar to that of developed countries. A community survey reported an annual prevalence of 5.7 and an incidence of 3. 266 patients with schizophrenia were admitted between August 2003 and 2004, representing 40% of the whole hospitalized population; 80% were former patients who had been hospitalized an average of 8 times. One patient out of five will be readmitted at least once within the same year. Only 16.5% were married, and 10% had a regular job, in spite of a high level of education. A chronic course without remission is not unusual and long stay patients now account for a fourth of the hospital population.\nIt seems clearly and paradoxically that the course and outcome of schizophrenia is deteriorating and getting closer to what is observed in the industrialized societies. The same trend was observed in the western countries during the last centuries, leading some authors to claim that schizophrenia is a modern disease, which appeared in the XIX(e) century and spread in the XX(e). Besides, other than the controversy regarding the recent evolution of its incidence, it seems that we are not witnessing the anticipated decrease in incidence that comes with the therapeutic progress and the decline in fertility among individuals with schizophrenia.\nWe shall discuss three hypotheses to try to explain the aggravation of schizophrenia along with the economic development: the heterogeneity of the disease with two clinical presentations: a benign form (good prognosis), more frequent in developing countries, and a severe form, observed mainly in developed societies. The progress in medicine and gynecology-obstetrics, which contributes to the survival of patients with serious schizophrenia and the vulnerable newborn exposed to multiple assaults and risk factors related to birth. The progress in psychiatry that is selecting the more serious subtypes of schizophrenia, which are overrepresented today.

The results showed that the factors important for a good interaction could be summarised into two themes; prerequisites for a good interaction and interaction factors. Five prerequisites for a good interaction with persons who have undergone torture were found: personal characteristics, professional and therapeutic competence and support, language factors, time, and frames. Five factors in the interaction situation were important for a good interaction: cultural factors, treatments tailored to the patient's needs, to develop confidence and trust, religious factors, and capacity to handle negative emotions. All these factors have to be considered to improve the interaction between PTs and persons who have undergone torture."}, {"Title": "The price of a gift: an approach to receiving gifts from patients in psychiatric practice.", "Abstract": "When a patient or patient's family presents a psychiatrist with a gift, the clinician is challenged to maintain appropriate professional boundaries but have the flexibility to respond with warmth and appreciation. The psychiatrist must consider such factors as the intention of the gift, its value to the patient, and the anticipated effect of accepting or refusing it on the patient and the treatment. Psychiatric practitioners are ethically obligated to consider patients' best interests when deciding about how to handle the offer of a gift. Ethical deliberations about such situations occur on a case-by-case basis and require careful analysis of how to promote the patient's best interest while adhering to professional ethics. In this article, members of the McLean Hospital Ethics Committee present a pragmatic model for managing the presentation of a gift from a patient or a patient's family member. The pragmatic model, which focuses on the practical results of accepting or declining the gift, minimizes the risk of exploiting the patient by accepting a gift or hurting the patient by declining it. We present five clinical cases that raise ethical dilemmas concerning patient gift giving in psychiatry and discuss each case from the standpoint of the pragmatic model."}, {"Title": "Effect of a specialist eating disorders service on the knowledge and attitudes of local health professionals.", "Abstract": "This study investigated the effect of a specialist eating disorders service on the attitudes and knowledge of local healthcare professionals. A questionnaire was sent to fully qualified psychiatrists, postgraduate trainees in psychiatry and general (internal) medicine, general practitioners (family physicians) and dietitians in two comparable cities: Leicester (which had a specialist eating disorders service) and Nottingham (which did not). Psychiatrists in training in Leicester had a greater knowledge of eating disorders than those in Nottingham. There was greater satisfaction with services in Leicester but no difference in attitudes. The presence of a local eating disorders service enhances postgraduate training and increases knowledge."}, {"Title": "Continued antidepressant treatment and suicide in patients with depressive disorder.", "Abstract": "Antidepressant use in Denmark, as in many developed countries, has substantially increased during recent years, coinciding with a decreasing suicide rate. In a nationwide observational cohort study with linkage of registers of all prescribed antidepressants and recorded suicides in Denmark from 1995 to 2000, we investigated the relation between continued treatment with antidepressants and suicide in a population of all patients discharged from hospital psychiatry with a diagnosis of depressive disorder. Patients discharged from hospital psychiatry with a diagnosis of depressive disorder had a highly increased rate of suicide. Those who continued treatment with antidepressants had a decreased rate of suicide compared with those who purchased antidepressants once (rate ratio: 0.31, 95% confidence interval: 0.26-0.36). Further, the rate of suicide decreased consistently with the number of prescriptions. On individualized data from a cohort of patients with a known history of depressive disorder, continued antidepressant treatment was associated with reduced risk of suicide."}, {"Title": "Physician attitudes toward treatment of depression in older medical inpatients.", "Abstract": "To better understand low treatment (<50%) and psychiatry referral rates (<10%) of depressed older medical patients, we examined medical physicians' characteristics, attitudes and practices regarding treatment.\nPhysicians caring for a consecutive series of 1000 depressed older patients during medical hospitalization and/or after discharge were asked about their general attitudes and behaviors related to the treatment of depression in older patients.\nOf 422 physicians responding to questionnaires, less than half (48%) usually started more than two patients a month on antidepressants. Even fewer (14%) referred more than two patients a month for counseling; 37% usually referred none. Only 11% referred more than two patients a month to psychiatrists; nearly 40% usually referred none. Antidepressants, counseling, and psychiatric referral were seldom thought very effective. Physicians out of their training and those in primary care specialties (especially family practice) were more likely to treat patients. Common reasons for not treating these patients were perceived resistance to treatment (62.3%), lack of time (61.1%), uncertainty of depression diagnosis (56.2%), belief that patients couldn't afford treatment (50.5%), and concern about medication/disease interactions (58.8%). One-third (33.5%) emphasized that they were unsure about treatment effectiveness and one-third (34.4%) that they were poorly prepared to treat depression in older patients. Non-white physicians were more likely to refer to psychiatrists.\nMany older depressed patients in medical settings are not treated or referred. Physician experience and specialty may affect the decision to treat, and physician race may affect the decision to seek consultation. Therapeutic nihilism may be influential."}, {"Title": "Gene-environment correlations: a review of the evidence and implications for prevention of mental illness.", "Abstract": "Family studies have demonstrated genetic influences on environmental exposure: the phenomenon of gene-environment correlation (rGE). A few molecular genetic studies have confirmed the results, but the identification of rGE in studies that measure genes and environments faces several challenges. Using examples from studies in psychology and psychiatry, we integrate the behavioral and molecular genetic literatures on rGE, describe challenges in identifying rGE and discuss the implications of molecular genetic findings of rGE for future research on gene-environment interplay and for attempts to prevent disease by reducing environmental risk exposure. Genes affect environments indirectly, via behavior and personality characteristics. Associations between individual genetic variants and behaviors are typically small in magnitude, and downstream effects on environmental risk are further attenuated by behavioral mediation. Genotype-environment associations are most likely to be detected when the environment is behaviorally modifiable and highly specified and a plausible mechanism links gene and behavior. rGEs play an important causal role in psychiatric illness. Although research efforts should concentrate on elucidating the genetic underpinnings of behavior rather than the environment itself, the identification of rGE may suggest targets for environmental intervention even in highly heritable disease. Prevention efforts must address the possibility of confounding between rGE and gene-environment interaction (G x E)."}, {"Title": "Depression in Dhat syndrome.", "Abstract": "Dhat syndrome is a widely recognized clinical condition in the Indian subcontinent characterized by excessive preoccupation with semen loss as the main presenting complaint. This condition has been considered to be a culture-bound syndrome, and depressive symptoms have previously been reported. We were interested to know how common depression is, and to quantify these features.\nWe studied 30 patients attending the Psychiatry Outpatient Department of a tertiary care hospital for their complaints about passing of semen in urine frequently. Those with depressive symptoms were further evaluated using the fourth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) Diagnostic Criteria for Depression, and depression severity was assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Patients meeting the criteria were started on capsule fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in dose of 20-40 mg per day. Patients were periodically followed fortnightly and were reevaluated for therapeutic response using the HAM-D.\nA total of 30 patients (age = 20-40 years; mean age = 29 years; mean age of onset = 19 years; mean duration of illness = 11 months) were studied. The majority of cases were unmarried (64.2%) and educated till 5th class or above (70%). Twenty out of 30 (66%) patients met DSM-IV Diagnostic Criteria for Depression. Ten patients (33.3%) were found to have a comorbid problem of premature ejaculation, and two patients reported erectile dysfunction (6.6%). Patients showed statistically significant therapeutic response to fluoxetine.\nDepressive phenomenology meeting DSM-IV Diagnostic Criteria for Depression seems common in Dhat syndrome and responds to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors along with regular counseling."}, {"Title": "Laryngeal dyskinesia: an under-recognized condition.", "Abstract": "To perform a review of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of laryngeal dyskinesia.\nA search of the Medline database from 1966 to 2003 was performed. A manual search was performed of the references of each article.\nLaryngeal dyskinesia is a respiratory condition characterized by abnormal vocal cord adduction and airflow limitation at the level of the larynx in the absence of evidence of local organic disease. It typically presents to the ED as wheeze, stridor or apparent upper airway obstruction. It occurs across a wide age range, is more common in females, and is typically associated with a range of underlying psychopathologies. Diagnosis is often delayed and unnecessary emergency treatment such as intubation and tracheostomy is not uncommon. Patients are commonly on high-dose steroids and are frequent users of the health-care system, often over prolonged periods. There are multiple diagnostic features on history and examination, and flexible nasendoscopy of the vocal cords in the ED can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment options in the ED include sedation and use of continuous positive airway pressure. Long-term treatment involves a multidisciplinary approach involving respiratory physicians/ear, nose and throat surgeons, speech therapy and psychiatry.\nLaryngeal dyskinesia remains an under-appreciated cause of respiratory presentations to the ED. Emergency physicians are ideally placed to make the diagnosis and initiate appropriate referral for specific therapies that have a high level of success."}, {"Title": "Surrogate marker evaluation from an information theory perspective.", "Abstract": "The last 20 years have seen lots of work in the area of surrogate marker validation, partly devoted to frame the evaluation in a multitrial framework, leading to definitions in terms of the quality of trial- and individual-level association between a potential surrogate and a true endpoint (Buyse et al., 2000, Biostatistics 1, 49-67). A drawback is that different settings have led to different measures at the individual level. Here, we use information theory to create a unified framework, leading to a definition of surrogacy with an intuitive interpretation, offering interpretational advantages, and applicable in a wide range of situations. Our method provides a better insight into the chances of finding a good surrogate endpoint in a given situation. We further show that some of the previous proposals follow as special cases of our method. We illustrate our methodology using data from a clinical study in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Relationships between silicon content and glutathione peroxidase activity in tissues of rats receiving lithium in drinking water.", "Abstract": "Lithium salts are widely used in psychiatry, but their presence in organism can result in both beneficial and adverse effects. Silicon, the third most abundant trace element in humans as well as antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPx) play important roles in organism. The disturbance of their level can cause severe disorders. The aim of our work was to evaluate the influence of Li2CO3 administration in drinking water for a period of 4 weeks on Si content and GPx activity in the tissues of liver, kidney, brain and femoral muscle in rats. The concentrations of provided solutions were 0.7, 1.4, 2.6, 3.6, 7.1 and 10.7 mmol Li+ x dm-3. GPx activity was decreased versus control as a consequence of Li treatment, particularly in kidney and brain. This effect could be suggested to contribute to renal abnormalities which could occur during Li therapy. Si tissue level was significantly enhanced versus control in liver and femoral muscle in groups receiving high Li doses. In brain no well-marked changes were observed, whereas in kidney we observed the depletion in low-Li-groups, restoration of Si level in higher-Li-groups and unexpected decrease in the highest-Li-group. Positive correlations between Si content and GPx activity in the tissues of kidney (r = 0.677) and brain (r = 0.790) as well as negative correlation (r = -0.819) in femoral muscle were found. We consider that our results give some reason for suggesting that monitoring of silicon level in patients undergoing Li therapy could be recommended. However, more investigations should be performed, particularly regarding the relationships between Si and GPx in blood and urine Si excretion during lithium administration."}, {"Title": "Psychotropic drug prescribing in child and adolescent learning disability psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This postal questionnaire study investigated the prescribing practices of a group of senior British psychiatrists who have responsibilities for children and adolescents with learning disabilities (mental retardation). The study revealed that all of the clinicians surveyed (n = 16) were prescribing psychotropic medication; psychostimulants and major tranquillizers represented the most frequently prescribed classes and, respectively, methylphenidate, risperidone, melatonin, sodium valproate and carbamazepine were the most frequently employed specific agents. Most patients were receiving monotherapy. Many (14/16) clinicians reported difficulties in shared-care prescribing arrangements with General Practitioners. The study concludes that psychopharmacology is an established part of the psychiatric management of learning disabled children but acknowledges the need for the elaboration of clinical governance standards to this area of practice."}, {"Title": "The sensitivity and psychometric properties of a brief computer-based cognitive screening battery in a depression clinic.", "Abstract": "At present, there is poor accuracy in assessing cognitive and vegetative symptoms in depression using clinician or self-rated measures, suggesting the need for development of standardized tasks to assess these functions. The current study assessed the psychometric properties and diagnostic specificity of a brief neuropsychological screening battery designed to assess core signs of depression; psychomotor retardation, attention and executive functioning difficulties, and impaired emotion perception within an outpatient psychiatry setting. Three hundred eighty-four patients with mood disorders and 77 healthy volunteers participated. A large percentage of patients met diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder alone (49%) or with another comorbid psychiatric disorder (24%). A brief, 25-min battery of computer-based tests was administered to control participants and patients measuring the constructs of inhibitory control, attention, visual perception, and both executive and visual processing speed. The patient groups performed significantly worse than the control group regardless of diagnosis on visual perception and attention accuracy and processing speed factors. Surprisingly, the anxiety disorder group performed better than several other psychiatric disorder groups in inhibitory control accuracy. Developing valid and reliable measures of cognitive signs in mood disorders creates excellent opportunities for tracking cognitive status prior to initiation of treatment, and allows for reliable retest following treatment."}, {"Title": "An empirical study of countertransference reactions toward patients with personality disorders.", "Abstract": "The study examined to what extent patients with cluster A + B personality disorders (PDs) evoked other countertransference reactions among psychotherapists compared with patients with cluster C PDs as well as the relationship between the different countertransference reactions and outcome.\nA total of 11 therapists at the Department for Personality Psychiatry, Ullevaal University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, filled out the Feeling Word Checklist-58 (FWC-58), 2 weeks after admission and 2 weeks before discharge, for 71 patients admitted to the day treatment program. The patients were diagnosed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders (SCID-II).\nThe study revealed that patients with cluster A + B PDs evoked more negative and less positive countertransference reactions than those with cluster C PDs. The psychotherapists varied significantly more in their reported countertransference reactions toward patients with cluster A + B PDs than toward those with cluster C PDs. Patients who dropped out of treatment evoked significantly more negative countertransference reactions after 2 weeks than patients who completed the treatment. In addition, the study revealed strong correlations between countertransference feelings and change during the treatment.\nThis empirical study confirms clinical narratives on specified relationships between countertransference reactions, different PDs, and treatment course."}, {"Title": "Noninvasive human brain stimulation.", "Abstract": "Noninvasive brain stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is valuable in research and has potential therapeutic applications in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, psychiatry, and neurology. TMS allows neurostimulation and neuromodulation, while tDCS is a purely neuromodulatory application. TMS and tDCS allow diagnostic and interventional neurophysiology applications, and focal neuropharmacology delivery. However, the physics and basic mechanisms of action remain incompletely explored. Following an overview of the history and current applications of noninvasive brain stimulation, we review stimulation device design principles, the electromagnetic and physical foundations of the techniques, and the current knowledge about the electrophysiologic basis of the effects. Finally, we discuss potential biomedical and electrical engineering developments that could lead to more effective stimulation devices, better suited for the specific applications."}, {"Title": "The boomers are coming: a total cost of care model of the impact of population aging on the cost of chronic conditions in the United States.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to estimate the impact of population aging on medical costs over the next five decades in the United States. Specifically, we focus on the impact of aging on the chronic and/or expensive conditions most often included in disease management programs: coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes, asthma, pregnancy, psychiatry, and chemical dependency. We apply estimated age-, gender-, and condition-specific annualized costs to the projected US population in each age and gender group for future years, through 2050, to provide an estimate of future healthcare costs. The primary data sources are pooled claims and membership for 2002 and 2003 for HealthPartners, a large midwestern health plan. Secondary sources are US annualized medical costs for 2003 and US Census Bureau demographic projections for the next five decades. Using the Episodes Treatment Group (ETG) grouper from Symmetry, we grouped HealthPartners data into 574 clinically meaningful episodes of care units. We then aggregate selected ETGs into the conditions reported in this study. Using data for all types of health services, we find that aging will have a greater impact on per capita costs for diseases where the ratio of costs for older versus younger ages is greater, such as CHF, CAD, and diabetes. In addition, we project that aging of the US population will actually reduce per capita costs for pregnancy and infertility, chemical dependency, and psychiatric conditions. Aging will have more of an impact on care for specific chronic diseases. These projections can inform health policy and planning as providers of health care, health plans, disease management vendors, and the government anticipate meeting future US healthcare needs."}, {"Title": "Is courage the counterpoint of demoralization?", "Abstract": "To consider the role courage plays in our ability to cope with threat and adversity, especially the role of courage in understanding demoralization and dignity.\nBy exploring standard psychiatric texts and Aristotle's concept of courage and virtue. A review of Medline and PsycINFO provided few relevant documents, reflecting the paucity of research on the concept of courage in psychiatry, palliative care, and psycho-oncology.\nCourage is an important precursor to maintaining morale and therefore may play a critical causative role in demoralization. Courage is also intimately related to the concepts of self-esteem, free will, and personal values in life. The utility of the concept of courage is that it enables a response to a difficult circumstance. The main drawback of courage in a therapeutic sense is that it is often linked with cowardice, which has a pejorative connotation and is notoriously difficult to diagnose."}, {"Title": "Elucidating Tourette's syndrome: perspectives from hypnosis, attention and self-regulation.", "Abstract": "Biological psychiatry favors drug treatment over non-pharmacological intervention and shapes the way clinicians both treat and understand Tourette's Syndrome (TS). However, drug treatments for TS involve side effects and are potentially toxic to the central nervous system. Moreover, current pharmacological treatments are largely ineffective and at best only provide a modest symptom reduction. In this paper, we describe how non-pharmacological treatments such as focused attention can modulate, reduce, or indeed entirely eliminate the symptoms of TS as well as elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms. Showing that the symptoms of TS are susceptible to self-regulatory interventions such as hypnosis, we propose that attentional training could be used to both treat the disorder and better understand it."}, {"Title": "[Delusional disorder in a chronic renal dialysis patient--deprivation and reclaiming of body and narrative].", "Abstract": "We report a female case treated with hemodialysis over 20 years who demonstrated good social functioning, until she suffered from delusional disorder with persecutory delusions involving medical staff performing the dialysis and also auditory hallucinations involving them. We examined the bio-psycho-social invasiveness of the renal dialysis treatment, especially concerning the effects on the patient's self-image of her body resulting in the loss of a feeling of unity between her mind and body, or the sense of her body belonging to her, referring to J. Lacan's concept of \"corps imaginaire= imaginary body\". We supposed the situation of \"body deprivation\" on the ground of the patient's behavior when she developed persecutory delusions that the medical staff were trying to deprive her of her ideal body. In this case, her persecutory delusions should be regarded as a reclaim for her right not to be deprived of her self-body. We pointed out the general situation which the hegemony of modern medicine over patients brings about, where patients are deprived of chances to express their personal feelings about their illness and be listened to attentively by medical staffs. We recognized such a situation in the present patient and described the situation as \"narrative deprivation\". Her delusions seemed to have the aspect of the claim for her rebelling against the narrative deprivation. We emphasized the role of psychiatric staff to confirm the existence of the body-narrative deprivation situation on the side of the patient and listen attentively to the patient's personal narrative of illness in the practice of consultation-liaison psychiatry, especially when performing therapy in patients with persecutory delusions involving medical staff."}, {"Title": "Prophylactic treatment response in bipolar disorder: results of a naturalistic observation study.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate effectiveness of commonly used prophylactic treatments for bipolar disorder in a naturalistic setting and to explore factors associated with treatment response.\nWe reviewed charts of 120 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. The sample consisted of 37 males and 83 females, in the age range of 20 to 81 years (mean age 45+/-14 years), treated at an outpatient psychiatry program in a teaching hospital. In contrast to controlled clinical trials, we did not exclude subjects with co-morbid conditions and/or substance abuse. Treatment outcome was evaluated using a scale for retrospective assessment of prophylactic treatment response. The scale rates the degree of improvement in the course of treatment weighted by the likelihood of response being attributable to the treatment. The inter-reliability of the assessments was good with concordance of ratings of 90% and weighted kappa of 0.8.\nRates of full response to individual mood stabilizers were: lithium 30%, carbamazepine 0%, valproate 13%, lamotrigine 11%, and olanzapine 25%. Lithium responders were more likely to be bipolar II, and had a typically episodic course of illness with earlier onset in comparison with non-responders. Responders to valproate had higher rates of psychosis.\nData were obtained by chart reviews.\nLess than one-third of patients treated with lithium achieved remission; the effectiveness of other treatments in this naturalistic sample was even lower."}, {"Title": "[Prejudice and evidence, oppositions and convergencies in today's psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The notion of prejudice in epistemology starts in the early times of modern thought, together with the first reflections on science.

A group of 521 successively admitted psychiatric in-patients was investigated at admission with the help of the \"Social Dysfunction and Aggression Scale\". A slightly higher frequency and intensity of \"verbal aggressive behavior\" was observed in males. Within the other categories of aggressive behavior (\"tension\", \"physical violence to things\", and \"assaults\"), however, the percentages and intensities of gender-related aggressive behavior did not differ significantly. Furthermore, under the covarying impact of various psychiatric diagnoses, the gender-related differences concerning the intensity of \"verbal aggressive behavior\" disappeared. When comparing male and female subgroups, it was notable that male schizophrenic patients were younger than female patients when displaying comparable risks of showing at least one kind of aggressive behavior. In addition, in the female subgroup, \"self-injurious behavior\" was more strongly correlated to the category \"tension\" than in the male subgroup. Although there are some methodological shortcomings, the present results show that there are small qualitative differences in gender-related aggressive behavior in addition to minimal quantitative differences in the frequency and intensity of \"verbal aggressive behavior\" at admission."}, {"Title": "[Random sampling according to section 17 c KHG--report on the experience of maximal care hospitals in Hesse].", "Abstract": "Hospital billing converted to \"German diagnosis-related groups\" (G-DRG) for in-patient treatment in Germany is reviewed, except in psychiatry where per-diems are still in use.

The structure and the meaning of SOC for a person's ability to cope with stress are discussed as well as the overall health-promoting effect of SOC. At the end of the study's first part the question of proving the SOC empirically and of the SOC's construct validity are critically discussed. The second part of the article demonstrates the relevance of salutogenic mechanisms for psychiatry and neurology, especially regarding the social aspects of both disciplines. Health promotion and disease prevention are already important issues in the Mental Health Community. But also in neurology, which is much more grounded in the physical medicine than psychiatry, the concept of salutogenesis can help patients to prevent illness or to cope better with the consequences of diseases. Finally, the necessity to supply the current health care system in psychiatry and neurology with much more salutogenic input is questioned."}, {"Title": "Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging of pediatric twins.", "Abstract": "To explore the relative impact of genetic and nongenetics factors on human brain anatomy during childhood and adolescence development, a collaborative team from the Child Psychiatry Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health and Virginia Commonwealth University is applying structural equation modeling to brain morphometric data acquired via magnetic resonance imaging from a large sample of monozygotic and dizygotic pediatric subjects. In this report, we discuss methodologic issues related to pediatric neuroimaging twin studies and synthesize results to date from the project. Current sample size from the ongoing longitudinal study is approximately 150 twin pairs. Consistent themes are: (1) heritability is high and shared environmental effects low for most brain morphometric measures; (2) the cerebellum has a distinct heritability profile; (3) genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of the cortex in a regional and age specific manner; and (4) shared genetic effects account for more of the variance than structure specific effects. Understanding of influences on trajectories of brain development may shed light on the emergence of psychopathology during childhood and adolescence and ultimately may guide therapeutic interventions."}, {"Title": "Validity of a 'proxy' for the deficit syndrome derived from the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia patients with the deficit syndrome (DS) may represent a homogeneous subgroup. To increase the practicability of diagnosing the DS, Kirkpatrick et al. [Kirkpatrick, B., Buchanan, RW., Breier, A. Carpenter, WT., 1993. Case identification and stability of the deficit syndrome of schizophrenia. Psychiatry Res. 47, 47-56.] proposed the use of a 'proxy' case identification tool using standardized symptom ratings instead of the Schedule for the Deficit Syndrome (SDS) which requires an independent clinical assessment. The Proxy for the Deficit Syndrome (PDS) is based on the extraction of symptoms that are essentially equivalent or overlap substantially with the restricted affect and diminished emotional range on the SDS. Kirkpatrick et al. [Kirkpatrick, B., Buchanan, RW., Breier, A. Carpenter, WT., 1993. Case identification and stability of the deficit syndrome of schizophrenia. Psychiatry Res. 47, 47-56.] reported good sensitivity and specificity in a comparison of SDS and PDS assessments among 100 chronic schizophrenia outpatients. The present investigation involves the comparison of the deficit syndrome as assessed by the \"gold standard\" Schedule for the Deficit Syndrome with the ratings of the same symptoms embodied in the \"proxy instrument\" the PANSS, within the same group of 156 inpatients. Forty-four patients were assessed by the SDS to have the deficit syndrome. Patients with and without the DS, as defined by the SDS, did not differ for age, education, age at illness onset and duration of illness. The two main 'proxy' measures PDS1 and PDS2 discriminated across the SDS groups. The direct dichotomous comparison of the actual SDS and the 'proxy' derived PDS groups demonstrated good specificity (78.6% and 79.5%) and moderate to very good sensitivity (61.4% and 86.4%) and there was a moderately low rate of false positive cases (21.4% and 20.5%). For the two main 'proxy' measures (PDS1 and PDS2) kappas were .38 and .59, representing poor to good agreement. In our sample of rigorously diagnosed schizophrenia inpatients, the use of a 'proxy' case identification tool for the deficit syndrome would appear to be a viable alternative in identifying a subgroup of schizophrenia patients with the deficit syndrome when the use of the actual SDS is not feasible. Further study is indicated before the PDS as extracted from the PANSS can be used in lieu of the SDS for identifying patients with this syndrome."}, {"Title": "Caregiver commitment to foster children: the role of child behavior.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to examine the association between child behavior problems and caregiver commitment to their child in a group of young foster children.\nThe sample consisted of 102 caregiver-child dyads from the greater Baltimore area.

Referred children received a neuropaediatric evaluation, and the effect of the information program on recorded FAS/FASD was recorded.\nBased on the national survey, a prevalence of 0.3 per 1000 was calculated. After the information program, the estimated prevalence in Hordaland County increased to 1.5 per 1000. In 5 years, 25 children were diagnosed with FAS and 22 with FASD. One-third of all children were mentally retarded. Microcephaly and neuroimpairments were more common among FAS children. Almost all children met the criteria of ADHD.\nThe rate of FAS/FASD may be greatly underestimated because of lack of knowledge.

Risperidone, an effective first-line atypical antipsychotic agent, exhibits a relatively high affinity for this receptor. Recent studies have reported an association of the Ser9Gly polymorphism in the DRD3 gene with therapeutic response to risperidone, but the results were inconsistent. We therefore postulated that the Ser9Gly polymorphism might be in linkage disequilibrium with an undetected variant that exerts a direct influence on risperidone efficacy. The present study genotyped eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed throughout the DRD3 gene and examined five of these for association with treatment outcome, following an 8-week period of risperidone monotherapy in 130 schizophrenic patients from mainland China. Clinical symptoms were assessed before and after the treatment period, using the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS). The confounding effects of non-genetic factors were estimated and the baseline symptom score was included as a covariate for adjustment. Neither was any association observed between the five polymorphisms and improvement in total BPRS scores nor was any combined effect of these variants detected in the haplotype analysis. The current results indicate that genetic variations within the DRD3 gene may not contribute significantly to interindividual differences in the therapeutic efficacy of risperidone."}, {"Title": "Roman concept of mental capacity to make end-of-life decisions.", "Abstract": "When assessing decisional competence of patients, psychiatrists have to balance the patients' right to personal autonomy, their condition and wishes against principles of medical ethics and professional discretion. This article explores the age-old legal and ethical dilemmas posed by refusal of vital medical treatment by patients and their mental capacity to make end-of-life decisions against the background of philosophical, legal and medical approaches to these issues in the time of the Younger Pliny (c62-c113 CE). Classical Roman discourse regarding mental competency and \"voluntary death\" formed an important theme of the vast corpus of Greco-Roman writings, which was moulded not only by legal permissibility of suicide but also by philosophical (in modern terms, moral or ethical) considerations. Indeed, the legal and ethical issues of evaluating the acceptability of end of life decisions discussed in the Letters are as pertinent today as they were 2000 years ago. We may gain valuable insights about our own methodologies and frames of reference in this area of the law and psychiatry by examining Classical Roman approaches to evaluating acceptability of death-choices as described in Pliny's Letters and the writings of some of his peers."}, {"Title": "Improvement of psychosocial adjustment to HIV-1 infection through a cognitive-behavioral oriented group psychotherapy program: a pilot study.", "Abstract": "The present study evaluated the efficacy of a group therapy program in improving psychosocial adjustment to HIV infection, and tried to identify variables predictive of greater improvement. The outcome of 47 completing patients was analyzed, comparing the measures between T1 (1 month before therapy), and T2 (first session), and between T2 and T3 (last session) using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test for each dimension of the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS). The therapy consisted of 16 weekly 2-hour sessions following a structured time-limited cognitive-behavioral group psychotherapy program. During the intervention (between T2 and T3) a significant improvement was observed in health care orientation, vocational environment, domestic environment, sexual relation, extended family relationships, social environment, and total PAIS. There were no changes during baseline (between T1 and T2) in any of the PAIS subscales, or in the total PAIS score. Sexual route of transmission was independently associated with an improvement in health care orientation (beta = 2.525). Time since HIV diagnosis (beta = 0.022) and being employed (beta = 2.548) were independently associated with an improvement in adjustment to vocational environment. Men who have sex with men showed a poorer improvement in adjusting to family relations after the intervention (beta = -2.548). Finally, a lower CD4 count (beta = -0.005) and being employed (beta = 3.054) were independently associated with an improvement in adjustment to social environment.

The concept of resilience represents a new paradigm in the field of clinical psychology. It puts into perspective determinist models, whether they be psychological (experiences incurred during the first years of life forever seal the destiny of a subject) or biological (an individual is defined by his/her genes). It permits the study of an individual according to his/her resources and no longer according to his/her faults. Nevertheless, for several years, resilience has suffered from its own success by being frequently used in inappropriate contexts. With the aim of better understanding this concept and of avoiding its determinist and normative distortion, we present here a review of the different factors (psychological, family, sociological and biological factors) contributing to the process of resilience. Moreover, in the discussion, we present some methodological and conceptual issues presented by the concept of resilience."}, {"Title": "[Gender, qualifications and choice of specialty of younger physicians in Denmark 1998-2003].", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to describe differences in specialty choices and qualifications between male and female physicians at the start of their residency in Denmark 1998-2003.\nData consist of all applications for residency in the period 1998-2003 in 21 medical specialties. 1,920 physicians in residency are included in the study. Their gender is compared with specialty choices, age and points achieved on supplementary criteria.\nOver 80% of the residents in child and youth psychiatry and gynaecology/obstetrics were women. 87% of the residents in orthopaedic surgery were men. No gender differences were found in biological age and candidate age at the start of residency. Women achieved higher points for clinical qualification and theoretical courses, while the male residents achieved the highest points for scientific and pedagogical qualification. Within the individual medical specialties there were no gender differences.\nGender does not have independent influence on achieved residency, but the study shows that there are gender differences in specialty choice and in the way men and women qualify for residency. The clear differences between men and woman across medical specialties are not matched by similar differences within each specialty. Gender differences thus seem determined by differences in specialty choice. The study results can help create the basis for the future medical residency and can guide the considerations of specialty societies, young physicians and other interested parties with regard to recruitment and specialty profile."}, {"Title": "Kleine-Levin syndrome: interface between neurology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "We report the first episode of Kleine-Levin (KLS) syndrome in a 17-year-old male.

In this study, we aimed to compare hospital stay and admissions to hospital in patients switching from first-generation (conventional) to second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics with patients switching from one first-generation drug to another. This was a retrospective, 6-year, controlled mirror-image study conducted in an acute general psychiatry services in an inner-city area. Subjects were consisted of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder receiving continuous prescription of antipsychotics over at least a 6-year period between 1994 and 2002. The main outcome measures were number of days spent in hospital and number of admissions to hospital. In 36 patients switched from first to second-generation antipsychotics, total number of days spent in hospital increased, from a mean of 90 days in the 3 years before switching, to a mean of 200 days in the 3 years after (P<0.001). Mean number of admissions did not change significantly (1.61 before vs. 1.44 after, P=0.360).

Surgery and radiology also are taught longitudinally, grounded in the clinical experiences of a cohort of patients and in a brief immersion experience working directly with an attending surgeon. Students participate in weekly, case-based tutorials integrating instruction in the basic sciences with training to address the common and important issues in medicine, as identified by national organizations. In addition, they participate in a social science curriculum that focuses on self-reflection, communication skills, ethics, population sciences, and cultural competence. In the pilot year (July 2004 to July 2005), HMS-CIC students performed at least as well as traditional students in tests of content knowledge and skills, as measured by National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Subject Exams and the fourth-year Objective Structured Clinical Exam, and they scored higher on a year-end comprehensive clinical skills self-assessment examination, suggesting that they retained content knowledge better. From surveys, HMS-CIC students were much more likely to see patients before diagnosis and after discharge and to receive feedback and mentoring from experienced faculty than were their traditionally educated peers.

The enzyme is encoded by the COMT gene. COMT is located (along with 47 other genes) in a fragment of chromosome 22q11 which when deleted results in a complex syndrome, the psychiatric manifestations of which include schizophrenia and other psychoses. These 2 observations have placed COMT near the top of a rather long list of plausible candidate genes for schizophrenia. The ability to test the hypothesis that COMT might be a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia has been simplified in principle by the existence of a valine-to-methionine (Val/Met) polymorphism which results respectively in high and low activity forms of the enzyme. Given the unequivocal effect of this polymorphism on the function of COMT, and the evidence for a critical role for dopamine in the pathophysiology and treatment of psychosis, there are strong prior expectations that Val/Met influences susceptibility to schizophrenia as well as other psychiatric phenotypes. Indeed the Val/Met polymorphism has become the most widely studied polymorphism in psychiatry. In this review, we consider the evidence for and against the involvement of COMT in schizophrenia. The current data allow us to virtually exclude a simple relationship between schizophrenia and the Val/Met variant previously thought to dominate COMT function. However, recent data suggest a more complex pattern of genetic regulation of COMT function beyond that attributable to the Val/Met locus. Moreover, it is also clear that there is a complex nonlinear relationship between dopamine availability and brain function. These 2 factors, allied to phenotypic complexity within schizophrenia, make it difficult to draw strong conclusions regarding COMT in schizophrenia. Nevertheless, emerging research that takes greater account of all these levels of complexity is beginning to provide tantalizing, but far from definitive, support for the view that COMT influences susceptibility to at least some forms of psychosis."}, {"Title": "[Development of the concept of identity in psychiatry and philosophy].", "Abstract": "The present paper discusses possible solutions to the problem of personal identity and intends to demonstrate criteria enabling us to view a person as the same at different time points in his life.

We were interested in the two positive sites reported and selected five variants among the promoter region of ADRA1A, namely -563G/A, -9625G/A, -2760C/A, -4155G/C and a new substitution we detected between -508bp and -530bp upstream of the translation initiation site. Our sample consisted of 480 schizophrenia and 480 control subjects. All recruits were Han Chinese in Shanghai origin.

A prerequisite for lithium administration in patients with bipolar disorder is the patient 's cooperation, in order to ensure monitoring of drug plasma levels as well as thyroid and renal function. Lithium-related renal complications include impairment in renal concentrating ability resulting in polyuria, increase of plasma creatinine levels and, more rarely, renal insufficiency. In this paper we present the case of a patient with bipolar disorder, who developed chronic renal insufficiency after 25 years of treatment with lithium."}, {"Title": "[Liaison child psychiatry and the interpersonal relationships in the context of the general child hospital].", "Abstract": "The staff of a big general hospital is a community of people with all the alliances and conflicts developing within it. The child psychiatrist works primarily with the pediatricians and the nurses but also with other specialized people of this community. Pediatricians require a prompt answer to their call, clarity of communication and effectiveness. Child psychiatrists complain among other things that they are often invited a little before the discharge of the child, that their instructions are frequently not followed and that they are not informed about the discharge of the patient so to make adequate planning. At the hospital prejudices may exist about child psychiatry which have to be overcome by the specialist. Meetings between child psychiatrists and pediatricians regarding their common patients are helpful in the development of alliances as well as for the appreciation of the knowledge and the understanding of patients which a child psychiatrist can communicated. Teaching pediatric residents knowledge regarding child development elements of psychopathology and of the function of families helps them to become acquainted with child psychiatry. The same possibility is offered through the daily clinical work of a child psychiatrist. Contact with the nursing staff is necessary in order to improve patient care and staff cooperation. Relationships developed in the context of consultation liaison child psychiatry are frequently modified and under review but can also help to the establishment of respect for the work offered by a child psychiatrist."}, {"Title": "Optimisation of whole-body PET/CT scanning protocols.", "Abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) has become one of the major tools for the in vivo localisation of positron-emitting tracers and now is performed routinely using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to answer important clinical questions including those in cardiology, neurology, psychiatry, and oncology. The latter application contributed largely to the wide acceptance of this imaging modality and its use in clinical diagnosis, staging, restaging, and assessment of tumour response to treatment. Dual-modality PET/CT systems have been operational for almost a decade since their inception. The complementarity between anatomic (CT) and functional or metabolic (PET) information provided in a \"one-stop shop\" has been the driving force of this technology. Although combined anato-metabolic imaging is an obvious choice, the way to perform imaging is still an open issue. The tracers or combinations of tracers to be used, how the imaging should be done, when contrast-enhanced CT should be performed, what are the optimal acquisition and processing protocols, are all unanswered questions. Moreover, each data acquisition-processing combination may need to be independently optimised and validated. This paper briefly reviews the basic principles of dual-modality imaging and addresses some of the practical issues involved in optimising PET/CT scanning protocols in a clinical environment."}, {"Title": "Pesticide poisoning in nonfatal, deliberate self-harm: A public health issue.", "Abstract": "Nonfatal, deliberate self-harm (DSH), particularly with pesticides, is a major public health problem in many developing countries of the world. Agriculture is the primary occupation of most people living in the Sundarban region in West Bengal, India. Pesticides are extensively used in agriculture and these agents are most frequently used in DSH.\nThis study sought to identify the nature of methods and agents used in nonfatal DSH attempts in the Sundarban area under South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal.\nDetailed demographic and clinical data on DSH cases of 13 Block Primary Health Centres (BPHCs') admission registers were analysed. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted with the Panchayat Samithy of each block to elicit their perception about the problem of pesticide-related DSH or suicide in the region.\nFive thousand, one hundred and seventy-eight (1,887 male and 3,291 female) subjects were admitted in the BPHCs during the study period from 1999 to 2001. Organophosphorous pesticide poisoning was found to be the most common method (85.1%) in DSH.

Four diagnostic groups consisting of 12058 psychiatric patients who had been diagnosed and treated in the department of psychiatry of this institute from 1999-2004 were included in this evaluation. Bed occupancy rate (BOR), average length of stay (ALOS) of inpatients and seasonal index were determined. Information about weather variables (mean daily temperature, mean rainfall) was collected from the meterological department of Chandigarh.\nPsychiatric services were utilized by 31.1% of patients with mood disorders in the summer and by 34.23% of patients with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders in the autumn.

The results of two studies are presented.\nThe first study surveyed 40 patients involuntarily admitted to the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the University Hospital of T\u00fcbingen, Germany, according to the commitment law. The interviews were carried out within the first days of admission. The second study carried out a retrospective follow-up of 47 court-committed patients; the mean period between commitment and follow-up was 29 months.\nThe majority of patients evaluated the involuntary treatment as not justified--both in direct context and in a long distance to it.

Only one study could be identified that investigates the attitudes of patients. Most people, be they general public or mental health professionals, are in favour of involuntary admission. Cultural, professional and individual differences could be identified.\nThere is a consensus among different societal groups that people with mental illness might be involuntarily admitted.

Kraepelin and Freud were two very different yet very similar men. The comparison between their biographies shows many parallels in their lives and personalities. They were, in their time, the two most influential individuals in psychiatry. They wrote and thought about similar topics in the field yet came to quite different conclusions.

Recent studies have suggested the involvement of the dopaminergic system in addictions and impulse control disorders and associations of dopamine receptor genes (DRD1, DRD2, and DRD4) and PG have been reported. In the present study, 140 sib-pairs discordant for the diagnosis of PG (70 males and 70 females on each group) were recruited through the Gambling Outpatient Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry, University of Sao Paulo and were assessed by trained psychiatrists. A family-based association design was chosen to prevent population stratification. All subjects were genotyped for dopamine receptor genes (DRD1 -800 T/C, DRD2 TaqIA RFLP, DRD3 Ser9Gly, DRD4 48bp exon III VNTR, DRD5 (CA) repeat) and the dopamine transporter gene (SCL6A3 40 bp VNTR).

Already back then the idea that human perception, emotions, thinking and behavior have a material basis was not new. It is conditioned and limited by the structure and workings of the brain. This applies to sane and sick brains alike. In this debate criminality was made a topic of biology by interpreting it as a symptom of genetic \"degeneration\". In regard to brain damage in humans with socially deviant behavior, psychiatry claimed responsibility for a large proportion of criminals. This article lays out some important positions of psychiatry and jurisprudence in this debate on the foundations of legal responsibility and their impact up to now. The debate leads to the conclusion that human behavior cannot be described adequately in physical terms of cause and effect. The psychological approach to describe reasons, motives and intentions is substantially more appropriate. This method is also accepted by criminal law."}, {"Title": "The non-problem of free will in forensic psychiatry and psychology.", "Abstract": "This article demonstrates that there is no free will problem in forensic psychiatry by showing that free will or its lack is not a criterion for any legal doctrine and it is not an underlying general foundation for legal responsibility doctrines and practices. There is a genuine metaphysical free will problem, but the article explains why it is not relevant to forensic practice. Forensic practitioners are urged to avoid all usage of free will in their forensic thinking and work product because it is irrelevant and spawns confusion."}, {"Title": "Benzodiazepine prescribing : lessons from interprofessional dialogue.", "Abstract": "The prescribing of benzodiazepines in the general practice setting raises many issues for general practitioners.

This dialogue was an informal opportunity to debate current practice and learn from the perspective of others.\nWhile a small group discussion has limitations in addressing all the issues pertaining to quality prescribing of benzodiazepines, it does provide a forum for useful debate and has the potential to enhance our effectiveness in the quality use of medicines, in the area of benzodiazepine prescribing."}, {"Title": "Intervention strategies in children with cochlear implants having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder of childhood which not only affects child's education, development and peer functioning but is also associated with significant morbidity in areas of social and academic success. ADHD may hamper the language acquisition in hearing impaired children. When such children are scheduled for the auditory verbal therapy following cochlear implantation, the outcome is limited due to reduced attention span. We have presented two cases who had undergone cochlear implantation and showed the signs of ADHD. As there was little progress in listening skills and speech and language acquisition following 3 months of therapy, both children were referred to Psychiatry Department and were diagnosed as having ADHD. Following little improvement with behavior modification techniques, they were put on medication. Significant improvement was noticed with reduction in hyperactivity and increased attention span after the administration of the drugs."}, {"Title": "The place of culture in forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Members of a multicultural society must all be subject to the same equitable system of justice. However, culture exerts profound influences on human behavior, and cultural considerations have a place in determinations of capacity and in appropriate sentencing. Cultural psychiatry can contribute to forensic psychiatry by helping to contextualize individuals' actions and experiences. This contextualizing can be done through cultural consultations that employ interpreters and culture brokers to identify the role of culture in individuals' psychopathology. Clarifying how cultural background has affected individuals' capacity to form a criminal intent or control their behavior may allow a better determination of level of culpability and guide appropriate sentencing. However, framing behavior as culturally influenced may also stereotype and stigmatize specific groups. To avoid this, culture must be understood in terms of power relationships between minority groups and the dominant society. Cultural factors are not only relevant to the experience of specific groups but pervade the entire judicial system shaping the process of moral and legal reasoning."}, {"Title": "Hindsight bias among psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "It is crucial to minimize bias when offering forensic opinions; however, to our knowledge there are few, if any, existing data examining whether psychiatrists are susceptible to one source of such bias, hindsight bias. In the current study, 235 general and forensic psychiatrists reviewed hypothetical cases in which patients with suicidal or homicidal ideation presented for psychiatric care. We informed half of the participants that a suicide or homicide had occurred shortly after the patients were released from care (hindsight group) but withheld outcome information from the other participants (control group). Participants estimated the likelihood that suicide or violence would occur at the time of the patient's release and whether the standard of care had been met in each case. Responses were compared between groups for suggestions of hindsight bias. Results indicate that hindsight bias plays a role in assessments of risk, but not of negligence, and that psychiatrists who are American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law (AAPL) members may be less prone to respond with hindsight bias than are others."}, {"Title": "Commentary: restorability of incompetence to stand trial--implications beyond predictive equations.", "Abstract": "Since the United States Supreme Court ruling in Sell v.

Forensic psychiatrists are writers, by choice and by necessity. The key concepts to effective writing in forensic psychiatry are \"process\" and a \"workman-like approach.\" The process of writing is not a dash to the finish line, but is more akin to a leisurely, enjoyable walk. A workman-like approach to writing ensures that the author's writing is a process, not an event.

Research shows that special populations such as refugees, recent immigrants, and persons from ethnic minorities with cultural and language barriers are among the hardest to serve and one of the most underserved groups of mental health patients. Focusing on examples of the Clinical Directors' three main task domains, this paper discusses the unique role of the Clinical Director in developing an ACT team that specifically serves ethno-racial minority patients. A program evaluation process to validate the effectiveness of the team illustrates the administrative role; a strategy to incorporate the culturally sensitive and competent \"illness narrative\" model in all clinical encounters of the team illustrates the direct service role; and clinical programming and research addressing the unique family psychoeducation and other needs of this special client population illustrates the clinical collaboration role. The role of the Clinical Director on this special ACT team fits well with that of a program level Clinical Director as described in literature. The role demands specialized clinical, administrative, advocacy, and evaluative skills emphasized in programs such as the Columbia University Public Psychiatry Fellowship."}, {"Title": "European guidelines for training in consultation-liaison psychiatry and psychosomatics: report of the EACLPP Workgroup on Training in Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatics.", "Abstract": "The European Association of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatics (EACLPP) has organized a workgroup to establish consensus on the contents and organization of training in consultation-liaison (C-L) for psychiatric and psychosomatic residents.\nInitially, a survey among experts has been conducted to assess the status quo of training in C-L in different European countries. In several consensus meetings, the workgroup discussed aims, core contents, and organizational issues of standards of training in C-L. Twenty C-L specialists in 14 European countries participated in a Delphi procedure answering a detailed consensus checklist, which included different topics under discussion.\nConsensus on the following issues has been obtained: (1) all residents in psychiatry or psychosomatics should be exposed to C-L work as part of their clinical experience; (2) a minimum of 6 months of full-time (or equivalent part-time) rotation to a C-L department should take place on the second part of residency; (3) advanced training should last for at least 12 months; (4) supervision of trainees should be clearly defined and organized; and (5) trainees should acquire knowledge and skills on the following: (a) assessment and management of psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders or situations (e.g., suicide/self-harm, somatization, chronic pain and psychiatric disorders, and abnormal illness behavior in somatically ill patients); (b) crisis intervention and psychotherapy methods appropriate for medically ill patients; (c) psychopharmacology in physically ill patients; (d) communication with severely ill patients and dying patients, as well as with medical staff; (e) promotion of coordination of care for complex patients across several disciplines; and (f) organization of C-L service in relation to general hospital and/or primary care.

More recently distinct concepts of self have also been suggested in neuroscience more specifically in neuroimaging.\nThe aim here is to apply these findings to abnormalities of the self in depression and to develop neuropsychiatric hypothesis.\nPatients with depression suffer from an increased self-focus, attribution of negative emotions to the self, and increased cognitive processing of the own self. We assume that in major depressive disorder (MDD), the abnormal self-focus may be related to altered neural activity in the ventral cortical midline structures (CMS), the one-sided attribution of negative emotions to the self with neural activity in the amygdala and the ventral striatum/N. accumbens, and the abnormal cognitive processing of one's self with reciprocal modulation between ventral CMS and lateral prefrontal cortical regions.\nIt is concluded that the transdisciplinary investigation of the self between neuroscience, psychiatry and philosophy yields novel insights into the psychopathology and pathophysiology of the self in depression as well as into the neurophilosophical concept of the self in general."}, {"Title": "[Interest of psychiatric guidelines in managing agitation in intensive care].", "Abstract": "This paper discusses the importance of psychiatric guidelines and the position of the psychiatrist in the management of agitation in the intensive care unit. The use of psychiatric validated scales to assess agitation seems to ameliorate the quality of care in psychiatry, but also in intensive care. Psychiatric experts' recommendations for managing agitation are given, which is useful to create an open discussion with the intensivists. The use of sedative medication to protect the patient, staff and to prevent an escalation of violence remains a personal choice for each practitioner, depending on individual patient needs and context.

As the first of a two-volume body of work that bears the subtitle, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, Anti-Oedipus is, to say the least, an unconventional work that should be understood, in part, as a product of its time--created as it was among the political and revolutionary fervour engendered by the events of 'May 1968'. However, this paper will suggest that Anti-Oedipus--as a critique of psychoanalysis and the Oedipus complex, as well as being a study of the relationship between capitalism and schizophrenia--should also be understood in a less 'time-bound' fashion. In particular, the paper will examine Deleuze and Guattari's formulation of a concept of 'desire' and its employment in relation to subjectivity, time, capitalism, representation, and the radical 'therapeutic' practice that they refer to as 'schizoanalysis'. Moreover, nearly 40 years after the events of May 1968 and against possible doubts concerning the contemporary relevance of psychoanalysis, it will be suggested that psychoanalysis and the Oedipus complex are to be understood as symptomatic of a wider 'malaise' that can be discerned within psychiatry, psychotherapy, and contemporary capitalist society itself, and that it is this that forms the broader target of the book's critique. Accordingly, by providing an accessible and critical introduction to Anti-Oedipus, the paper also hopes to stimulate further discussion and research regarding both the critique and the contribution that the work can make to contemporary psychiatry, psychotherapy, and mental health nursing generally."}, {"Title": "Schizophrenia and comorbid self reported cannabis abuse: impact on course, functioning and services use.", "Abstract": "To examine the impact of cannabis abuse on the short term outcome in terms of relapses, use of services, compliance and functioning in patients with schizophrenia.\nA case control study was conducted in the Department of Psychiatry PGMI Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar from January 2004 to October 2004.

Dopamine research has had a greater impact on the development of biological psychiatry and psychopharmacology than work on any other neurotransmitter. Neuropsychological views of the role of dopamine in the CNS have evolved from that of a simple reward signal to a more complex situation in which dopamine encodes the importance or 'salience' of events in the external world. Hypofunctional dopamine states underlie Parkinson's disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and there is increasing evidence for dopamine hyperactivity in schizophrenia. Some of the medicines that are most widely used in psychiatry, such as L-DOPA, methylphenidate and neuroleptic drugs, act on dopaminergic mechanisms."}, {"Title": "Rumination-focused cognitive behaviour therapy for residual depression: a case series.", "Abstract": "The treatment of chronic and recurrent depression is a priority for the development of new interventions. The maintenance of residual symptoms following acute treatment for depression is a risk factor for both chronic depression and further relapse/recurrence. This open case series provides the first data on a cognitive-behavioural treatment for residual depression that explicitly targets depressive rumination. Rumination has been identified as a key factor in the onset and maintenance of depression, which is found to remain elevated following remission from depression.

Treatment specifically focused on switching patients from less helpful to more helpful styles of thinking through the use of functional analysis, experiential/imagery exercises and behavioural experiments. Treatment produced significant improvements in depressive symptoms, rumination and co-morbid disorders: 71% responded (50% reduction on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) and 50% achieved full remission. Treating depressive rumination appears to yield generalised improvement in depression and co-morbidity.

Pathogenic interaction between religion and psychological disorders is discussed in plurifactorial perspective. Religious views can be distorted by psychic disorders and adapted to the disorders.

A larger number of different diagnoses were expected to be applied after the introduction of the 10th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Reflecting the time trend, we particularly expected an increase in the number of neuropsychiatric diagnoses. From the Danish Psychiatric Central Register data were drawn on clinical discharge diagnoses. All patients aged 0-15 years examined at psychiatric hospitals from 1995-2002 were included; 22,469 children and adolescents with a first contact were registered. The most frequent discharge diagnoses were pervasive development disorders (PDD; 11.9%), adjustment disorders (10.6%), conduct disorder (9.5%), emotional and anxiety disorders (7.6%), hyperkinetic disorders (7.3%), and specific developmental disorders (7.3%). We found a significant increase in the number of neuropsychiatric and affective diagnoses and a significant decrease in the number of adjustment, conduct and anxiety diagnoses during the study period. Of the 22,469 diagnoses, 45% were only partly specified according to ICD-10. Thirty-four per cent had diagnoses unspecified on the four-character level (Fxx.9) and 11% had Z-diagnoses.

Though the project never materialized, the idea was characteristic of the very beginning of the Soviet era, when the wildest experiments in the human sciences seemed possible. The author of the project, the psychiatrist Grigorii Vladimirovich Segalin (1878-1960), followed in the steps of another prominent psychiatrist, the architect of the Soviet mental health care system, Lev Markovich Rozenshtein (1884-1934). Rozenshtein, a proponent of social medicine, introduced a new system of psychiatric help that, by contrast with the prerevolutionary one, was preventive and based on outpatient units - neuropsychiatric dispensaries. In a similar way, Segalin planned dispensaries for geniuses, where these otherwise \"socially ill adapted\" people would receive professional help and care.

The swing of the pendulum in the direction of biological psychiatry has led to a marginalization of psychotherapy within the discipline of psychiatry as a whole. However, psychotherapy continues to be a basic science of psychiatry with application in all clinical settings. It must be regarded as a biological treatment that works by changing the brain and is therefore just as important as pharmacotherapy in terms of overall treatment planning. The combined treatment of medication and psychotherapy has become the most common mode of psychiatric treatment planning in current practice. Both the two-treater model and the single-treater model have a set of advantages and disadvantages that are explicated. Further research is needed to identify clinical situations in which psychotherapy is essential, whether alone or in combination with medication. Moreover, as greater insights are gained into the brain mechanisms responsible for therapeutic changes, more specifically targeted psychotherapies can be developed."}, {"Title": "[The impact of socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors on the criminal behavior of patients with a psychotic disorder].", "Abstract": "The impact of socioeconomic and demographic factors on the criminal behavior of patients with a psychotic disorder was evaluated.\nThe study included 70 psychotic men hospitalized in the forensic psychiatry unit of the Bakirk\u00f6y State Hospital for Psychiatric and Neurological Diseases for compulsory treatment who were compared to 70 psychotic disorder cases with no criminal history hospitalized in the acute wards in the same hospital. Socioeconomic and sociodemographic data were collected and statistical evaluations were made.\nThe vast majority of all the patients (90.7%) in both groups were diagnosed with schizophrenia. The forensic group was significantly less educated than the control group (7.99+/-3.81 years vs. 9.37+/-3.62 years, P<0.05). More than 50% of the cases in both groups were never married ; when considering divorced and widowed patients together with these unmarried patients, the percentage rose to 83%. Fewer forensic cases lived in urban areas than did control cases (50% vs. 84.3%). Logistic regression analysis highlighted a relationship between unemployment and the lack of social insurance to the criminal behaviour of the forensic group. Of those in the forensic group, 48.6% had no social insurance, whereas only 15.7% of the control group had none.\nThe data suggested that unemployment and the lack of social insurance are 2 independent variables that may contribute to the probability that patients with a psychotic disorder will engage in criminal behavior."}, {"Title": "Application of electroencephalography to the study of cognitive and brain functions in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded from the human scalp is widely used to study cognitive and brain functions in schizophrenia. Current research efforts are primarily devoted to the assessment of event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related oscillations (EROs), extracted from the ongoing EEG, in patients with schizophrenia and in clinically unaffected individuals who, due to their family history and current mental status, are at high risk for developing schizophrenia. In this article, we discuss the potential usefulness of ERPs and EROs as genetic vulnerability markers, as pathophysiological markers, and as markers of possible ongoing progressive cognitive and cortical deterioration in schizophrenia. Our main purpose is to illustrate that these neurophysiological measures can offer valuable quantitative biological markers of basic pathophysiological mechanisms and cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia, yet they may not be specific to current psychiatry's diagnosis and classification. These biological markers can provide unique information on the nature and extent of cognitive and brain dysfunction in schizophrenia. Moreover, they can be utilized to gain deeper theoretical insights into illness etiology and pathophysiology and may lead to improvements in early detection and more effective and targeted treatment of schizophrenia.

Efficacy has been well demonstrated in conditions such as headache, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, fibromyalgia, hypertension, low back pain, depression, cancer symptoms, and postmyocardial infarction. However, an apparent disconnect (ie, translational block) prevents more widespread adoption of such therapies into practice. Biofeedback, relaxation therapy, hypnosis, guided imagery, cognitive behavioral therapy, and psychoeducational approaches are the domain of MBM we examined in assessing physician attitudes, beliefs, and practices.\nUsing a Web-based survey, we obtained responses from 74 faculty and resident physicians in the Department of Family Medicine and the Department of Psychiatry. Our response rate was 69%. We conducted descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis, and multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model. Various statistics were chosen depending on the nature of analyzed variables. Synoptic tables are presented.\nComparing these cohorts, we found little difference between physicians in the two specialties, but substantial reports that barriers to the use of MBM were largely based on lack of training, inadequate expertise, and insufficient clinic time. Lack of expertise and insufficient clinic time were higher among family physicians than among psychiatrists. There was a high interest in both groups in learning relaxation techniques and meditation and lower interest in biofeedback and hypnosis. Female physicians were significantly more likely to use MBM, both with patients and for their own self-care, and were less likely to be concerned that recommending these therapies would make patients feel that their symptoms were being discounted. Female physicians also had significantly higher beliefs about the benefits of MBM on health disorders in several of the conditions examined, with a consistent though nonsignificant trend in others."}, {"Title": "Spasmodic dysphonia in an adolescent patient with an autoimmune neurologic disorder.", "Abstract": "Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) has been primarily described in the neurology and psychiatry literature.

The growing utility of surgical and device-related treatments for psychiatric conditions may represent a sea change in the field of psychiatry comparable to that seen in other clinical disciplines. For example, for many years the overwhelming majority of cardiac conditions were treated with medications and behavioral interventions. With the advent of cardiac surgical procedures such as ablation and cardiac bypass surgery and the use of devices such as cardiac stents and pacemakers, the ability to treat cardiac disease has improved dramatically. The hope is that the use of neurotherapeutic interventions will lead to a similar improvement in the treatment of psychiatric illness. The future of neurotherpeutic interventions in psychiatry may include the use of neuroimaging technology to predict with patients may respond to which procedures or to guide the placement of DBS electrodes on an individual basis. DBS electrodes also could be placed in multiple brain regions. Clinical trials of cortical stimulation using surgically implanted electrodes on the brain surface are underway. These cortical-surface electrodes could provide cortical stimulation comparable to that induced by rTMS at the same location, obviating the need for visits to a physician for rTMS treatments and providing cortical stimulation of a greater magnitude and for an extended duration. Also, one can foresee surgical interventions in which neurotransmitter release is potentiated either by stimulating appropriate nuclei in the brain or by releasing neurotransmitters or neurotransmitter precursors into target brain regions using cannulae or an implanted device. Neurotrophic factors also could be introduced into target brain regions using analogous techniques. Although the future of neurotherapeutic interventions in psychiatry is hard to predict, it is clear that these treatments will have a growing role in the field."}, {"Title": "Development and introduction of a comprehensive tobacco control policy in a Canadian regional health authority.", "Abstract": "Tobacco control policies in health care settings are necessary to protect patients, employees, physicians, visitors, and volunteers from the dangers of secondhand smoke.

CH recently determined that it needed to revise its tobacco control policy because its facilities had different directives regarding tobacco use, some of which did not reflect the best current knowledge about the health risks associated with exposure to secondhand smoke.\nThe new smoke-free policy needed to be developed and executed within a narrow time frame, which required careful planning as well as the support of patients and CH staff members. An essential part of the new policy was the prevention of nicotine withdrawal among people required to undergo involuntary tobacco abstinence. The plan also included an integrated screening, intervention, and referral process designed to optimize health benefits for patients and staff members who smoked, as well as for those who did not.\nCH decided to close all smoking rooms (including those in psychiatry, palliative care, geriatrics, eating disorder, and tuberculosis units), to ban smoking in outdoor areas, to stop all sales of tobacco products in CH facilities, to require smoke-free environments during home visitations, and to reject funding from the tobacco industry.\nBy implementing a consistent ban on indoor and outdoor smoking, CH is contributing to a comprehensive tobacco control policy that is arguably a regional health authority's most profound opportunity for health promotion."}, {"Title": "Depressive disorders and immunity: 20 years of progress and discovery.", "Abstract": "Since the inception of Brain, Behavior and Immunity twenty years ago, many exciting developments have occurred regarding the relationship between depression and the immune system. These developments have increasingly put the field of psychoneuroimmunology into a clinical context with important translational implications. Initial studies focused on the impact of depression on relatively narrowly defined immunologic endpoints, which ultimately found their relevance in studies examining the effect of depression on immunologically-based diseases including infectious illnesses, autoimmune disorders, and cancer as well as more recently cardiovascular disease. Mechanistic studies have also greatly contributed to an understanding of those facets of depression, which might mediate these effects. More recently, the reciprocal influences of the immune system on the brain and behavior including depression have taken center stage. Increasing data now indicate that activated inflammatory processes can influence multiple aspects of CNS function including neurotransmitter metabolism, neuroendocrine function, and information processing leading to behavioral changes in humans that bespeak depression. These latter developments have intrigued scientists investigating the pathophysiology of depression and warrant consideration as some of the most exciting new developments in psychiatry in the past 20 years. What the future holds is a world of promise as multiple translational targets derived from the cytokine model of depression work their way into the clinical arena as drug targets for further development.

The objective of this study was to assess the extent to which such guidelines are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder.\nIn November 2005, self-administered questionnaires were sent to 7000 psychiatrists who treat bipolar disorder in their clinical practice. An additional mailing of these questionnaires was done in January 2006 to a different group of 7000 psychiatrists who also treat bipolar disorder in their clinical practice. The first 312 completed surveys were analyzed. Eight questions relevant to clinical usage of, and attitudes toward, existing guidelines were asked.\nAmong the 312 respondents, 64.1% reported making routine use of treatment guidelines when making clinical decisions, including 19.6% who used the American Psychiatric Association treatment guidelines and 33.0% who used all published guidelines. Of those who did not use bipolar guidelines, the most frequently cited reason given by respondents (20.1%) was that such guidelines do not address particular features of their clinical populations. Among the different types of practice, private individual practice gave this answer most frequently (27.5%).\nThese results suggest that, despite considerable efforts to develop and disseminate evidence-based guidelines, they are not widely implemented and substantial opportunities exist to educate clinicians about their value and relevance. Limitations of the study include a low response rate and possible selection bias. Nonetheless, this project was conceived of as a pilot study and these limitations do not negate the findings, but suggest other avenues for investigation."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Introduced this year on the Swiss market, duloxetine (Cymbalta) is a new antidepressant which inhibits the reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin.

Patients scored satisfaction on the same OPTION behaviours. Eight clinicians were involved, as were 61 patients.\nThe clinicians scored on average 43 points at overall 'shared decision making', on a scale of 0-100. Clinicians performed well in asking if patients had any questions. They scored low on meta-items about the decision making process: checking the preferred approach of the patient to receive information, or checking the preferred level of involvement in decision making. Satisfaction scores of a group of 29 patients showed no concern about these low scores.\nThe clinicians in this study did not ask meta questions about participation in decision making. An explanation given was that they intuitively 'feel' if a patient wants to be involved or not. Patients did not express great concern about this. More experiments with clinicians openly checking desired participation levels of patients are needed, in order to learn more about possibilities in meta communication, and possible biases of clinicians.\nOur starting point was that clinicians need to become experts in all roles of their profession, as communicator as well as medical expert. Providing mirror information by assessing decision making behaviours will help to improve performance. Clinicians should be able to perform these SDM behaviours, even if patients are not asking for participation. Claims that clinicians do empathically feel if patients are able to involve in decision making, should be checked by scientific experiments."}, {"Title": "Resilience theory and the diagnostic and statistical manual: incompatible bed fellows?", "Abstract": "As in any scientific undertaking, theoretical orientation and the classification schemas underlying those theories are important to test hypotheses about optimal conditions for fostering positive growth and adaptation.

We argue that the DSM was a necessary first step toward a general theory of classification because diagnoses in psychiatry needed to be operationalized but that the DSM's inability to evolve as a classification system and to incorporate developmentally sensitive interactional and transactional factors make the DSM categorical approach inadequate for developmental science.

Practical issues (e.g., simply forgetting or a change in routine) were the most frequently identified reasons for nonadherence. Patients were more likely to report nonadherence if they experienced a sexual side effect, had lower self-efficacy, were female, and had not completed post-secondary education.

Error commission, detection, and recovery are an integral part of cognitive work, even at the expert level. In collaborative workspaces, the perception of potential error is directly observable: workers discuss and respond to perceived violations of accepted practice norms. As perceived violations are captured and corrected preemptively, they do not fit Reason's widely accepted definition of error as \"failure to achieve an intended outcome.\" However, perceived violations suggest the aversion of potential error, and consequently have implications for error prevention. This research aims to identify and describe perceived violations of the boundaries of accepted procedure in a psychiatric emergency department (PED), and how they are resolved in practice.\nClinical discourse from fourteen PED patient rounds was audio-recorded. Excerpts from recordings suggesting perceived violations or incidents of miscommunication were extracted and analyzed using qualitative coding methods. The results are interpreted in relation to prior research on vulnerabilities to error in the PED.\nThirty incidents of perceived violations or miscommunication are identified and analyzed. Of these, only one medication error was formally reported. Other incidents would not have been detected by a retrospective analysis.\nThe analysis of perceived violations expands the data available for error analysis beyond occasional reported adverse events. These data are prospective: responses are captured in real time. This analysis supports a set of recommendations to improve the quality of care in the PED and other critical care contexts."}, {"Title": "Self-manslaughter and the forensic classification of self-inflicted death.", "Abstract": "By emphasising the intentions underlying suicidal behaviour, suicidal death is distinguished from accidental death in standard philosophical accounts on the nature of suicide. A crucial third class of self-produced deaths, deaths in which agents act neither intentionally nor accidentally to produce their own deaths, is left out by such accounts. Based on findings from psychiatry, many life-threatening behaviours, if and when they lead to the agent's death, are suggested to be neither intentional nor accidental, with many apparently suicidal behaviours being of this sort, especially the so-called \"cries for help\".

Black patients tend, for example, to be prescribed higher doses of antipsychotics than whites. Few studies have controlled for other factors which may influence prescribing practice and confound results. This study sought to determine whether or not ethnicity was associated with antipsychotic polypharmacy, high dosage and antipsychotic costs before and after adjustment for potential confounding. We approached inpatients on acute general psychiatry wards at the Maudsley, Bethlem and Lambeth hospitals in south east London. Prescription details were noted. Subjects were interviewed and social and clinical details were recorded. In all, data on 23 potential confounders were collected.A total of 210 patients were approached of whom 153 agreed to take part. Of the 23 potential confounders, only use of English as a first language and duration of illness differed significantly between blacks and whites. Categorical findings were adjusted for these factors and other potential confounders such as age and gender. Total antipsychotic daily dose was 82.2% of licensed maximum in blacks, and 77.2% in whites (p=0.48). Antipsychotic polypharmacy was seen in 23.2% of blacks and 16.9% of whites (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.11; 95% CI, 0.45-2.75). High dose (> 100% of maximum dose) antipsychotic regimens were prescribed to 15.9% of blacks and 16.9% of whites (adjusted OR, 0.71: 95% CI, 0.27-1.90). Mean monthly cost of treatment was significantly higher in blacks than whites (182.79 vs 143.08 British pound; p=0.02; adjusted OR (> 150 British pound/month), 2.45: 95% CI, 1.19-5.08).

However, there has been no formal study of the pharmacokinetic implications of PRN prescribing. The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of PRN drug prescription and administration, and to assess the potential for interactions involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 between drugs prescribed and administered to inpatients on psychiatry wards.A cross-sectional survey of prescriptions on general adult and functional elderly psychiatric wards in one city was carried out. Data were recorded from prescription charts of 323 inpatients (236 on general adult and 87 on functional elderly wards). Of 2089 prescriptions, 997 (48%) of prescriptions were on a PRN basis (most commonly benzodiazepines and other hypnotic agents, antipsychotics, analgesics and anticholinergic agents), but only 143 (14%) of these had been administered in the previous 24 hours. One fifth of patients were prescribed drug combinations interacting with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 of potential clinical importance which included one or more drugs prescribed on a PRN basis.PRN prescribing is common among inpatients in psychiatry, and may lead to cytochrome P450 mediated interactions. Prescribers should be aware of the potential for unpredictability in plasma concentrations, side effects and efficacy which PRN prescribing may cause through these interactions, particularly in old age psychiatry and in treatment of acute psychosis."}, {"Title": "Review of the american psychiatric publishing textbook of personality disorders.", "Abstract": "Reviews the book, The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Personality Disorders edited by John M.

Given the importance of genetic and environmental risk factors, aging processes, neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease processes, and medical comorbidity, the integration of basic and clinical neuroscience research approaches is critical for the understanding of the variability in illness course, as well as the development of prevention and intervention strategies that are more effective. These considerations were the impetus for a workshop, sponsored by the Geriatrics Research Branch in the Division of Adult Translational Research and Treatment Development of the National Institute of Mental Health that was held on September 7-8, 2005. The primary goal of the workshop was to bring together investigators in geriatric psychiatry research with researchers in specific topic areas outside of geriatric mental health to identify priority areas to advance translational research in geriatric depression. As described in this report, the workshop focused on a discussion of the development and application of integrative approaches combining genetics and neuroimaging methods to understand such complex issues as treatment response variability, the role of medical comorbidity in depression, and the potential overlap between depression and dementia. Future directions for integrative research were identified. Understanding the nature of geriatric depression requires the application of translational research and interdisciplinary research approaches. Geriatric depression could serve as a model for translational research integrating basic and clinical neuroscience approaches that would have implications for the study of other neuropsychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "An introduction to causal modeling in clinical trials.", "Abstract": "We review and compare two causal modeling approaches that correspond to two major and distinct classes of inference - efficacy and intervention-based inference - in the context of randomized trials with subject noncompliance.\nWe review the definitions of efficacy and intervention-based effects in the clinical trials literature and relate these to two separate and distinct causal modeling approaches: the structural mean modeling (SMM) approach and the principal stratification, instrumental variable approach.\nThe SMM-based efficacy approach focuses on the effect of actually receiving treatment. In contrast, the principal stratification method addresses the effect of treatment assignment within partially unobserved latent subgroups defined by compliance behavior. While these approaches differ in terms of philosophy, model definitions, and estimation, they estimate the same causal effect under certain assumptions, but estimate very different causal effects when those assumptions are relaxed. We illustrate these results using a randomized psychiatry trial where the focus is physician compliance to the designated protocol and the other examines patient compliance to the designated protocol, both from the same trial.\nThe validity of the models under the instrumental variable, SMM and principal stratification approaches depends on modeling assumptions, some of which may not be verifiable from the observed data and potentially less realistic than the no-confounding assumption made by non-causal approaches.\nThis comparison in terms of efficacy versus intervention-based effects in causal modeling parallels the explanatory versus pragmatic approaches in clinical trials research; therefore researchers should weigh carefully when choosing causal modeling methodology based on whether efficacy or intervention-based effects are of interest."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry during the Nazi era: ethical lessons for the modern professional.", "Abstract": "For the first time in history, psychiatrists during the Nazi era sought to systematically exterminate their patients. However, little has been published from this dark period analyzing what may be learned for clinical and research psychiatry. At each stage in the murderous process lay a series of unethical and heinous practices, with many psychiatrists demonstrating a profound commitment to the atrocities, playing central, pivotal roles critical to the success of Nazi policy. Several misconceptions led to this misconduct, including allowing philosophical constructs to define clinical practice, focusing exclusively on preventative medicine, allowing political pressures to influence practice, blurring the roles of clinicians and researchers, and falsely believing that good science and good ethics always co-exist. Psychiatry during this period provides a most horrifying example of how science may be perverted by external forces. It thus becomes crucial to include the Nazi era psychiatry experience in ethics training as an example of proper practice gone awry."}, {"Title": "Visual loss and visual hallucinations in patients with age-related macular degeneration (Charles Bonnet syndrome).", "Abstract": "The condition in which visual hallucinations (VHs) are solely associated with a visual impairment is termed Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS). The study was undertaken to investigate whether the extent of visual acuity (VA) loss and central visual field loss predisposes a patient with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to develop a CBS VH and, in addition, whether the progression in loss is mirrored in the complexity of the VHs reported. VH phenomenology and CBS prevalence were also examined.\nSixty-six patients (age range, 63-96 years, mean +/- SD 81.2 +/- 7.1 years) with bilateral AMD were questioned as to whether they had experienced any hallucinatory episodes exclusive to vision. The four-point primary inclusion criterion ensured that all patients had bilateral AMD, a bilateral central scotoma, best monocular VA poorer than or equal to 0.6 logMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) and intact cognition (using the Mini Mental State Examination for the Blind and the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status). The patients who did not report VH were classified into the non-VH group, with the remainder in the VH group. An extended Institute of Psychiatry Structural Interview characterized the phenomenology of the VH. A secondary inclusion criterion subdivided the VH group into the apparent CBS group, in which personal medical history may have contributed to VH generation, and the manifest CBS group, where VHs were solely as a result of the visual loss.\nFifty-three patients met the primary inclusion criterion: 32 were classified into the non-VH group and 21 into the VH group. The VH group were slightly younger (median difference, 4 years, P = 0.03) and appeared to have a lower VA (median difference, 0.20 logMAR, P = 0.08) and a more extensive visual field loss (P = 0.06) than did the non-VH group. However, when these variables were evaluated simultaneously by logistic regression, only age emerged as a statistically significant predictor of VH (odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8-0.99, P = 0.03). The prevalence of apparent CBS and manifest CBS in the AMD population was found to be 25% and 15%, respectively. With no clinical and phenomenological differences between the two CBS groups, the secondary inclusion criterion was withdrawn, the VH group was renamed the CBS group, and a prevalence of 40% was recalculated. Of the 82 visual phenomena experienced by the CBS group, 21 were classified as simple VHs and 39 as complex VHs, with the remainder classified as either entopic phenomena or visual inference. Patients who experienced both simple and complex VHs appeared to have a greater visual field loss (P = 0.06) compared with those patients who reported either solely simple or solely complex VHs.\nThe extent of visual loss did not appear to be a predictor for the likelihood of a patient with AMD experiencing a CBS VH, nor was the progression of loss reflected in the complexity of the VHs reported."}, {"Title": "[Diagnostic classification of mental disorders in infants and toddlers age 0 to 5].", "Abstract": "The Article is working on developmental psychopathology, diagnosis, and treatment of behavioral problems in infants and toddlers age 0 to 5.

We report a case of a probable anticholinergic drug-induced delirium in an elderly patient. An 80-year-old man with Alzheimer's dementia presented with wandering, depressed mood with crying, somatic worries, anedonism and suicide recurrent ideas. A first external psychiatric assessment led to the diagnosis of melancholic depression and therapy with haloperidol 2mg/day, orphenadrine 100mg daily, amitriptyline 40 mg/day, lorazepam 2mg/day was started. Two weeks later patient suddenly developed delirium, characterized by nocturnal agitation, severe insomnia, daytime sedation, confusion, hallucinations and persecutory delusions. These symptoms progressively worsened, with the consequent caregiver's stress. A geriatric consultation excluded the main causes of delirium, therefore both Operative Units of Pharmacovigilance and Psychiatry were activated, for a clinical pharmacological and psychiatric assessment. Haloperidol, amitriptyline and orphenadrine were promptly dismissed. The patient began a treatment with quetiapine 25mg/day for two days, then twice a day, and infusion of saline 1000 ml/day for two days; psychiatric symptoms gradually diminished and therapy with galantamine was begun. We postulate that this clinical report is suggestive for an anticholinergic drug- induced delirium since the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between delirium and drug therapy.

From February to June 2005, we approached 49 residents through random sampling stratified by programme and gender. The semi-structured instrument elicited descriptions of well-being in residency and factors related to its promotion or reduction.

Residents described well-being as a balance among multiple domains, including professional development, relationships, and physical and mental health. They viewed residency as a time for temporary imbalance, during which they invested in professional development at the expense of other domains. Some residents described feeling a 'loss of self'. Residents revealed strategies for coping with stressors and endorsed ways in which training programmes helped to enhance their well-being.\nResident well-being was closely connected to professional development and required varying degrees of self-sacrifice with a re-balancing of personal priorities.

Forty fully recovered patients who had attempted to commit suicide and 40 healthy volunteers wrote and signed a short letter or story not related to the parasuicide or their mental health status. The evaluators classified the 80 letters as 'suicide' or 'no suicide' in an intention-to-treat analysis. Letters expressing sadness were subsequently excluded for a per-protocol analysis. Correct diagnosis of suicide and of healthy controls was made in, respectively, 32 of 40 and 33 of 40 letters by the graphologists and in 27 of 40 and 34 of 40 letters by the internists.

After a brief look at the ideas and expectations Sullivan brought to the screening system, I discuss a major problem of the screening: the mismatch between the medical concept of disease prevention and the realities of the mass screening as a public policy. As a way to highlight this mismatch, I focus on Sullivan's failure to protect homosexual men from medical and social stigmatization by screening them out of the armed forces. Despite his liberal approach to the issue of homosexuality before the war, which he had created in his clinical practice, Sullivan was unable to persuade the military and the public of gay men's right to serve the nation. The examination of how his sympathetic view of homosexuality became circumscribed reveals not only the gap between clinical insights and public policy, but also how tentative views of homosexuality in public debate among liberal psychiatrists during the decade preceding the war contributed to the failure to make non-homophobic policy in the 1940s. This article shows that the relative conservatism in the politics of sexuality among liberal psychiatrists, as well as the intransigent conservatism as seen in homophobic tradition of the Army, contributed to the discriminatory screening criteria."}, {"Title": "Special online consulting for patients with eating disorders and their relatives: analysis of user characteristics and E-mail content.", "Abstract": "In the treatment of chronic diseases, programs that use the internet as a medium are becoming more and more important as a complement to classical intervention techniques.

The enhanced authority of nonpsychiatrist clinicians that emerges from successful contests of representations illustrates a possible future for psychiatry as a multidisciplinary medical specialty."}, {"Title": "The validity of the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (VRAG) in predicting criminal recidivism.", "Abstract": "The VRAG is an actuarial risk assessment instrument, developed in Canada as an aid to estimating the probability of reoffending by mentally ill offenders.\nTo test the predictive validity of the VRAG with a German sample.\nThe predictive validity of the VRAG was tested on a sample of 136 people charged with a criminal offence and under evaluation for criminal responsibility in the forensic psychiatry department at the University of Munich in 1994-95. The predicted outcome was tested by means of ROC analysis for correlation with the observed rate of recidivism between discharge after the 1994-95 assessment and the census date of 31 March 2003. Recidivism rate was calculated from the official records of the National Conviction Registry.\nJust over 38% of the sample had reoffended by 2003. Their mean time-at-risk was 58 months (SD 3.391; range 0-115 months). The VRAG yielded a high predictive accuracy in the ROC analysis with an AUC of 0.703. For a constant time-at-risk < = 7 years, the predicted probability and observed rates of recidivism correlated significantly with Pearson's r = 0.941.\nThe validity of the VRAG was replicated with a German sample.

The molecular substrates and pathways of CRH/CRH-R1-dependent signaling mechanisms underlying the behavioral phenotype as well as the consequences of lifelong glucocorticoid deficit remain largely obscure. To dissect involved neuronal circuitries, we performed comparative expression profiling of brains of CRH-R1 mutant and wild-type mice using our custom made MPIP (Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry) 17k cDNA microarray. Microarray analysis yielded 107 genes showing altered expression levels when comparing CRH-R1 knockout mice with wild-type littermates. A significant proportion of differentially expressed genes was related to control of HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axes reflecting not only the disturbance of the HPA axis in CRH-R1 mutant mice but also the interplay of both neuroendocrine systems. The spatial analysis of regulated genes revealed a prevalence for genes expressed in the cerebral microvasculature. This phenotype was confirmed by the successful cross-validation of regulated genes in CRH overexpressing mice. Analysis of the cerebral vasculature of CRH-R1 mutant and CRH overexpressing mice revealed alterations of functional rather than structural properties. A direct role of the CRH/CRH-R1 system was supported by demonstrating Crhr1 expression in the adult murine cerebral vasculature. In conclusion, these data suggest a novel, previously unknown role of the CRH/CRH-R1 system in modulating neurovascular gene expression and function."}, {"Title": "Insulin counter-regulatory factors, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein during olanzapine administration: effects of the antidiabetic metformin.", "Abstract": "In this study, the Authors assessed some insulin counter-regulatory factors, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein after olanzapine administration, and the effect of metformin on these variables, 37 patients with chronic schizophrenia were given olanzapine (10 mg/day for 14 weeks). Nineteen patients received metformin (850-2550 mg/day) and 18 received placebo in a randomized, double-blind protocol. The following variables were quantified before and after olanzapine: cortisol, leptin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, glucagon, growth hormone, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein. Results were correlated with the changes in body weight and the insulin resistance index. We have reported elsewhere that metformin did not prevent olanzapine-induced weight gain, and the insulin resistance index significantly decreased after metformin and placebo; Baptista T, et al. Can J Psychiatry 2006; 51: 192-196. Cortisol, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and fibrinogen levels significantly decreased in both groups. Glucagon significantly increased after metformin (P=0.03). Leptin tended to increase after placebo (P=0.1) and displayed a small nonsignificant reduction after metformin. The C-reactive protein did not change significantly in any group. Contrarily to most published studies, olanzapine was associated with decreased insulin resistance. Decrements in cortisol, fibrinogen and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels point to an improvement in the metabolic profile. The trend for leptin to increase after placebo, but not after metformin in spite of similar weight gain suggests a beneficial effect of this antidiabetic agent."}, {"Title": "Mechanisms of exposure therapy: how neuroscience can improve psychological treatments for anxiety disorders.", "Abstract": "Exposure therapy for anxiety disorders has been one of success stories of clinical psychology and psychiatry. Nevertheless, a significant minority of patients fail to benefit from extant treatments.

The purpose of this article is to provide a review of theories of exposure therapy, including recent developments in emotional processing theory, and to discuss insights from neuroscience that promise to improve psychological treatments for reducing pathological fears."}, {"Title": "Association of the HTR2C gene and antipsychotic induced weight gain: a meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "The 5-HT2C receptor has been hypothesized to represent an important modulator in feeding behaviour. Evidence was based on the observation that knock-out mice for the 5-HT2C receptor gene (HTR2C) develop obesity and that many atypical antipsychotics with potent 5-HT2C antagonism may induce weight gain in susceptible individuals. Pharmacogenetic studies focusing mainly on the -759C/T promoter polymorphism (rs3813929) of the X-linked HTR2C gene revealed controversial results. We investigated the association of the HTR2C gene and weight gain using meta-analytical techniques, combining all published data while restricting our analysis to studies investigating the 759C/T. We also investigated whether ancestry (Caucasian vs. Asian) and clinical factors moderated any association. We found evidence for a slight association of -759C/T with weight gain and significance between studies for heterogeneity. Our meta-analysis provides support for the association of HTR2C in weight gain but indicates that firmly establishing the role of pharmacogenetics in clinical psychiatry requires much larger sample sizes that have been hitherto reported."}, {"Title": "A case of late-onset dependence on cocaine and crack.", "Abstract": "To raise awareness among the professional clinical and research community of the risk of cocaine misuse among elderly patients.\nCase report of a male patient, aged 72 years, who presented to a community substance misuse service with cocaine use disorder (hydrochloride and base form).\nThe development of the disorder was marked by high levels of cocaine (and later crack cocaine use), repeated periods of abstinence followed by relapse in the past 4 years, with severe consequences to the patient and his family.

Results of a national survey.", "Abstract": "This study examined interventions for substance use disorders within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) psychiatric and primary care settings.\nNational random samples of 83 VA psychiatry program directors and 102 primary care practitioners were surveyed by telephone. The survey assessed screening practices to detect substance use disorders, protocols for treating patients with substance use disorders, and available treatments for substance use disorders.\nRespondents reported extensive contact with patients with substance use problems. However, a majority reported being ill equipped to treat substance use disorders themselves; they usually referred such patients to specialty substance use disorder treatment programs.\nOffering fewer specialty substance use disorder services within the VA may be problematic: providers can refer patients to specialty programs only if such programs exist. Caring for veterans with substance use disorders may require increasing the capacity of and establishing new specialty programs or expanding the ability of psychiatric programs and primary care practitioners to provide such care."}, {"Title": "Paroxetine: current status in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with antidepressant and anxiolytic properties. It is commercially available in both an immediate-release (paroxetine) and a controlled-release formulation (paroxetine CR). The latter product was developed to improve gastrointestinal tolerability. Paroxetine is the most potent inhibitor of the reuptake of serotonin among the available SSRIs. It has approved indications for the treatment of major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and social phobia in adults. Paroxetine CR is approved for the treatment of major depression, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder in adults. While the overall efficacy of paroxetine appears to be comparable with other SSRIs in the treatment of major depression, it is approved for use in a wider variety of anxiety disorders than any other antidepressant. Long-term data suggest that paroxetine is effective in preventing relapse or recurrence of depression for up to 1 year. Limited data show that paroxetine maintains a therapeutic response over 1 year in obsessive-compulsive disorder and up to 6 months in panic disorder. The side-effect profile of paroxetine is largely similar to that of the other SSRIs, although paroxetine tends to be more sedating and constipating in some patients, perhaps due to its anticholinergic activity. The potential for discontinuation syndrome and weight gain appears to be slightly higher with paroxetine than with other SSRIs. This review focuses on the immediate release and controlled-release formulations of paroxetine. It summarizes the efficacy and tolerability data for both formulations, with a particular emphasis on paroxetine CR which was introduced in 2002. It also discusses emerging evidence in other clinical areas and recent data that have led to modifications in the safety profile of paroxetine."}, {"Title": "Characteristics of medical school graduates who underwent problem-based learning.", "Abstract": "In this study, we compared the choice of medical specialty and subspecialty interest among problem-based-learning (PBL) graduates and non-PBL graduates.\nQuestionnaires were mailed to a total of 1398 female doctors who graduated from Tokyo Women's Medical University (TWMU) between 1989 and 2003.

Current specialty of the graduates were compared between the PBL+ and PBL-, and also compared with the general Japanese female doctors (Control 1 and 2) of similar age groups. Respondents were analysed in terms of their interests in subspecialty medical care or general medical practise, which includes comprehensive medical care, primary care and basic medicine. Internal medicine doctors working in the university hospitals were compared with those working outside the university hospitals. Internal medicine doctors were also compared with specialists in ophthalmology, otolaryngology, dermatology and psychiatry.

This study proposes to improve the reliability of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale in depressive disorders by the use of a semi-standardized interview, a new response format, and a Delphi procedure.\nThirty patients hospitalised for a major depressive episode were filmed at T1 (first week in hospital) and at T2 (2 weeks later) during a 5' specific interview. The Hamilton Depressive Rating Scale and the Symptom Check List were also rated. Eleven psychiatrists rated these videos using either the usual CGI response format or an improved response format, with or without a Delphi procedure.\nThe new response format slightly improved (but not significantly) the interrater agreement, the Delphi procedure did not. The best results were obtained when ratings by 4 independent raters were averaged. In this situation, intraclass correlation coefficients were about 0.9.\nThe Clinical Global Impression is a useful approach in psychiatry since it apprehends patients in their entirety.

For the principal nosologists of psychiatry, melancholic depression has always meant something quite different from non-melancholic depression. Exceptions to this include Aubrey Lewis and Karl Leonhard. Yet the balance of opinion among the chief theorists overwhelmingly favors the existence of two quite different illnesses.\nThe concept of 'major depression' popularized in DSM-III in 1980 is a historical anomaly. It mixes together psychopathologic entities that previous generations of experienced clinicians and thoughtful nosologists had been at pains to keep separate. Recently, there has been a tendency to return to the concept of two depressions: melancholic and non-melancholic illness. 'Major depression' is coming into increasing disfavor. In the next edition of DSM (DSM-V), major depression should be abolished; melancholic mood disorder (MMD) and non-melancholic mood disorder (NMMD) should become two of the principle entities in the mood disorder section."}, {"Title": "Neuroendocrine mechanisms of stress and social interaction: implications for mental disorders.", "Abstract": "The purpose of the present review is to consider further evidence for the role of neuroendocrine mechanisms in mental disorders by focusing on recent trends and advances in the field of psychoneuroendocrinology.\nRecent studies confirm the importance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis for the development and course of mental disorders. Notably, the neuropeptide oxytocin has been shown to reduce the responsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to social stress and to improve social approach behavior. A better understanding of the neuroendocrine mechanisms of action underlying normal behavior has recently been translated to studies investigating novel therapeutic approaches using hormone administration.\nNeuroendocrine systems relevant to behavior clearly demonstrate their impact for the field of psychiatry.

A particularly interesting finding is that apart from environmental and psychological factors, drug response may be influenced by several biological factors as a result of genetic determinants leading to interindividual variability. Several mutations in genes coding for enzymes of the drug metabolizing system, as well as for neurotransmitter receptors or degrading enzymes and monoamine transport proteins, have been identified and investigated in psychiatry. But, despite the fact that some genetic polymorphisms of enzymes (mainly cytochrome P450 2D6) are well known, the application of pharmacogenetics as a therapeutic tool for improving patient care is rare. This review has three parts. In the first an overview is given of CYP450 characteristics and the genetic polymorphisms of interest to psychiatry.

Papers published in indexed journals and graduate dissertations were retrieved, using \"eating disorders,\" \"anorexia nervosa,\" \"bulimia nervosa,\" \"body image,\" \"binge eating,\" \"restrained eating,\" \"weight and shape concern,\" and \"dieting\" as keywords. These were combined with the Boolean operator \"AND\" with \"Mexico\" and \"Latin America.\" Findings are presented for epidemiology, the validity of assessment instruments, comorbidity, and risk factors. A national representative survey found a prevalence of 1.8% for bulimia nervosa, and no cases of anorexia nervosa. However, the lack of studies with confirmatory clinical interview and other national or regional representative samples makes it difficult to reach conclusions about the actual prevalence. A number of instruments for the detection of eating disorders and disordered eating have been validated for the Mexican population. The comorbidity of eating disorders in Mexico includes drug and alcohol abuse, obesity, and borderline personality disorder. Risk factors found included body weight and cultural pressure to be thin. Future lines of research should include epidemiological studies with representative samples and diagnosis confirmation, longitudinal studies, and the exploration of protective and risk factors specific to this population.

Abstracts and posters on long-acting risperidone presented at key psychiatry congresses and available in the public domain during this time period were also reviewed.\nThe unique pharmacokinetic profile of long-acting risperidone is derived from the encapsulation of risperidone in a glycolide/lactide matrix in the form of microspheres such that after a single intramuscular injection, significant plasma levels of the drug are achieved after week 3. Steady state, after repeated administration at 2-week intervals, is achieved after 3 injection cycles. Short- and long-term studies have demonstrated that long-acting risperidone (25, 37.5, or 50 mg) is both efficacious and well tolerated in a wide variety of patients with schizophrenia and related psychoses. Most patients can be switched from other oral and long-acting antipsychotic agents without compromising efficacy and safety. Long-acting risperidone may also reduce overall healthcare costs by decreasing rates of relapse and hospitalization.\nThe assured delivery of an atypical antipsychotic medication with long-acting risperidone has important implications for patient compliance, maintenance of stability, consistency of treatment, and improving patient outcomes including the achievement of remission."}, {"Title": "Academic health center management of chronic diseases through knowledge networks: Project ECHO.", "Abstract": "The authors describe an innovative academic health center (AHC)-led program of health care delivery and clinical education for the management of complex, common, and chronic diseases in underserved areas, using hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a model. The program, based at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, represents a paradigm shift in thinking and funding for the threefold mission of AHCs, moving from traditional fee-for-service models to public health funding of knowledge networks. This program, Project Extension for Community Health care Outcomes (ECHO), involves a partnership of academic medicine, public health offices, corrections departments, and rural community clinics dedicated to providing best practices and protocol-driven health care in rural areas. Telemedicine and Internet connections enable specialists in the program to comanage patients with complex diseases, using case-based knowledge networks and learning loops. Project ECHO partners (nurse practitioners, primary care physicians, physician assistants, and pharmacists) present HCV-positive patients during weekly two-hour telemedicine clinics using a standardized, case-based format that includes discussion of history, physical examination, test results, treatment complications, and psychiatric, medical, and substance abuse issues. In these case-based learning clinics, partners rapidly gain deep domain expertise in HCV as they collaborate with university specialists in hepatology, infectious disease, psychiatry, and substance abuse in comanaging their patients. Systematic monitoring of treatment outcomes is an integral aspect of the project. The authors believe this methodology will be generalizable to other complex and chronic conditions in a wide variety of underserved areas to improve disease outcomes, and it offers an opportunity for AHCs to enhance and expand their traditional mission of teaching, patient care, and research."}, {"Title": "[Vitamin C measurements in vulnerable populations: 4 cases of scurvy].", "Abstract": "Hypovitaminose C, at the origin of the scurvy, did not disappear.

Although more benzodiazepines are prescribed in Japan than in any other country, no hospital-based report has documented this phenomenon. Therefore, this study compared the prescription frequency of benzodiazepines with that of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and other antidepressants in a single Japanese hospital over 1 year.\nThe annual prescription of benzodiazepines was assessed with that of antidepressants using an electronic database of medical records for outpatients at a Japanese tertiary care hospital affiliated with a private university with approximately 600,000 outpatient visits annually.\nGroups of departments were analyzed separately (i.e. internal medicine, surgery, neurology, psychiatry, and others). The ratio of the number of prescriptions of anxiolytic benzodiazepines to that of SSRI and SNRI was calculated among the department groups and used as one of indicators comparing the prescriptions of benzodiazepines with those of antidepressants.\nOf 644,444 hospital prescriptions, 6.1% were for anxiolytic benzodiazepines, and 5.8% were for hypnotic benzodiazepines. Regarding antidepressants, 1.6% of prescriptions were for SSRIs/SNRIs, 0.8% were for tricyclic antidepressants, and 1.5% were for other antidepressants. Of the benzodiazepine prescriptions, 26.8% were written by the internal medicine group. The ratio of the number of prescriptions for anxiolytic benzodiazepines to that for SSRI and SNRI was highest in the department of internal medicine (ratio = 13.0), followed by surgery (7.6), neurology (4.8), and psychiatry (2.5). With the department of psychiatry as the reference, the tendency to prescribe an anxiolytic benzodiazepine rather than an SSRI or SNRI was statistically significant in the remaining four department groups, after controlling for the effects of patient age and sex in a multiple logistic regression analysis.\nBenzodiazepine prescriptions in the Japanese hospital were far more common than prescriptions for antidepressants such as SSRIs and SNRIs, especially in internal medicine.

We assessed whether physicians gravitate to certain practice specialties due to preexisting personality traits. The Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Personality Inventory Revised Test was administered prospectively to 130 first-year students the week before they began medical school. Scores for five traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness) were compared with the selection among nine medical residencies at the conclusion of medical school. Personality scores for medical students selecting psychiatry residencies showed greater degrees of neuroticism (P < 0.01) and openness (P < 0.03). Students electing family practice also deviated from other specialties, showing a lower degree of neuroticism (P < 0.03). Unexpectedly, personality traits in prospective surgical residents did not differ from those of students choosing nonsurgical residencies. Personality profiles present before medical school appear to predict the selection of some residencies and clinical specialties but not others."}, {"Title": "Self-stigma in people with mental illness.", "Abstract": "Persons with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia may internalize mental illness stigma and experience diminished self-esteem and self-efficacy. In this article, we describe a model of self-stigma and examine a hierarchy of mediational processes within the model. Seventy-one individuals with serious mental illness were recruited from a community support program at an outpatient psychiatry department of a community hospital. All participants completed the Self-Stigma of Mental Illness Scale along with measures of group identification (GI), perceived legitimacy (PL), self-esteem, and self-efficacy. Models examining the steps involved in self-stigma process were tested. Specifically, after conducting preliminary bivariate analyses, we examine stereotype agreement as a mediator of GI and PL on stigma self-concurrence (SSC); SSC as a mediator of GI and PL on self-efficacy; and SSC as a mediator of GI and PL on self-esteem. Findings provide partial support for the proposed mediational processes and point to GI, PL, and stereotype agreement as areas to be considered for intervention."}, {"Title": "Lack of experience of intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke does not influence the proportion of patients treated.", "Abstract": "To determine the eligibility of patients with ischaemic stroke admitted to the 2nd Department of Neurology, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Warsaw, Poland, for intravenous thrombolysis; to identify the major exclusions and assess whether organisational changes in the in-hospital stroke pathway and informative campaign in the local community and medical services can increase the number of patients treated; and to establish whether lack of previous experience with thrombolytic treatment or trials is predictive of the low proportion of patients treated.\nA survey of the database of patients with stroke admitted during the first 30 months after the introduction of intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke was conducted to search for all eligible patients. This included patients admitted within 2 h of symptom onset (assuming a 1 h door-to-needle time), age <80 years, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) Score of 5-22, seizures at onset, platelet count >100,000/ml, glycaemia 50-400 mg/dl and international normalised ratio (INR) <1.6. The number of eligible patients was compared with the number actually treated.\n745 patients with acute ischaemic stroke were admitted during the study period. 18.4% were admitted within 2 h of symptom onset, 71% were aged <80 years, 55.4% had an NIHSS score between 5 and 22, 96.1% had INR <1.6, 98.9% had a platelet count >100,000/ml, 99.4% had blood glucose concentrations of 50-400 mg/dl and 97.4% had no seizures at onset. After adjusting for all inclusion criteria, 7.1% of the patients were found to be potentially eligible and 8.7% were actually treated (p = 0.25). Of the 65 treated patients, 63.1% were independent after 3 months, 16.9% died and none had a symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage.\nThe proportion of patients with ischaemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis in a previously inexperienced centre was not lower than in other centres and in countries where this treatment has been provided for a longer period of time. The number of patients treated was higher than that estimated mainly owing to organisational changes introduced in our centre, allowing treatment of those admitted between 2 and 3 h after symptom onset."}, {"Title": "Gender differences in characteristics of Chinese treatment-seeking problem gamblers.", "Abstract": "A total of 952 (841 men and 111 women) Chinese treatment-seeking problem gamblers completed self-report assessment forms.

Female gamblers also started gambling at an older age, had a shorter gambling history, preferred casino and mahjong gambling, and reported more somatic complaints and suicidal thoughts. Male and female gamblers accumulated similar amount of gambling debt and reported an average of 12 gambling-related problems on the Chinese version of the South Oaks Gambling Screen [Lesieur and Blume (Am J Psychiatry 144:1184-1188, 1987)]. Both groups were similarly troubled by their indebtedness, inability to control gambling, and gambling-related interpersonal problems.

This effect can be improved by acquiring better communication skills and information. The second level needs a possibility to change the emotional individual process and the relational context in a continuum between counselling and psychotherapy. To practice this level a complete psychotherapeutic education with some specificity is needed. This can be reached by a dermatologist also being a psychotherapist or by a team consisting of both dermatologist-psychotherapist. 2) The psychodermatological patient is characterized by alexithymia. He/she needs to be understood through the body language he/she presents. This kind of patient is coming from families where the theme of loss seems to dominate the histories and be associated with deep emotional experiences of separation anxiety. These characteristics must be known together with the different psychodermatological disorders and the mind-body interaction to handle these patients. 3) Taking all of this complexity into account, the psychodermatologist or the psychodermatological team should be able to integrate the different points and adapt attitudes to the patient's difficulty during the whole therapeutic process. 4) The evaluation of the problem should be done using psychological tools here described.\nThe European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) together with the European Society for Dermatology and Psychiatry (ESDaP) are able to provide the specific education for dermatologist and psychotherapist.

Prevalence, risk factors, treatment options, and reentry into clinical practice are discussed.\nImpairment of a healthcare professional is the inability or impending inability to practice according to accepted standards as a result of substance use, abuse, or dependency (addiction). The term substance use disorder can be divided into substance abuse and dependence (addiction). Substance abuse results in adverse social and professional consequences. Addiction manifests as physiologic and behavioral symptoms related to a maladaptive pattern of substance use.\nIt is estimated that approximately 10% to 15% of all healthcare professionals will misuse drugs or alcohol at some time during their career. Although the rates of substance abuse and dependence are similar to those of the general population, the prevalence is disturbing because healthcare professionals are the caregivers responsible for the general health and well-being of the general population. Healthcare professionals have higher rates of abuse with benzodiazepines and opiates. Specialties such as anesthesia, emergency medicine, and psychiatry have higher rates of drug abuse, probably related to the high-risk environment associated with these specialties, the baseline personalities of these healthcare providers, and easy access to drugs in these areas. Drugs and alcohol are mostly used for \"recreational\" purposes by medical students. Residents and attending physicians use drugs of abuse for performance enhancement and as self-treatment for various reasons, such as, pain, anxiety, or depression.\nInstitutional, local, and statewide impaired-physician programs are now available for the active treatment and rehabilitation of impaired healthcare professionals. Many of these programs are also designed to assist the clinician with reentry into clinical practice. Rarely is punitive action taken when the healthcare provider undergoes successful treatment and ongoing follow-up management. Overall recovery rates for impaired healthcare professionals seem to be higher compared with other groups, particularly with intensive inpatient management and subsequent follow-up care."}, {"Title": "Achieving competency in electroconvulsive therapy: a model curriculum.", "Abstract": "This article illustrates a model electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) curriculum with specific parameters of both practice-based learning and medical knowledge.\nThe authors review the recommendations of the APA Task Force on ECT as they relate to training in ECT in psychiatry residency programs, and discuss diverse educational experiences across American psychiatry residencies.\nThe authors present objective methods for assessment of factual knowledge germane to ECT practice, including an objective structured clinical examination.\nThe ECT curriculum allows residents to become familiar with the theory and practice of ECT.

Consenting participants were asked to provide demographic information and then complete the accompanying questionnaire after reading two vignettes. One of the vignettes described a depressed patient and the other a psychotic patient. The subjects were asked to estimate the GAF scores for the patients in both vignettes. Then the subjects were given the GAF scoring guide to review and were asked to re-assess their initial GAF scores for the patients in the vignettes.\nMedical students assigned much higher GAF scores for the patient in the vignette with less severe symptoms than the psychiatry residents and staff psychiatrists. The GAF scores of all three groups for the patient in the vignette with more severe symptoms were comparable.\nThe ability of medical students to assign proper GAF scores needs to be studied further. Our study suggests that current 1-month rotations in psychiatry, without specific training on assigning GAF scores, may not provide medical students with enough information to assess GAF scores accurately.

Structured diagnostic interviews were used to interview patients and their parents.\nThe mean age of onset for obsessive-compulsive disorders was 11.3 years. In males the onset was slightly earlier than among females, but this difference was not significantly significant. Compulsions mostly referred to washing and cleaning, checking, repeating, ordering, and counting. Most frequently, obsessions included thought about contamination, catastrophes, sexuality, and aggression. According to parental reports, the rate of comorbidity was high (lifetime diagnosis: 69%, current diagnosis: 53%), with anxiety, depressive, hyperkinetic, conduct, and eating disorders being the most frequent co-morbid conditions. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms were more intense in those patients who had a greater number of lifetime diagnoses of other psychiatric disorders. Comparing the rates found when structured interviews were carried out according to the study protocol to those for clinicians, clinicians were found to have diagnosed mixed obsessional thoughts and acts (presenting obsessional thoughts, as well as compulsive acts) less frequently.\nThe results of this investigation are well in line with those of international studies on obsessive-compulsive disorders. The rates of disorders found were dependent on the diagnostic methods used.

The subjective quality of life of people with schizophrenia has been shown to be lower than in the general population and appropriate patient-assessed health outcome measures are necessary to capture the distress and disability experienced by people living with a serious mental illness. Although psychiatry has been slow to become involved in quality of life measurement, the use of quality of life instruments has now been recognized as a means of evaluating the outcome of care interventions, in terms of symptoms and functioning. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of two widely used instruments: The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and The Lancashire Quality of Life Profile (LQoLP) in terms of reliability and validity in measuring the quality of life of people with schizophrenia. The LQoLP appeared to be best suited for evaluation of care programmes, whereas the SF-36 was more appropriate for medical trials, comparisons between patient groups, and assessment of the direct consequences of treatment on health and function. Subjective quality of life should, however, be considered to be distinct from clinical status and quality of life assessment should include the broadest range of indicators, to reflect the holistic ethos of mental health nursing."}, {"Title": "[An imbalance between drive and guidance.

We also consulted recent manuals on schizophrenia, evolutionary psychiatry and neuroanatomy.\nThe analysis showed that during the phylogenesis and ontogenesis of the brain two mechanisms, which are primarily motor-control mechanisms, are applied to the intentional level of functioning; one of these initiates and delivers power to intentions (the drive mechanism), whereas the other steers and guides intentions (the guidance mechanism). As a result of the repeated application of these two mechanisms an imbalance to the detriment of the drive mechanism in the end manifests itself as schizophrenia. The model clarifies the clinical and epidemiological findings and the course of the illness.\nThe model provides a more comprehensive explanation for existing clinical and epidemiological data than do current alternatives.

This trial exposed a perverse system of the criminal use of medicine in the fields of public health and human research. These practices, in which racial hygiene constituted one of the fundamental principles and euthanasia programmes were the most obvious consequence, violated the majority of known bioethical principles. Psychiatry played a central role in these programmes, and the mentally ill were the principal victims. The aim of the present work is to review, from the historical perspective, the antecedents of the shameful euthanasia programmes for the mentally ill, the procedures involved in their implementation and the use of mentally ill people as research material. The Nuremberg Code, a direct consequence of the Doctors' Trial, is considered to be the first international code of ethics for research with human beings, and represented an attempt to prevent any repeat of the tragedy that occurred under Nazism. Nevertheless, the last 60 years have seen continued government-endorsed psychiatric abuse and illegitimate use of psychoactive drugs in countries such as the Soviet Union or China, and even in some with a long democratic tradition, such as the United States. Even today, the improper use of psychiatry on behalf of governments is seen to be occurring in numerous parts of the globe: religious repression in China, enforced hospitalization in Russia, administration of psychoactive drugs in immigrant detention centres in Australia, and the application of the death penalty by lethal injection and psychiatric participation in coercive interrogation at military prisons, in relation to the USA.

Assessments were made of the psychometric qualities of feasibility and reliability using a representative sample of patients with mental and behavioral disorders.\nAn analysis of the feasibility of the HoNOS-D showed a range of missing values between 1.3 and 4.5% for 11 of the 12 items. An item analysis showed that three items of the HoNOS-D are particularly positively skewed. In most instances, the individual items of the rating scale exhibited only slight correlations to each other. With regard to retest reliability, satisfactory intraclass correlations between 0.80 and 0.91 were seen for 9 of the 12 items.\nThe authors of the original version of the HoNOS [Wing et al.:Br J Psychiatry 1998;172:11-18] primarily emphasized the feasibility of the instrument and the independence of the individual items and dimensions. The analysis of the missing values showed satisfactory results for feasibility. The intercorrelation matrix of the individual items also exhibited only few correlations >0.30. The retest reliability also proves to be satisfactory for the majority of the items. The narrow distribution of some of the items must be critically discussed in comparison to analyses of results in other countries (e.g. Great Britain) and other settings (e.g. inpatient psychiatric hospitals or outpatient psychotherapy)."}, {"Title": "Existence and pluralism: the rediscovery of Karl Jaspers.", "Abstract": "Karl Jaspers has been recognized in psychiatry mostly for his influence on phenomenology and on certain aspects of psychopathology, such as our understanding of delusions. In this paper, I will highlight the need to rediscover Jaspers' work in terms of other important ideas that he can contribute to psychiatry, in particular the concepts of limit situations, transcendence and pluralism. Limit situations refer to the fact that human life is characterized by existential situations, or crises, which become opportunities for authentic existence. Transcendence refers to the notion that freedom is an important aspect of human existence and cannot be explained by purely scientific understanding or encompassed by any purely rationalistic system of thought. Pluralism is perhaps Jaspers' most original perspective, which has still failed to be adequately appreciated by the psychiatric profession. The idea here is that science means understanding the methods by which we obtain knowledge, along with the presuppositions and limits of those methods. Contemporary psychiatry has only a limited appreciation of Jaspers' work. In this paper, I attempt to describe these important concepts that can help us understand what we do in psychiatry, what we should be doing and why."}, {"Title": "Law & psychiatry: Telecourt: the use of videoconferencing for involuntary commitment hearings in academic health centers.", "Abstract": "The use of videoconferencing for psychiatric involuntary commitment hearings is not a recent development.

However, studies regarding the prevalence of these symptoms are few. The characteristics of migraineurs with cranial autonomic symptoms and the association of cranial autonomic symptoms with laterality of headache have never been studied in a clinic population. Seventy-eight consecutive subjects with migraine were recruited from the Headache Clinic of the Department of Psychiatry after exclusion of subjects with secondary headache. Their demographic data and detailed history of headache were noted and leading questions were asked regarding cranial autonomic symptoms. chi(2) test and Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables, whereas an independent sample t-test was applied on numerical data. Spearman's correlation was used for correlational analysis of categorical variables. Female subjects (78.2%) outnumbered males and the average duration of illness in the whole sample was 3.81 years. Migraine without aura (53.8%) was the commonest diagnosis, followed by migraine with aura (24.4%). Cranial autonomic symptoms were present in 73.1% of subjects and, commonly, they were ipsilateral to headache. Moreover, strictly unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms were reported by only 32% of patients. The anatomical side of headache did not affect the presence of autonomic symptoms. Those with or without autonomic symptoms did not differ with respect to gender, diagnosis, laterality of headache or associated symptoms except phonophobia, which was more common in subjects with autonomic symptoms (P = 0.05). Those with autonomic symptoms had longer duration of illness (P = 0.03) and longer headache episodes (P = 0.04). In addition, sleep was ineffective in relieving their headache (P = 0.02). Cranial autonomic symptoms are frequent in migraineurs and are common in subjects with long duration of illness and longer headache episodes. Clinical evidence in the present study suggests that subjects with cranial autonomic symptoms have a hyperactive efferent arm of trigeminal autonomic reflex. The connections of trigeminal nucleus with the locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe nucleus may account for the observed phenotypic differences between the two groups. Further research, however, is required to elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms of cranial autonomic symptoms in migraine."}, {"Title": "The relationship of antipsychotic medication class and adherence with treatment outcomes and costs for Florida Medicaid beneficiaries with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "While some studies show a significant advantage in adherence rates with use of atypical versus typical antipsychotic medication, others show no advantage or mixed results (Jones et al.

Alcohol decreases spontaneous growth hormone (GH) secretion, but the mechanism is unclear. The aim of this study was to test whether administration of alcohol (study 1) or a N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (study 2) attenuates the GH response to pharmacological dopaminergic stimulation.\nThe 2-session repeated measures design was conducted at the endocrine laboratory at the Department of Psychiatry at the Free University Berlin. Twenty healthy Caucasian males aged 35+/-10 years without a history of alcohol use disorders were tested using the Apomorphine (APO) challenge test. In study 1, we injected APO (0.01 mg/kg s.c.) 1 hour after oral administration of 1 g/kg ethanol and placebo, respectively. In study 2, the APO challenge was conducted after 0.3 mg/kg dextromethorphan (DXM) and placebo. The main outcome measures were the peak serum GH concentration and area under the time/concentration curve up to 120 minutes after APO. The effects of ethanol and DXM were tested using the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.\nCompared with placebo, alcohol significantly decreased the APO-induced GH release (mean and SEM peak GH concentration 19.9+/-3.2 vs 6.2+/-1.9 ng/mL, p=0.002). Dextromethorphan did not change APO-induced GH response (22.5+/-5.4 vs 21.0+/-5.8 ng/mL, p=0.105).\nA single intermediate alcohol dose markedly reduces GH response to dopaminergic stimulation. Although alcohol is thought to stimulate dopaminergic function in certain pathways, but not necessarily in the hypothalamus, our results are in line with the alcohol effect on baseline GH secretion. Growth hormone suppression appears not to be mediated by ethanol's NMDA-antagonistic properties."}, {"Title": "[40 years beta-adrenoceptor blockers in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Beta-adrenoceptor blockers belong to the most successful drug classes of medicine. Mainly they are used in internal medicine. 40 years ago beta-adrenoceptor blockers have occasionally been used in psychiatry for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Over the past four decades, the effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockers in the treatment of schizophrenic and manic psychoses, withdrawal syndromes and aggressive behaviour with temper outbursts has been investigated. Beta-adrenoceptor blockers are also used in the treatment of side-effects of psychopharmacological agents like neuroleptic or antidepressant-induced tachycardias, lithium-induced tremor, antipsychotic-induced akathisia or tardive dyskinesia as well. Since the mid-nineties it has been attempted to improve the efficacy of antidepressant agents by means of the 5-HT-(1a)-receptorantagonist pindolol. Presumedly memory consolidation of traumatic events can be enhanced by adrenergic activation. Therefore some open clinical trials investigated the effects of propranolol, a lipid soluble drug, which crosses the blood-brain barrier easily, to reduce the manifestation of PTSD. The present review presents the results of the literature with respect to the indications for beta-blockers in psychiatry. Considering evidence-based-medicine criteria beta-blockers are indicated to treat lithium-induced tremor, antipsychotic-induced akathisia and to reduce aggressive behavior of patients with brain-injuries."}, {"Title": "The current state of mental health care in Italy: problems, perspectives, and lessons to learn.", "Abstract": "After legislative changes in 1978, Italian psychiatry underwent a thorough overhaul, with the gradual closure of all Mental Hospitals. A nation-wide network of Departments of Mental Health now deliver outpatient and inpatient care, but also run semi-residential and residential facilities (the latter with 2.9 beds per 10,000 inhabitants). Hospital care is delivered through small psychiatric units (with no more than 15 beds). There are also many private inpatient facilities operating in Italy, and the number of private inpatient beds per 10,000 inhabitants exceeds the number of public beds; overall there are 1.7 acute beds per 10,000 inhabitants - one of Europe's currently lowest numbers. There is marked quanti- and qualitative variation in the provision of out- and inpatient care throughout the country, and service utilization patterns are similarly uneven. Studies examining quality of life report a fairly high degree of patient satisfaction, whereas patients' families frequently bear a heavy burden. In conclusion, the Italian reform law led to the establishment of a broad network of facilities to meet diverse care needs. Further efforts are required to improve quality of care and to develop a more effectively integrated system. Greater attention must be paid to topics such as quality of care and outcomes, public and private sector balance, and the coordination of various resources and agencies."}, {"Title": "Altered pain processing in veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder.", "Abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and debilitating anxiety disorder.

Some of the available articles that have mentioned the relationship of psychotic symptoms and topiramate usage are discussed. Objective. The present paper aims to discuss a case of psychotic exacerbation purported to occur after TPM administration and to review specifically the literature on TPM's potential for inducing psychotic symptoms. The patient presented here is thought to be an undiagnosed schizophrenia patient until his admission to our clinic (Department of Psychiatry, Gazi University Medical School) with TPM-exacerbated psychotic symptoms.

The effects of various endocrine-hormonal dysfunctions in psychiatry are well known and have been targeted by scientific study for quite some time. During the past few years, psychiatric research has shifted its interest to the cellular level. Steroids that originate in the periphery (e.g. ovaries), as well as those synthesized by the central nervous system (neurosteroids), have neuroplastic effects and interfere with almost all known neurotransmitter systems. Therefore steroid de-regulation that is caused by the PCOS is related to psychiatric symptomatology on both a pathophysiological and a clinical level. In medical psychiatric practice, PCOS is related to many disorders: bipolar disorder and its treatment, epilepsy, depression, cognitive disorders, sleep disorders, eating disorders, and somatoform disorders. On a psychological level, women suffering from PCOS may display depressive symptoms, anxiety, body image dissatisfaction, diminished sexual interest, and compromised quality of life. Therefore, we believe that it is useful for the clinical psychiatrist to keep in mind the psychiatric and the psychological aspects of PCOS, and their impact on patient diagnosis, course and treatment."}, {"Title": "What psychiatry means to me.", "Abstract": "Moving in early career from public health physician to psychiatrist gives me a public health view of psychiatry and an interest in pursuing the goals of widening access to community-based services for people with mental disorders and promoting mental health in communities.

At most places it has been welcomed as the next best thing to technology itself. Much of the intellectual talent from academic institutions is getting absorbed in lucrative positions in industry. Applied research finds willing collaborators in venture capital funded industry, so a symbiotic growth is ensured for both.There are significant costs involved too. As academia interacts with industry, major areas of conflict of interest especially applicable to biomedical research have arisen. They are related to disputes over patents and royalty, hostile encounters between academia and industry, as also between public and private enterprise, legal tangles, research misconduct of various types, antagonistic press and patient-advocate lobbies and a general atmosphere in which commercial interest get precedence over patient welfare.Pharma image stinks because of a number of errors of omission and commission. A recent example is suppression of negative findings about Bayer's Trasylol (Aprotinin) and the marketing maneuvers of Eli Lilly's Xigris (rhAPC). Whenever there is a conflict between patient vulnerability and profit motives, pharma often tends to tilt towards the latter. Moreover there are documents that bring to light how companies frequently cross the line between patient welfare and profit seeking behaviour.A voluntary moratorium over pharma spending to pamper drug prescribers is necessary. A code of conduct adopted recently by OPPI in India to limit pharma company expenses over junkets and trinkets is a welcome step.Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are considered important as they guide the diagnostic/therapeutic regimen of a large number of medical professionals and hospitals and provide recommendations on drugs, their dosages and criteria for selection. Along with clinical trials, they are another area of growing influence by the pharmaceutical industry. For example, in a relatively recent survey of 2002, it was found that about 60% of 192 authors of clinical practice guidelines reported they had financial connections with the companies whose drugs were under consideration. There is a strong case for making CPGs based not just on effectivity but cost effectivity. The various ramifications of this need to be spelt out. Work of bodies like the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) Collaboration and Guidelines Advisory Committee (GAC) are also worth a close look.Even the actions of Foundations that work for disease amelioration have come under scrutiny. The process of setting up 'Best Practices' Guidelines for interactions between the pharmaceutical industry and clinicians has already begun and can have important consequences for patient care. Similarly, Good Publication Practice (GPP) for pharmaceutical companies have also been set up aimed at improving the behaviour of drug companies while reporting drug trialsThe rapidly increasing trend toward influence and control by industry has become a concern for many. It is of such importance that the Association of American Medical Colleges has issued two relatively new documents - one, in 2001, on how to deal with individual conflicts of interest; and the other, in 2002, on how to deal with institutional conflicts of interest in the conduct of clinical research. Academic Medical Centers (AMCs), as also medical education and research institutions at other places, have to adopt means that minimize their conflicts of interest.Both medical associations and research journal editors are getting concerned with individual and institutional conflicts of interest in the conduct of clinical research and documents are now available which address these issues. The 2001 ICMJE revision calls for full disclosure of the sponsor's role in research, as well as assurance that the investigators are independent of the sponsor, are fully accountable for the design and conduct of the trial, have independent access to all trial data and control all editorial and publication decisions. However the findings of a 2002 study suggest that academic institutions routinely participate in clinical research that does not adhere to ICMJE standards of accountability, access to data and control of publication.There is an inevitable slant to produce not necessarily useful but marketable products which ensure the profitability of industry and research grants outflow to academia. Industry supports new, not traditional, therapies, irrespective of what is effective. Whatever traditional therapy is supported is most probably because the company concerned has a product with a big stake there, which has remained a 'gold standard' or which that player thinks has still some 'juice' left.Industry sponsorship is mainly for potential medications, not for trying to determine whether there may be non-pharmacological interventions that may be equally good, if not better. In the paradigm shift towards biological psychiatry, the role of industry sponsorship is not overt but probably more pervasive than many have realised, or the right thinking may consider good, for the health of the branch in the long run.An issue of major concern is protection of the interests of research subjects. Patients agree to become research subjects not only for personal medical benefit but, as an extension, to benefit the rest of the patient population and also advance medical research.We all accept that industry profits have to be made, and investment in research and development by the pharma industry is massive. However, we must also accept there is a fundamental difference between marketing strategies for other entities and those for drugs.The ultimate barometer is patient welfare and no drug that compromises it can stand the test of time. So, how does it make even commercial sense in the long term to market substandard products? The greatest mistake long-term players in industry may make is try to adopt the shady techniques of the upstart new entrant. Secrecy of marketing/sales tactics, of the process of manufacture, of other strategies and plans of business expansion, of strategies to tackle competition are fine business tactics. But it is critical that secrecy as a tactic not extend to reporting of research findings, especially those contrary to one's product.Pharma has no option but to make a quality product, do comprehensive adverse reaction profiles, and market it only if it passes both tests.Why does pharma adopt questionable tactics? The reasons are essentially two:What with all the constraints, a drug comes to the pharmacy after huge investments. There are crippling overheads and infrastructure costs to be recovered. And there are massive profit margins to be maintained. If these were to be dependent only on genuine drug discoveries, that would be taking too great a risk.Industry players have to strike the right balance between profit making and credibility. In profit making, the marketing champions play their role. In credibility ratings, researchers and paid spokes-persons play their role. All is hunky dory till marketing is based on credibility. When there is nothing available to make for credibility, something is projected as one and marketing carried out, in the calculated hope that profits can accrue, since profit making must continue endlessly. That is what makes pharma adopt even questionable means to make profits.Essentially, there are four types of drugs. First, drugs that work and have minimal side-effects; second, drugs which work but have serious side-effects; third, drugs that do not work and have minimal side-effects; and fourth, drugs which work minimally but have serious side-effects. It is the second and fourth types that create major hassles for industry. Often, industry may try to project the fourth type as the second to escape censure.The major cat and mouse game being played by conscientious researchers is in exposing the third and fourth for what they are and not allowing industry to palm them off as the first and second type respectively. The other major game is in preventing the second type from being projected as the first. The third type are essentially harmless, so they attract censure all right and some merriment at the antics to market them. But they escape anything more than a light rap on the knuckles, except when they are projected as the first type.What is necessary for industry captains and long-term players is to realise:Their major propelling force can only be producing the first type. 2. They accept the second type only till they can lay their hands on the first. 3. The third type can be occasionally played around with to shore up profits, but never by projecting them as the first type. 4. The fourth type are the laggards, real threat to credibility and therefore do not deserve any market hype or promotion.In finding out why most pharma indulges in questionable tactics, we are lead to some interesting solutions to prevent such tactics with the least amount of hassles for all concerned, even as both profits and credibility are kept intact."}, {"Title": "A proteome analysis of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in human alcoholic patients.", "Abstract": "Alcoholic patients commonly experience cognitive decline. It is postulated that cognitive dysfunction is caused by an alcohol-induced region-selective brain damage, particularly to the prefrontal region, and grey and white matter may be affected differently. We used a proteomics-based approach to compare protein expression profiles of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9 (BA9)) from human alcoholic and healthy control brains. Changes in the relative expression of 110 protein 'spots' were identified in the BA9 grey matter, of which 54 were identified as 44 different proteins. In our recent article, 60 protein spots were differentially expressed in the BA9 white matter and 18 of these were identified (Alexander-Kaufman, K., James, G., Sheedy, D., Harper, C., Matsumoto, I., Mol. Psychiatry 2006, 11, 56-65). Additional BA9 white matter proteins are identified here and discussed in conjunction to our grey matter results. Thiamine-dependent enzymes transketolase and pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1\u03b2 ubunit) were among the proteins identified. To our knowledge, this is the first time a disruption in thiamine-dependent enzymes has been demonstrated in the brains of 'neurologically uncomplicated' alcoholics. By identifying protein expression changes in prefrontal grey and white matter separately, hypotheses may draw upon more mechanistic explanations as to how alcoholism causes the structural alterations associated with alcohol-related brain damage and cognitive dysfunction."}, {"Title": "A description of the use of music therapy in consultation-liaison psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Music therapy is gaining increasing recognition for its benefit in medical settings both for its salutary effects on physiological parameters and on psychological states associated with medical illness. This article discusses the role of a music therapist in consultation-liaison psychiatry, a specialty that provides intervention for medical and surgical patients with concomitant mental health issues.We describe the ways in which music therapy has been integrated into the consultation-liaison psychiatry service at Hahnemann University Hospital, a tertiary care facility and major trauma center in Philadelphia. The referral process and some of the techniques used in music therapy are explained. Anecdotal observations illustrate how a music therapist incorporates the various elements of music as well as the experiences of engaging in music-making to bring about changes in mood and facilitate expression of feelings and social interactions in patients who are having difficulty coping with the effects of illness and hospitalization. These methods have also been observed to have positive effects on the hospital staff by making available a means with which staff can express pressures inherent in direct patient care."}, {"Title": "Helping the helpers around the world: an interview with James S.

The ECHR judged 40 cases, and found in 35 of them that one or several rights as guaranteed by the Convention had been violated.\nThe ECHR protects the human rights of persons subjected to involuntary psychiatric commitment by creating supranational law in the following areas: definition of \"unsoundness of mind\"; conditions of lawfulness of detention; right to a review of detention by a Court; right to information; right to respect for private and family life; and conditions of confinement, which address inhuman and degrading treatment.

Given the ubiquity of this type of behavior in the repertoires of human beings and its complete absence in those of non-humans, the argument is made that animal models of human disorders, in which disturbances of conventional behaviors constitute defining features, are not sufficiently analogous to these conditions in humans to be pursued with good result. Because conventional behavior of the linguistic type is ubiquitous in the repertoires of normally developed human adults, it is suggested that the behavior of pre-verbal infants and/or non-verbal persons is preferable to that of adults as the phenomenal source for the construction of animal models of human psychological events. The observation and measurement of psychological events is held to be complicated by a number of their characteristics, including their complexity by virtue of whole organism participation, their essential complementarily with stimulus events, and the corrigibility of both form and function over their repeated occurrences, among others. The implications of these features for modeling enterprises are discussed."}, {"Title": "Genetic influences on measures of the environment: a systematic review.", "Abstract": "Traditional models of psychiatric epidemiology often assume that the relationship between individuals and their environment is unidirectional, from environment to person.

Thirty-five environmental measures in these categories were examined by at least two studies and produced weighted heritability estimates ranging from 7% to 39%, with most falling between 15% and 35%. The weighted heritability for all environmental measures in all studies was 27%. The weighted heritability for environmental measures by rating method was: self-report 29%, informant report 26%, and direct rater or videotape observation (typically examining 10 min of behavior) 14%.\nGenetic influences on measures of the environment are pervasive in extent and modest to moderate in impact.

In order to re-examine their findings, we analyzed the most significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphism in the GABRB2 gene in a sample of 367 patients with schizophrenia and 360 controls, all of German descent. Our sample had a sufficient power to detect the effects described. Neither single marker nor haplotype analysis revealed a significant association with the disease status.

Animal models provide the opportunity to decipher the relationships between the nervous system and behavior and they are an obligatory step for drug tests. Mouse models or rat models to a lesser extent could help to test for the implication of a gene using gene targeting or transfecting technologies. One of the main problem for the development of animal models is to define a marker of the psychiatric disorder. Several markers have been suggested for schizophrenia and autism, but for the moment no markers or etiopathogenic mechanisms have been identified for these disorders. We examined here animal models related to schizophrenia and autism and discussed their validity and limitations after first defining these two disorders and considering their similarities and differences. Animal models reviewed in this article test mainly behavioral dimensions or biological mechanisms related to autistic disorder or schizophrenia rather than providing specific categorical models of autism or schizophrenia. Furthermore, most of these studies focus on a behavioral dimension associated with an underlying biological mechanism, which does not correspond to the complexity of mental disorders. It could be useful to develop animal models relevant to schizophrenia or autism to test a behavioral profile associated with a biological profile. A multi-trait approach seems necessary to better understand multidimensional disorders such as schizophrenia and autism and their biological and clinical heterogeneity. Finally, animal models can help us to clarify complex mechanisms and to study relationships between biological and behavioral variables and their interactions with environmental factors. The main interest of animal models is to generate new pertinent hypotheses relevant to humans opening the path to innovative research."}, {"Title": "The Barents project in psychiatry: a systematic comparative mental health services study between Northern Norway and Archangelsk County.", "Abstract": "There is virtually no readily accessible systematically recorded evidence on how the organization of mental health services in Europe's largest country, Russia, may differ from other national systems.

These include principles derived from the Enlightenment concerning the dignity of the individual and the value of careful observation. During the 20th century, however, American psychiatry began to diverge, initially due to a much stronger emphasis on psychoanalytic principles, particularly in comparison with Great Britain. By the 1960s and 1970s, studies such as the US-UK study and the International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia demonstrated that the psychodynamic emphasis had gone too far, leading to diagnostic imprecision and inadequate evaluation of traditional evaluations of signs and symptoms of psychopathology. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition (DSM-III) was developed in this context, under the leadership of representatives from institutions that had retained the more traditional British-European approaches (eg, Washington University, Iowa). The goal of DSM-III was to create a comprehensive system for diagnosing and evaluating psychiatric patients that would be more reliable, more valid, and more consistent with international approaches. This goal was realized in many respects, but unfortunately it also had many unintended consequences. Although the original creators realized that DSM represented a \"best effort\" rather than a definitive \"ground truth,\" DSM began to be given total authority in training programs and health care delivery systems. Since the publication of DSM-III in 1980, there has been a steady decline in the teaching of careful clinical evaluation that is targeted to the individual person's problems and social context and that is enriched by a good general knowledge of psychopathology. Students are taught to memorize DSM rather than to learn complexities from the great psychopathologists of the past. By 2005, the decline has become so severe that it could be referred to as \"the death of phenomenology in the United States.\""}, {"Title": "Factor-analytic study of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale.", "Abstract": "We report on the factor structure of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale.

The continuing deinstitutionalisation process and the implementation of community mental health services was considerably affected by the reunification of East and West Germany in 1990, which required dramatic changes in the structure and quality of the mental health care system of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). Overall, German mental health care is organised as a subsidiary system, where planning and regulating mental health care is the responsibility of the 16 federal states. So German mental health care provision is spread among many sectors and characterised by considerable regional differences. A key characteristic is the particularly wide gap between inpatient and outpatient services, which are funded separately and staffed by different teams. In 2003 the total number of psychiatric beds was a mere two thirds of the overall bed capacity in 1991, the first year as a re-unified Germany, when psychiatric beds in East and West Germany totalled 80,275. From 1970 onwards the number of psychiatric beds was cut by roughly half. So the momentum of the reform has been strong enough to assimilate the completely different mental health care system of the former German Democratic Republic and, in the course of a decade, to re-structure mental health services for an additional 17-18 million new inhabitants. In an ongoing struggle to adapt to changing administrative set-ups, legal frameworks, and financial constraints, psychiatry in Germany in currently facing specific problems and is seriously challenged to defend to considerable achievements of the past. A major obstacle to achieving this aim lies in the fragmented system of mental health care provision and mental health care funding."}, {"Title": "Orexin and psychiatric symptoms in suicide attempters.", "Abstract": "The orexins (hypocretins) are recently discovered hypothalamic peptides that are involved in the regulation of sleep, appetite and state of arousal. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin and specific psychiatric symptoms in suicidal patients.\nA total of 101 patients were enrolled in the study shortly after a suicide attempt. All patients underwent a lumbar puncture after a wash-out period during which they did not receive any antipsychotic or antidepressive medication. Structured interviews were performed using the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS). CSF-orexin-A was measured and correlated with ratings of psychiatric symptoms.\nThere were significant and negative correlations between CSF-orexin and the symptoms lassitude (difficulty to initiate activities) and slowness of movement, as well as the ratings of global illness (p<0.005 for all three items, Spearman's rho).\nCorrelation analysis is an indirect method of investigation and does not demonstrate causal relationships.\nLow CSF-orexin levels are related to pronounced symptoms of inertia and reduced motor activity in suicidal patients. Interestingly, the lower the orexin levels, the higher were ratings of overall illness, as observed by a specialist in psychiatry. Our results suggest that reduced orexin levels are involved in the etiology of specific psychiatric symptoms."}, {"Title": "What can we learn from the first community-based epidemiological study on stalking in Germany?", "Abstract": "There is a lack of community-based studies on prevalence rates of stalking and the impact of stalking on victims in continental European countries. The authors published the first community-based epidemiological study on stalking in Germany. The purpose of this paper is to discuss possible implications of these epidemiological data for the mental health system, forensic psychiatry and legal regulations in Germany. For these reasons some data of our epidemiological study are outlined and reanalyzed. To examine lifetime and point prevalence rates of stalking, behavioural and psychological consequences for victims and the impact of stalking on current psychological well-being in a German community sample, a postal survey was conducted with 2000 inhabitants randomly selected from Mannheim (response rate 34.2%, n=679). The survey included a stalking questionnaire and the WHO-5 well-being scale. Almost 12% of the respondents reported having been stalked. This study identified a high lifetime prevalence of stalking in the community. Effects on victims' psychological health were significant and there was a high rate of physical (31%) and sexual (19%) violence in the context of stalking. Our data suggest that the phenomenon deserves more attention in future forensic psychiatric research and practice. Implications for forensic psychiatric assessment and treatment of stalkers as well as for management of stalking victims are discussed."}, {"Title": "Competencies.", "Abstract": "This article briefly describes the background and development of the core competencies in medicine and their relevance to various levels of medical education: undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate.

Although this organisation was aimed at insuring equal access to care whatever the place of residence, there are still huge disparities in number of staff and bed resources from one sector to another. The reduction in the number of hospital beds started later in France than in most other European countries, and was really effective in the 1990s. In 2000, there were 9.4 beds for 10,000 inhabitants aged over 20 years. Hospital-based care has still an overwhelming importance, and is associated with a marked under-development of community services and lack of sheltered housing for the most disabled patients. With more than 13,000 registered psychiatrists in France, the density of psychiatrists is one of the highest in the world. However, French psychiatry has currently to face a structural crisis due to the reduction in public health budgets, as well as to the reduction of 30% in the number of French psychiatrists over the next two decades.

History of episodes of subthreshold (i.e., 2 or more symptoms) and threshold (i.e., meeting DSM-IV criteria of elevated mood plus at least 3 symptoms, or irritable mood plus at least 4) hypomania, lasting at least 2 days, and which were the most common symptoms during the episodes, were systematically assessed.\nBipolar-II disorder (BP-II) patients (according to DSM-IV criteria, apart from hypomania duration) were 260, and major depressive disorder (MDD) patients were 162. Mood change was present in all BP-II by definition. The most common symptoms were overactivity, which was present in almost all BP-II, followed by elevated mood and racing thoughts.

Forty patients with OCD (DSM-IV, 16 women, 34.7+/-10.4 years) and 40 healthy volunteers (16 women, 34.7+/-8.7 years) were compared.

Problems in the philosophy of science with regard to psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The present interdisciplinary brain-mind debate with regard to neurobiology shows deficits in the criticism of methods and in the precision of language and argumentation. Simplifying localisations of psychic functions, insufficient explanations and over-interpretations in the sense of physical determinism are the consequence. This can be demonstrated in deficits of neurobiological theories of volitional action. Therefore, the current concept of man is less perturbed than is proposed by neurobiologists. For psychiatry besides the neurobiological approach also a separate way of building models seems to be useful if present theoretical psychology and systems science would be regarded. In particular, the systems science of natural systems offers new opportunities to bridge gaps between disciplines involved in the brain-mind debate."}, {"Title": "The practice of health care: wisdom as a model.", "Abstract": "Reasoning and judgement in health care entail complex responses to problems whose demands typically derive from several areas of specialism at once. We argue that current evidence- or value-based models of health care reasoning, despite their virtues, are insufficient to account for responses to such problems exhaustively. At the same time, we offer reasons for contending that health professionals in fact engage in forms of reasoning of a kind described for millennia under the concept of wisdom. Wisdom traditions refer to forms of deliberation which combine knowledge, reflection and life experience with social, emotional and ethical capacities. Wisdom is key in dealing with problems which are vital to human affairs but lack prescribed solutions. Uncertainty and fluidity must be tolerated in seeking to resolve them. We illustrate the application of wisdom using cases in psychiatry, where non-technical aspects of problems are often prominent and require more systematic analysis than conventional approaches offer, but we argue that our thesis applies throughout the health care field. We argue for the relevance of a threefold model of reasoning to modern health care situations in which multifaceted teamwork and complex settings demand wise judgement. A model based on practical wisdom highlights a triadic process with features activating capacities of the self (professional), other (patient and/or carers and/or colleagues) and aspects of the problem itself. Such a framework could be used to develop current approaches to health care based on case review and experiential learning."}, {"Title": "[Multiaxial classification of stalking. Guidelines for the assessment of criminal liability and prognosis].", "Abstract": "Stalking is a widespread phenomenon describing a pattern of intrusive and threatening behaviour that leads to the victim's perception of being harassed and of him or her being rendered fearful. Physical assault and even homicide may occur in the context of stalking. Anglo-Saxon studies have revealed a lifetime prevalence of being a victim of stalking ranging from 4-7% in men and 12-17% in women. Recently, these rates have been confirmed by the first community based study carried out in Germany. As a stalker can have a number of victims during his or her lifetime, the prevalence of stalkers may be less than this, although at present data for this are lacking. Although the phenomenology of stalking appears to be rather homogenous, fairly distinct stalker typologies and perpetrator-victim relationships have to be considered. Requests for psychiatric and forensic assessment of stalkers are increasing. According to the German penal code, psychiatrists must provide expert opinion on criminal responsibility and the placement of stalkers. So far, all typologies of stalkers refer to the Anglo-Saxon cultural background and do not consider the special needs of German forensic psychiatry. In particular, the psychopathological dimension is widely neglected in common typologies. The present paper proposes a multiaxial typology of stalking that considers the psychopathological dimension, the relationship between stalker and victim and motivational aspects. Consequences for the forensic psychiatric assessment according to section 20, 21 StGB are outlined. It should be pointed out that stalking is not a new diagnostic category, but only involves, at a descriptive level, deviation from a normal behavioural pattern. The central components of the forensic psychiatric assessment remain the known diagnostic categories, the effects of which on behaviour can be analysed."}, {"Title": "A competency-based approach to managing violence with involuntary outpatient treatment.", "Abstract": "Involuntary outpatient treatment is one of the most controversial areas in public psychiatry.

Female students and students with psychiatry/psychotherapy experience had a significantly more positive attitude towards psychiatry as a subject. Overall 5.8% of all students showed a very positive attitude towards psychiatry.\nA positive education experience as well as personal experience increases the probability of a positive student attitude towards psychiatry. In order to assure adequate care for the mentally ill, it should be a fundamental aim of medical education to promote positive attitudes towards the mentally ill and psychiatry.

Besides the scientific domain of psychiatry, time consciousness is a topic that has been extensively studied both by theoretical philosophy and cognitive neuroscience. It can be shown that both approaches exemplified by the philosophical analysis of time consciousness (Husserl) and the neuroscientific theory of cross-temporal contingencies (binding of cognitive processes over time) as the neurophysiological basis of human consciousness implemented in the prefrontal cortex (Fuster) converge in 2 respects. Firstly, a tripartite conception of consciousness divides human cognition in 3 different temporal domains comprising retention, presentation, and protention (Husserl) and the past, the present, and the future corresponding to working memory, interference control, and preparatory set (Fuster). Secondly, both concepts refer to the present as an extended duration that integrates information from the recent past and the future. We propose that the integration of phenomenological and neuroscientific approaches can stimulate the development of enriched pathophysiological concepts of mental disorders. This approach appears to be particularly fruitful with respect to schizophrenia that is interpreted as a structural disturbance of time consciousness."}, {"Title": "Performing a cure for schizophrenia: insulin coma therapy on the wards.", "Abstract": "Most historians of psychiatry regard insulin coma therapy (ICT) either as an embarrassing stumble on the path to modern biological psychiatry or as one member of a long line of somatic therapies used to treat mental illness in the mid-twentieth century. This article explores the ICT era, roughly 1933-60, as a key moment in the development of American psychiatry. Developed only ten years after insulin had been embraced as a \"miracle drug\" for the treatment of diabetes, ICT was perceived by psychiatrists as a means of bringing their field closer to mainstream medicine, particularly to neurology. In addition, the story of ICT reveals how a treatment never quite proven on paper was unquestionably efficacious in the local world in which it was performed. An institutionally-based treatment, ICT was administered in a specific area of the mental hospital deemed the insulin unit, a room with its own staff, practices, and attitudes toward mental illness. There, psychiatrists often experienced wondrous recoveries of individual, formerly intractable patients. These intense personal experiences allowed psychiatrists to feel truly efficacious, enabling them to reinvent themselves as medical doctors rather than behavioral and disciplinary supervisors. The confidence they derived from this capacity, along with the operating room-like setting of the insulin unit, the unit's specialized staffing and group bond, and the availability of both risk-assessment tests and a medley of treatments that countered side effects and complications, allowed ICT to be understood as an efficacious treatment for schizophrenia within the local world in which it was administered."}, {"Title": "Concept of disease in geriatric psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The concept of disease in geriatric psychiatry has to keep up with the rapid expansion in knowledge about the putative etiology of various diseases of interest.

The objective of this paper is to review the current literature on combining non-clozapine atypical antipsychotics as well as discussing the theoretical benefits and risks, and summarizing the implications for clinical practice. We found in cases of treatment-resistant schizophrenia, where clozapine is deemed inappropriate, combination therapy with non-clozapine atypical antipsychotics is a strategy worthy of consideration. Combinations using olanzapine with either amisulpride or risperidone--or quetiapine with risperidone--in theory act on different receptor profiles and in the limited data available have shown improvement in symptoms, been used most frequently, and on balance have more data on safety. Initial case reports suggest that aripiprazole combined with non-clozapine atypicals may worsen psychosis. The current literature, however, has significant limitations. For this reason, due to the lack of data on safety, caution is recommended. There needs to be further well-designed studies with the aim to specifically investigate the effects of combination therapy to allow the clinician to better balance the risks and benefits (both clinical and economical) of treatment."}, {"Title": "Benzodiazepines--a necessary evil? A survey of prescribing at a specialist UK psychiatric hospital.", "Abstract": "Guidelines on the prescription of benzodiazepines recommend their use be limited to the short-term relief of severe anxiety or insomnia. However, clinical experience suggests that in psychiatry these drugs may be being prescribed more widely. The aim of this survey was to investigate benzodiazepine prescribing in a specialist UK psychiatric hospital using a structured interview with consultant psychiatrists. Prescribers were also asked their views on the UK CSM guidance on benzodiazepines (1988). Of 412 inpatients, 77 (18.7%) were receiving 90 benzodiazepine prescriptions for psychiatric indications. Most prescriptions were for anxiety (45/90; 50.0%), aggression (23/90; 25.6%) and agitation (13/90; 14.4%). Use was commonest for acquired brain injury, schizophrenia and personality disorders. Much usage was chronic (only 4/90 (4.4%) prescriptions had been initiated within the previous 4 weeks) and off-label (85/90; 94.4%). Prescribers were concerned about the addictive nature of benzodiazepines for these patients and to a lesser extent about their abuse potential. Most consultants believed the UK CSM guidance was too restrictive in relation to their clinical practice and needed modification to encompass new indications, for example rapid tranquillization, and specialist prescribing. In psychiatry benzodiazepines are quite frequently used in the management of a number of groups of difficult-to-treat patients. Although largely not evidence based, some psychiatrists report a favourable risk-benefit ratio for benzodiazepines in the treatment of certain patients."}, {"Title": "Evidence-based guidelines for management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adolescents in transition to adult services and in adults: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology.", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an established diagnosis in children, associated with a large body of evidence on the benefits of treatment. Adolescents with ADHD are now leaving children's services often with no readily identifiable adult service to support them, which presents problems as local pharmacy regulations often preclude the prescription of stimulant drugs by general practitioners (GPs). In addition, adults with ADHD symptoms are now starting to present to primary care and psychiatry services requesting assessment and treatment. For these reasons, the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) thought it timely to hold a consensus conference to review the body of evidence on childhood ADHD and the growing literature on ADHD in older age groups. Much of this initial guidance on managing ADHD in adolescents in transition and in adults is based on expert opinion derived from childhood evidence. We hope that, by the time these guidelines are updated, much evidence will be available to address the many directions for future research that are detailed here."}, {"Title": "Determining problems experienced by student nurses in their work with clinical educators in Turkey.", "Abstract": "Clinical education is considered an indispensable and vital part of nursing education.

Students encounter certain problems during their clinical practice under the supervision of educators. This study was conducted to determine the nature of the problems student nurses encounter during clinical training in Turkey. The focus-group interviews were used for this study. Three groups of 8, a total group of 24, composed of students completing their third year were included in the interviews. The students in this study had completed their practical training in the departments of internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, psychiatry and public health. Among the problems mostly encountered by students, as established by the study, were inadequate assessment by the clinical educator, judgment, negative feedback, communication problems, inadequate guidance and overload.

The children were placed in one of three behavior problem groups (low behavior problems, risk for externalizing problems, risk for mixed externalizing/internalizing problems) based on their scores on the Child Behavior Checklist for 4-18-year-olds [Achenbach, T.M., 1991. Integrative guide for the 1991 CBCL/4-18, YSR & TRF profiles. University of Vermont Department of Psychiatry, Burlington, VT], completed by their mothers. To assess cardiac vagal regulation, resting measures of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and RSA change (vagal withdrawal) to five emotionally and behaviorally challenging tasks were derived. In addition, heart period (HP) and heart period change (HR acceleration) was examined. Results indicated that the behavior problem groups did not differ in terms of resting measures of either RSA or HP. Analyses of the challenge tasks indicated that the children at risk for mixed problems displayed greater cardiac vagal withdrawal across the five tasks than did the other two groups of children. There was a trend for the children at risk for externalizing problems to display less vagal withdrawal than the control group. In addition, the children at risk for mixed problems displayed greater heart rate acceleration to the tasks than did the other two groups of children. Follow-up analyses indicated that the greater cardiac acceleration observed in the mixed group was largely a function of greater vagal withdrawal. These findings are discussed in terms of the emotion regulatory function of cardiac vagal regulation, and its implications for patterns of risk for behavior problems in young children."}, {"Title": "Comparison of two diagnostic systems for Complicated Grief.", "Abstract": "To date, there are mainly two diagnostic systems that have been proposed for the diagnosis of Complicated Grief [Horowitz, M.J., Siegel, B., Holen, A., Bonanno, G.A., Milbrath, C., Stinson, C.H., 1997.

The Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used as an outcome measure of depression. Genotyping was performed using fluorescent allele-specific TaqMan probes. No association between either G196A or C270T and the response to ECT was found in the whole population. There were no significant differences in responses between men and women or between psychotic and non-psychotic patients.

The current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and International Classification of Diseases both reflect, at least in part, that legacy. This article will argue that the descriptive psychopathology of Jaspers has been gradually transformed into a caricature which has substituted authority for enquiry and simplification for subtlety. We have been left with classificatory systems which impose reified categories increasingly at variance with clinical reality and increasingly divorced from the data generated by scientific enquiry.

Although phenothiazine antipsychotic drugs have been reported to directly interact with the peripheral plasma membrane, it is not known whether these drugs actually affect plasma membrane integrity in the central nervous system. To clarify these issues, we investigated the effect of chlorpromazine (CPZ), a typical phenothiazine antipsychotic drug, on plasma membrane permeability in fresh rat brain slices using a dynamic positron autoradiography technique and [(18)F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) as a tracer. Treatment with CPZ (> or =100 microM) resulted in the leakage of [(18)F]FDG-6-phosphate, but not [(18)F]FDG, suggesting that the [(18)F]FDG-6-phosphate efflux was not mediated by glucose transporters, but rather by plasma membrane permeabilization. The leakage of [(18)F]FDG-6-phosphate was followed by slower leakage of cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting that CPZ could initially induce small membrane holes that enlarged with time. Furthermore, the addition of CPZ (> or =100 microM) caused a decrease in 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene fluorescence anisotropy, which implies an increase in membrane fluidity. CPZ loading dose-dependently increased both membrane permeability and membrane fluidity, which suggested the involvement of a perturbation of membrane order in the mechanisms of membrane destabilization induced by antipsychotic drugs."}, {"Title": "Clinicians' attitudes to spirituality in old age psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The aim of this survey is to investigate professional attitudes to the presence and value of spiritual care from Old Age Psychiatrists.\nAll registered members of the Faculty of the Psychiatry of Old Age in the United Kingdom were asked to complete a 21-question semi-structured questionnaire.

Cognitive inhibition is often invoked to explain performance in psychiatric illness. Yet it remains only a general conceptual model of executive dysfunction. Premotor theory proposes both neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological equivalents of conscious and unconscious processes. The interaction between monoaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission is stated to have an inverse effect on these two fundamental psychological processes. If one conceives of cognitive inhibition as a failure to voluntarily suppress unconscious prepotent responses, then a deficit in monoaminergic antagonism of cholinergic facilitated prepotent responses accounts for the observed behavioural phenotypes. The plasticity of behaviour is further hypothesized to have an equivalent in intracellular signalling leading to plastic changes in neural networks. Apart from inhibition of prepotent responses it permits the formulation of new behavioural phenotypes. At the receptor level Gi-Gq/11 transduction coupling is proposed to mediate this effect. A hypofunctioning monoaminergic system is thought to underlie the clinical pictures of major depression and ADHD. The neurocognitive deficits of depression include memory loss, poor concentration and rumination. ADHD is characterized by inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Both these syndromes effectively respond to raising serotonin and dopamine levels, respectively. The core symptoms can usefully be attributed to an imbalance between the neuromodulatory effects of monoamines and ACh. Taking the model of monoaminergic-muscarinic receptor interactions presented previously and extended here, a new hypothesis is proposed for the core symptoms of ADHD. Accordingly, impulsivity and hyperactivity result from impaired dopaminergic inhibition and remodelling of muscarinic mediated prepotent responses. The model also predicts memory impairment in major depression by proposing that low serotonin levels in the neocortex is linked to focal hippocampal dysfunction. Hippocampal theta is proposed to trigger phasic monoaminergic activation involved in encoding of cortical traces and plasticity of propotent networks. It proposes a hypothesis for the enhancement of mood and behaviour induced by antidepressants is partly a response to plasticity of neural networks, that is, remodelling of cholinergic-mediated negative habitual behaviours."}, {"Title": "Effects of rivastigmine on actigraphically monitored motor activity in severe agitation related to Alzheimer's disease: a placebo-controlled pilot study.", "Abstract": "Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are effective in the treatment of cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

A total of 20 consecutive AD inpatients (13 females, 7 males, 80.4+/-9.1 years, S.D.) were included from our geriatric psychiatry unit, all of whom were exhibiting agitated behavior not attributable to delirium. Patients were assigned randomly and in a single-blinded fashion to rivastigmine 3mg or placebo for 14 days. Motor activity levels were monitored using an actigraph worn continuously on the wrist of the non-dominant hand. At the beginning and end of the study, patients were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Nurses' Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients (NOSGER). Patients in the rivastigmine group exhibited less agitation than placebo recipients on the NPI-agitation subscale, but not on NOSGER. Actigraphic measurements showed a tendency towards reduced motor activity in the rivastigmine group. Because rivastigmine usually exerts its main effects after a longer period of time, the short-term effects seen in our study justify further controlled clinical trials examining the use of rivastigmine in BPSD by means of actigraphy."}, {"Title": "Measuring behavioural susceptibility to obesity: validation of the child eating behaviour questionnaire.", "Abstract": "The Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ; [Wardle, J., Guthrie, C.A., Sanderson, S., & Rapoport, L.

The goal of this retrospective analysis was to determine if chronic smoking affected brain structure in the non-treatment-seeking heavy drinking sample from our earlier report (i.e., Cardenas et al., 2005). Regional volumetric comparisons were made among age-matched smoking HD (n=17), non-smoking HD (n=16), and non-smoking light drinkers (nsLD; n=20) from our original sample. Quantitative volumetric measures of neocortical gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), subcortical structures, and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) were derived from high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Smoking HD demonstrated smaller volumes than nsLD in the frontal, parietal, temporal GM, and for total neocortical GM. Smoking HD also demonstrated smaller temporal and total GM volumes than non-smoking HD. Non-smoking HD and nsLD did not differ significantly on GM volumes. Further, the three groups did not differ on lobar WM, subcortical structures or regional CSF volumes.

The relationships between the participants' background, aspects of the learning environment, their attitudes to psychiatry, psychiatric competence and psychiatric self-confidence were explored in order to develop an empirical model of the learning process.The participants were medical students at the University of Tromsoe, Norway. The study was prospective and based on students' self-reports, Structural panel modelling and growth curve analyses were used to explore the complex interactions between the variables over time and to create a model of the learning processes. The medical students significantly increased their subjective competence and psychiatric self-confidence during their clerkship in psychiatry and maintained them during their internship. Previous psychiatric experience, attitudes towards psychiatry and current psychiatric experience contributed to subjective psychiatric competence, Competence in turn had a positive effect on self-confidence. Interestingly, those with greater subjective competence also appeared to have more psychiatric experience during their internship. An empirical model of the important aspects of the learning process was developed."}, {"Title": "Cognitive interviews for measurement evaluation of the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) in smokers with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.", "Abstract": "People diagnosed with schizophrenia have among the highest known rates of tobacco use. While the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) is the most widely used measure of nicotine dependence, recent research has questioned its applicability for individuals with schizophrenia. The current study employed cognitive interviews to evaluate the FTND with smokers diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, recruited from an acute inpatient psychiatry setting, and a comparison group of smokers recruited from the community. The groups were comparable on tobacco use variables and FTND scores. Detailed qualitative cognitive interviews indicated all subjects understood the FTND items. For both groups, the FTND missed nocturnal smoking, reported as weekly by 80% of patients and 47% of controls. Finishing other people's cigarettes also was under-reported on the FTND. Restrictions to smoking were common across groups. The cognitive interview methodology proved useful for understanding how individuals interpreted and answered the FTND items. Overall, the qualitative findings identified limitations in the FTND for both groups, with the limitations generally more pronounced among patients with schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "A randomized controlled trial of the effect of D-cycloserine on exposure therapy for spider fear.", "Abstract": "Previous research [Hofmann SG, Meuret AE, Smits JA, Simon NM, Pollack MH, Eisenmenger K, et al.

We used a well established intervention to evaluate the effectiveness of administering DCS as an adjunct to exposure therapy in a heightened, but sub-clinical, fear population. Over two studies, 100 spider-fearful participants were allocated to DCS or placebo before treatment and were assessed at pre-, immediate post-, and 3.5 weeks post-treatment. Significant treatment effects and return of fear was observed at follow-up, particularly in non-treatment contexts; however, both studies failed to demonstrate any enhancing effects of DCS (50 or 500 mg). DCS did not enhance the reduction of spider fears or the generalisation of treatment of a single session of exposure-based therapy. These results suggest that DCS may not enhance loss of non-clinical levels of fear in human populations."}, {"Title": "Clinical characteristics of bipolar disorder in very young children.", "Abstract": "Clinical information about bipolar disorder (BPD) in preschool-age (3-7 years old) children is extremely limited. This study examined clinical presentations, applicability of the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, comorbidity, recovery and relapse rates, as well as some treatment strategies used in the management of BPD in preschoolers.\nThe charts of 26 outpatient children, ages 3-7, refereed to a child psychiatry outpatient clinic with mood and behavioral symptoms, were retrospectively reviewed.\nThe majority of the patients were referred with the tentative diagnosis of ADHD but the most common diagnoses made by child and adolescent psychiatrists at the time of initial evaluation were BPD NOS (61.5%), followed by BPD I (26.9%), and mood disorder NOS (23.1%). Thirty-eight percent of the patients had one or more comorbid diagnoses. The most common presenting symptoms were irritability (84.6%) and aggression (88.5%). The most widely prescribed class of medications after diagnosis in the clinic was atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. Twenty-six percent of the patients were treated with a combination of atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizers.\nRetrospective design; small sample size; lack of a comparison group.\nThe course of BPD with onset in preschool years is complicated with high recovery and relapse rates.

South Beach Psychiatric Center (SBPC) has made specific use of a best practices report which details proportions of caseloads and number of patients on two or more concurrent antipsychotic medications. Psychiatrists received extensive application and desktop support and individual and group training was conducted. PSYCKES current and historical medication regimens were reviewed for individual cases and best practices reports were used in psychiatry supervision from January 2004 to March 2005. SBPC psychiatrists achieved marked reductions in the proportions of their caseloads on two or more concurrent antipsychotics.

The genes encoding the serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (DAT1) transporters are among the possible candidate genes modulating an individual's antidepressant response. In a naturalistic prospective cohort study with a total of 190 fully assessed patients, improvement of depression symptoms during the 3 weeks following initiation of antidepressant therapy was recorded using the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). The SLC6A3 3' UTR 40-bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and the SLC6A4 5' 44-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. There was a significantly smaller number of rapid responders among homozygous carriers of the DAT1 9-repeat allele (9/9) than among heterozygous (9/10) and homozygous (10/10) carriers of the 10-repeat allele (19 versus 37 versus 52%, respectively, P=0.0037). Median decline in HDRS score was 35, 40, and 52% in patients with the 9/9, 9/10, and 10/10 genotypes, respectively (P=0.013). The effect was found in all classes of medications (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclics, mirtazapine, venlafaxine) and statistically significant also within the subgroup of patients having received SSRIs. The serotonin promoter insertion/deletion genotype had no effect in the entire study group, but there was an insignificant trend of better response in the l/l and l/s carriers who received SSRIs or mirtazapine. In conclusion, the dopamine transporter VNTR polymorphism influenced rapid response to antidepressant therapy. Compared with homozygous carriers of the 10-repeat allele, carriers of the 9/10 genotype had an odds ratio (OR) calculated by logistic regression analysis of 1.6 (95% CI 0.8-3.2) and carriers of the 9/9 genotype had an OR of 6.0 (1.5-24.4) for no or poor response. Further studies are required to confirm this clinical association and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms."}, {"Title": "Enhanced perceptual priming for neutral stimuli occurring in a traumatic context: two experimental investigations.", "Abstract": "Intrusive memories in posttraumatic stress disorder are often triggered by stimuli that are perceptually similar to those present shortly before or during the trauma. The present study aims to examine the possible role of perceptual priming in this phenomenon. It further investigates whether the degree of perceptual priming is associated with dissociation and whether both perceptual priming and intrusive memories can be reduced through elaboration. Two experiments measured perceptual priming for neutral stimuli that immediately preceded a \"traumatic\" event. Volunteers (N=46, 92) watched a series of \"traumatic\" and neutral picture stories, and completed a blurred object identification (perceptual priming) memory task, and a recognition memory task. Participants in Experiment 1 were selected to score either high or low on the Trait Dissociation Questionnaire [Murray, Ehlers, & Mayou (2002). Dissociation and posttraumatic stress disorder: Two prospective studies of motor vehicle accident survivors. British Journal of Psychiatry, 180, 363-368]. They also completed a state dissociation measure in the session. Experiment 2 randomly allocated participants to an experimental condition designed to increase elaboration or to a control condition. This experiment also included a measure of intrusive memories. Both experiments found enhanced perceptual priming for the stimuli that immediately preceded the \"traumatic\" stories compared to those preceding neutral stories. Participants with high trait dissociation showed relatively stronger perceptual perceptual priming. The degree of perceptual priming for stimuli from the \"traumatic\" stories also correlated with state dissociation (Experiment 1). Experimental manipulation of the elaboration of the stories showed that elaboration reduced the enhanced perceptual priming effect and the relative probability of reexperiencing symptoms (Experiment 2). The results support the role of perceptual priming in intrusions after traumatic events."}, {"Title": "History of experimental psychology from an Estonian perspective.", "Abstract": "A short review of the development of experimental psychology from an Estonian perspective is presented. The first rector after the reopening of the University of Dorpat (Tartu) in 1802, Georg Friedrich Parrot (1767-1852) was interested in optical phenomena which he attempted to explain by introducing the concept of unconscious inferences, anticipating a similar theory proposed by Herman von Helmholtz 20 years later. One of the next rectors, Alfred Wilhelm Volkmann (1800-1878) was regarded by Edwin Boring as one of the founding fathers of the experimental psychology. Georg Wilhelm Struve (1793-1864) played an essential part in solving the problem of personal equations. Arthur Joachim von Oettingen (1836-1920) developed a theory of music harmony, which stimulated his student Wilhelm Friedrich Ostwald (1853-1932) to study colour harmony. Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926), the founder of modern psychiatry, is by far the most important experimental psychologist who has worked in Estonia. His successor Wladimir von Tchisch (1855-1922), another student of Wilhelm Wundt, continued Kraepelin's work in experimental psychology. The lives of Wolfgang K\u00f6hler (1887-1967), who was born in Reval (Tallinn), and Oswald K\u00fclpe (1862-1915), who graduated from the University of Dorpat, extended the link between the history of experimental psychology and Estonia. Karl Gustav Girgensohn (1875-1925), the founder of the Dorpat School of the psychology of religion, stretched the use of experimental methods to the study of religious experience."}, {"Title": "[On the history of taking up the word \"irre\" and its derived forms into the nomenclature of German psychiatry].", "Abstract": "At the threshold from the 18th to the 19th century, the development of the psychiatry in Germany - as a subject of science and as a health service - made it necessary to find adequate terms for the new perception of mental illness and people suffering from it. At that time, some more or less discriminating expressions with origins in the medieval or early modern German, some words derived from the Latin language of scientists, and some new terms used in contemporary theories on the explanation of psychic disorder, constituted \"eine verwirrende Vielfalt der Gattungsnamen f\u00fcr psychische Krankheit\" (a confusing multiplicity of names for mental illness) - (F. Nasse 1818). To make an end to this multiplicity, in the last decade of the 18th century some experts proposed to use terms derived from the word \"irre\" as standard expressions for illness, symptoms and patients in psychiatry as well as for the new elements of the emerging psychiatric health sector. The word \"irre\" with the meaning \"geistig gest\u00f6rt\" (mentally disordered) was part of the German vocabulary since the end of the Middle Ages. According to its advocates, it seemed to be suitable as new standard term, because it was not linked to discriminating prejudices with respect to its origin and to the understanding of that time. Therefore it met the contemporary demand for a more humanitarian behaviour towards ill people. But it took 20 years of discussion and clarification until this nomenclature was accepted in the new subject psychiatry and rested well established for nearly the next 100 years."}, {"Title": "[Assessing psychopathic personality disorders for legal procedures for using a version for adolescents of Hare's revised checklist].", "Abstract": "In accordance with Robert Hare's concept, the term psychopathy was operationalized in 1985 when the revised form of the psychopathy checklist (PCL-R) was published. Since then, the PCL-R has been used internationally. For several years in North America and now even in England and the Netherlands, personality traits of psychopathy have also been studied in children and juveniles. Based on the PCL-R, a checklist for adolescents (PCL-YV) was developed that takes the special conditions of adolescents into account. The goal of this paper was to test the applicability of the PCL-YV retrospectively in a sample of forensic psychiatric evaluations of delinquent juveniles that were assigned to the Clinic for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of Cologne, Germany. Based on results collected with the PCL-YV, data on groups of low- and medium-scoring juveniles were classified which partially differed significantly in relation to sociodemographic and anamnestic data. Furthermore, factor analyses showed a three-factor model solution. Associations with legal issues such as the question of criminal responsibility could not be found. In summary, the results indicate the applicability of the PCL-YV for adolescents but show the difficulties of retrospective design without conducting PCL interviews."}, {"Title": "[Accelerating consult letter time in inpatient psychiatric and psychotherapeutic care].", "Abstract": "Consult letters are the main way of relaying information between attending physicians involved in patient treatment at different levels of care and should therefore reach continuing care physicians with minimal delay. The quality assurance project described here was intended to reduce dispatch times for inpatient consult letters at our department of psychiatry and psychotherapy. To accomplish this, different measures were put to work at two levels of intervention. These included standardizing work flow, centralizing and optimizing work distribution in the secretaries' office, enabling faster access to typewritten consult letters by way of central data storage on the clinic's server, sending email notifications to all persons involved, using a central office for signing letters, and prompt monitoring and reporting of consult letter delays. These interventions helped reduce the average delay of dispatching consult letters from 29 days to 11. All in all, the project led to a high degree of workplace satisfaction for all persons involved and should be adaptable to other departments and units without difficulty. In our own department, ward-specific consult letter efficiency has become an important quality indicator."}, {"Title": "[Experience with new teaching methods and testing in psychiatric training].", "Abstract": "In 1999, the Charit\u00e9 Medical University in Berlin, Germany, implemented a reformed medical study course (RMSC) along with traditional undergraduate medical education. The RMSC is characterized by problem-based learning (PBL), training in communication skills with \"simulated patients\", and interdisciplinary seminars. The curriculum is organized into blocks according to organ system and age (period od life). In a new intensive 4-week psychiatric block, 4th-year students get practical experience in psychiatric wards. Furthermore, PBL groups and workshops are offered that focus on frequent psychiatric disorders. By providing interactive courses with simulated patients, students are intensively trained in taking psychiatric histories and in generating psychopathological findings. Defined learning objectives are tested using multiple-choice items and objectively structured clinical examinations at semester end. First positive results indicate that this course represents an appropriate and practicable curriculum for teaching psychiatry in Germany."}]
