[{"Title": "Recurrent abdominal pain among a sample of Egyptian children in relation to family and school related problems.", "Abstract": "Recurrent Abdominal pain (RAP) is a common feature of growing children especially above the age of five. It may be experienced for either organic or non-organic (psychogenic) reasons. The main objective of the present study is to investigate the possible relation between the occurrence of RAP and some family and school related problems. It is a descriptive cross sectional study designed to assess children aged 7-12 years, of both sexes, attending El-Salam health insurance clinic (Eastern Cairo) for their RAP. Seven hundred children (400 boys and 300 girls) suffering from RAP were investigated. They were subjected to routine investigations (urine and stool analysis, complete blood picture, x-ray abdomen) to exclude the possible organic cause for their RAP. A specially designed questionnaire for the purpose of the present study was applied after testing its validity (it was judged by 10 professors of Psychology, Psychiatry and community medicine before its use). It was applied individually on each child (or his/her caregiver). Data were collected from each subject as regard: His/her personal history, socio-demographic characteristics, characters of RAP (its type, severity, onset, duration, frequency, site and its relation to other symptoms), some organic and psychological symptoms and history of family troubles and school related problems. Data were collected, tabulated and analyzed using Chi- square test to compare children of organic and non-organic RAP. Results revealed that RAP was mostly non-organic in origin (65.7%). It was commonly associated with family troubles (59.7%) and school related problems (40.3%). Children with non-organic RAP expressed many psychological symptoms especially; tantrums (41.1%), phobias related to school (17.4%) as well as continuous crying (13%) and appetite loss (14%). There was significant female predominance (p = 0.0000) in expressing RAP in direct relation to family troubles and school related problems compared to boys. Non-organic RAP was described as mild (68.2%), gradual (64.3%), poorly localized (79.6%) pain, that was experienced more or less on daily basis (79%), and lasts for shorter duration (68.5%) [less than 15 minutes]. It was commonly associated with headaches (46.9%), diarrhea (36.9%), and other pains all over the body (13.4%). It was related neither to meals or to sleep (71.1%). On the other hand, RAP (both organic and non-organic) was not significantly related to child's socio-demographic background. Results were discussed and interpreted with results of other researchers. Many recommendations were introduced for proper assessment and management of such children."}, {"Title": "Frequency of the antipsychotic therapy acute side effects in the treatment of acute psychosis.", "Abstract": "Antipsychotic drugs produce a wide spectrum of physiological actions. Some of these effects differ among the various classes of antipsychotics. This medications have indications in the treatment of acute psychotic disorders. The main goal of this investigation was to determine the incidence and prevalence of the neuroleptic therapy acute side effects. The reason for this epidemiological investigation performing was the lack of knowledge of the exact neuroleptic therapy side effects incidence. Qualitative study on this problem has not been performed yet. Antipsychotic therapy side effects prevalence rate according to the literature data is ranging from 24% to 74%. Different prevalence rate is a consequence of different antipsychotic drug usage, different drug administration method and different side effects identification. On account of all these facts, we put the hypothesis on the correlation between the antipsychotic therapy and occurred side effects. Our experiment included all patients hospitalised from December 31st 1999 to January 31st 2000 in Intensive Care Unit of Biological Psychiatry Department of Psychiatric Clinic in Sarajevo. All patients were divided in three groups according to the applied therapy. All of them met ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia (F20-29). During our study the following examinations were performed: psychiatric interview, BRPS, scale of side effects, psychophysiological tests, general clinical impression, scale of appetite, carbon hydrate needs scale. Psychiatric and statistical evaluations were done as well. The evaluation of our examination is showing successful results in all groups of patients. The improvement of psychopathological symptoms was insignificant. Reported side effects were minimal with low incidence rate and relatively high prevalence rate. Statistical tests were calculated from the obtained data after what the null hypothesis was rejected. Consequently, an alternative hypothesis was confirmed and it indicated that the acute side effects incidence and prevalence were within the range of expectation. Intensity of the recorded side effects was moderate to mild. On the basis of the obtained data, it has been concluded that applied antipsychotic agents did not induce more psychophysiological function impairments in the treated patients. Psychophysiological functions remained in physiological range limits and their changes were not significant. Neuroleptic therapy side effects were minimal, meaning no toxic signs or therapy discontinuations were recorded."}, {"Title": "Frequency and characteristics of side effects associated with antidepressant drugs.", "Abstract": "Depression is among the most common of chronic health problems. WHO report predicts that depression will be the leading cause of disability in the industrial world by the year 2020. To be successful, treatment for the patients suffering from depression must be continued until complete recovery, but most patients do not stay on their antidepressant medication long enough. One of the most frequent reasons for break down is appearance of unpleasant side effects. In this study we followed up dynamics of the characteristic side effects of antidepressant therapy, with the major goal to assess their frequency and characteristics. The sample was all female patients taking antidepressant drugs in the Department of Psychiatry of Clinical Centre of University in Sarajevo. The treatment with antidepressants was efficient in most of the patients. A major advantage of SSRI over TCA was less pronounced side effects. The most intensive side effects of TCA (amitriptyline) were dry mouth, tremor and tachycardia while the most frequent side effects included blurred vision, tachycardia, dry mouth, tremor and sedation. Side effects of SSRI (fluoxetine/fluvoxamine) were mild, and the most frequent were nausea, tachycardia, swelling, dry mouth."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric disturbances in children of parents with bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "The early symptoms of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents are often qualitatively different from the classic symptoms of mania and depression that present in adults, complicating the diagnosis of the disorder in younger populations. The focus of this article is the evaluation and treatment of children with bipolar parents who begin to develop behavioral and other psychiatric problems. The authors first review the current criteria available for diagnosing bipolar disorder in children. They consider issues related to how the DSM-IV criteria have been applied in this population, in particular the increase in the number of children diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a result of the decision to allow a \"manic\" episode to be diagnosed in the absence of expansive or elated mood. The practice parameters for the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents developed by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry are also discussed. The literature concerning children of parents with bipolar disorder is reviewed and indicates that these children are at increased risk for a wide range of psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorders, other affective disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, and other psychiatric illnesses. The authors then review what is known about treatment for the early symptoms of bipolar disorder in this population and discuss the utility of mood stabilizers. The authors then discuss the role genomic screening may play in the future in identifying children at the highest risk for developing bipolar disorder. The article concludes with a summary of several endophenotypic expressions of bipolar disorder that have been described in children of parents with bipolar disorder."}, {"Title": "[Frequency of relapse among hospitalized patients at the psychiatric department].", "Abstract": "The study aims to assess the epidemiology of relapse occurrence among inpatients at the Department of Psychiatry of Fann Teaching Hospital, in Dakar. A retrospective and prospective study was conducted from inpatients records during the year 1998. Demographic and disease related datas were collected and analyzed using a microcomputer with WHO/CDC Epi Info 6.0 software. Among the inpatients, 160 presented a relapse representing a prevalence rate of 40.8%. The most incriminated diseases were: schizophrenia and mood trouble (56.3% and 28.7% respectively). Relapses occurs more during the first admission and decreased with readmission. As a real public health problem, there is a need for better management of all psychiatric disease to prevent relapsus: early and efficient health care, social and familial integration."}, {"Title": "Overview of economic evaluation of positron-emission tomography.", "Abstract": "Since the 1990s positron-emission tomography (PET) in Germany has been used increasingly in clinical diagnostics in the areas of oncology, cardiology, and neurology/ psychiatry.

This contribution summarizes and discusses the results of a health technology assessment report on the cost-effectiveness of PET."}, {"Title": "Factors contributing to failed trials of new agents: can technology prevent some problems?", "Abstract": "For psychiatry to contribute to the development of the next generation of antidepressant pharmacotherapies, effective use of clinical trial methods is as critical as innovation in neurochemical research. Results from clinical trials on the efficacy of a new drug can be obscured by methodological problems. Accurate diagnosis and precise measurement of the clinical symptoms during conduct of the clinical trials are crucial to obtaining interpretable outcomes. As tools that reliably diagnose disorders and assess symptoms become available, computer administration of rating instruments may improve the accuracy of clinical trial results. This article describes methodological factors that can confound study outcomes and discusses the potential for interactive voice response (IVR) technology to address some of these problems."}, {"Title": "A boy who stops taking stimulants for \"ADHD\": commentaries on a Pediatrics case study.", "Abstract": "This article presents eight commentaries on a case study published in the journal Pediatrics in 2001. The case study, introduced in Pediatrics to highlight the issue of adolescents' compliance with drug treatment in a \"high-prevalence neurobehavioral condition,\" briefly describes an adolescent boy who announces that he no longer needs the methylphenidate he was prescribed for ADHD and had been taking for the last five years. We invited experienced professionals from the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, counseling, education, and occupational therapy to comment on the case and make recommendations to the adolescent boy in the case study, his family, and professionals. Their commentaries highlight issues rarely discussed in the mainstream literature, including: the extent to which ADHD is erroneously portrayed and vigorously managed as a disease; the lack of validity of the ADHD construct in adolescence; the widespread use of stimulants as performance-enhancing drugs; the need to respect an adolescent's gut instinct and developing decisions; the importance of family dynamics in ADHD-like situations; the need to ease stimulant withdrawal effects; and the human rights of children prescribed psychotropic drugs."}, {"Title": "Studies of anticipation in bipolar affective disorder.", "Abstract": "Anticipation refers to the increase in disease severity or decrease in age of onset in successive generations. The concept evolved from the theories and dogma of degeneration that were pervasive in psychiatry and medicine in the late 19th century and into the early 20th century. The term was set aside with the criticism of geneticist Lionel Penrose, who argued that anticipation was the result of ascertainment biases. The renewed interest in anticipation followed the identification of its molecular genetic basis in the form of unstable trinucleotide repeats. Subsequently, several diseases have been studied clinically for the presence of anticipation. Although anticipation has been identified in many diseases, including bipolar disorder, only diseases showing a pattern of progressive neurodegeneration have been associated with unstable trinucleotide repeats. This review summarizes the research on anticipation in bipolar disorder and other secular trends in the patterns of the illness such as the cohort effect. The changing nature of bipolar disorder is likely to be a result of combined influences from several genes, some of which are likely to be in a state of flux, as well as environmental or cultural forces that converge to give the clinical picture of anticipation."}, {"Title": "Functional neuroimaging in neurology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "How can functional neuroimaging be applied to clinical neurology and psychiatry? This article reviews selected contributions of functional neuroimaging to the clinical neurosciences. We review selected technical aspects of positron emission tomography, single photon emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging with a focus on the relative strengths and weaknesses of these techniques. Consumers of functional neuroimaging research are encouraged to consider the limitations of imaging techniques and theoretical pitfalls of cognitive task design when interpreting results of functional imaging studies. Then, we selectively review the contributions of functional neuroimaging to neurology and psychiatry, including the areas of epilepsy, stroke, chronic pain, schizophrenia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Future directions of functional neuroimaging research are offered, with the emphasis that the best conclusions are informed by a convergence of research from functional neuroimaging, neurophysiological, and lesion studies."}, {"Title": "Principles of structured data entry applied to reference sources.", "Abstract": "Our Structured Data Entry application makes use of a domain specific data model. The principles governing the modeling of this data model, are similar to the requirements of the criteria underlying taxonomic systems. Using the DSM-IV as reference source to create a data model for psychiatry, revealed a number of flaws in the criteria of this system, which potentially influence the reliability and validity of this taxonomic system. We conclude that the modeling process provides us with a powerful tool which can be used during the revision process of such systems."}, {"Title": "Interactions of staff and residents with pharmaceutical industry: a survey of psychiatric training program policies.", "Abstract": "In response to perceived controversies regarding interactions between physicians and the pharmaceutical industry, we undertook a study to look at the relationship between Canadian psychiatry training programs and the pharmaceutical industry.\nThe authors distributed a survey to the residency program directors and chief residents of the 16 psychiatry training programs in Canada.\nOf respondents, 75 per cent were either unaware of or noted an absence of policies or guidelines regarding interactions with the pharmaceutical industry in their training programs; 70 per cent viewed staff psychiatrists and residents to be at least 50 per cent familiar with the Canadian Medical Association's policy summary; and 74 per cent were unaware of any structural teaching regarding potential conflicts of interest between psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry. A significant number of respondents perceived occasional excessive influence by the pharmaceutical industry on residents' training.\nDespite concerns about potential conflicts of interest, there are a few guidelines in most psychiatry training programs in Canada regarding the relationship between physicians and the pharmaceutical industry."}, {"Title": "Stereoisomers in Psychiatry: The Case of Escitalopram.", "Abstract": "Many medications in common clinical use consist of \"mirror image\" isomers that differ only in the direction in which they rotate plane-polarized light. These stereoisomers exist as mixtures of \"right\" and \"left\" handed molecules that are the product of chemical syntheses. However, the biochemical milieu of the human body is a highly stereospecific environment where the fit of medication and receptor may depend on the shape of the molecule in 3-dimensional space. Recent advances in chemistry have allowed the more ready preparation of single isomers of various drugs that were previously available only as racemic mixtures. For those compounds in which the isomers differ in stereospecificity, this separation into single isomers can result in significant changes in potency, tolerability, and efficacy. This article reviews some basic information about stereochemistry and describes the development of a new single isomer antidepressant, escitalopram, which is one of the components of the widely used selective serotonin uptake inhibitor citalopram."}, {"Title": "NIH State-of-the-Science Statement on symptom management in cancer: pain, depression, and fatigue.", "Abstract": "To provide health care providers, patients, and the general public with a responsible assessment of currently available data regarding management of cancer symptoms such as pain, depression, and fatigue.\nA non-Federal, non-advocate, 13-member panel representing the fields of psychiatry, nursing, social work, medical oncology, pediatric oncology, epidemiology, pharmacology, radiation oncology, and the public. In addition, experts in these same fields presented data to the panel and to a conference audience of approximately 300.\nPresentations by experts; a systematic review of the medical literature provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; and an extensive bibliography of cancer symptom management research papers, prepared by the National Library of Medicine. Scientific evidence was given precedence over clinical anecdotal experience.\nAnswering predefined questions, the panel drafted a statement based on the scientific evidence presented in open forum and the scientific literature. The draft statement was read in its entirety on the final day of the conference and circulated to the audience for comment. The panel then met in executive session to consider the comments received and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The statement was made available on the World Wide Web at http://consensus.nih.gov immediately after the conference. This statement is an independent report of the panel and is not a policy statement of the NIH or the Federal Government.\nToo many cancer patients with pain, depression, and fatigue receive inadequate treatment for their symptoms. Clinicians should use brief assessment tools routinely to ask patients about pain, depression, and fatigue and to initiate evidence-based treatments. Current evidence to support the concept of cancer symptom clusters is insufficient, and additional theoretically driven research is warranted. Research is needed on the definition, occurrence, assessment, and treatment of pain, depression, and fatigue alone and together through adequately funded prospective studies. Fear of cancer and its consequences must be ameliorated. All patients with cancer should have optimal symptom control from diagnosis throughout the course of illness, irrespective of personal and cultural characteristics. The state of the science in cancer symptom management should be reassessed periodically."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric disturbances and psychotropic drugs in tinnitus patients.", "Abstract": "At the ear, nose, and throat clinic of the Third Medical Faculty at Charles University and at the Psychiatry Department of the Institute for Further Education of Physicians in Prague, we examined 25 patients with tinnitus accompanied by psychiatric disturbances and followed them up for at least 6 months. Psychological changes in tinnitus patients occur in a characteristic chronological succession and manifest in three stages: defense, the search for adaptive mechanism, and relative recovery or a development of psychiatric disturbance (or both). Some psychotropic drugs probably diminish tinnitus by the mechanism of improving general psychiatric comfort and direct central influence. Subjective heaviness of tinnitus is defined by the authors as all the difficulties that exist along with tinnitus. It encompasses subjective evaluation of tinnitus loudness, frequency of tinnitus episodes, and psychiatric disturbances arising from the individual discomfort caused by tinnitus. The authors selected the visual analog scale as an easily used instrument appropriate for the complex evaluation of subjective heaviness of tinnitus."}, {"Title": "Computerized ultrasonographic craniocorpography and abnormal psychomotor activity in psychiatric patients.", "Abstract": "A new version of craniocorpography (CCG), called computerized ultrasonographic CCG (Comp-USCCG), has been clinically applied for objective recording, documentation, and quantitative evaluation of abnormal psychomotor activity in psychiatric patients. Implications of this completely new approach to psychopathology are discussed. An original representation of Comp-USCCG data (introducing the time dimension as a new CCG parameter) is used to illustrate better the atypical abnormal stepping Comp-USCCG movement patterns in psychotic patients, some of which have not been described in neurootological patients to date. These atypical abnormal stepping Comp-USCCG movement patterns are prolonged longitudinal or shortened or backward longitudinal displacement; dysrhythmic longitudinal or lateral sway; and longitudinal or lateral directional changes. Reflecting the abnormal psychomotor activity, Comp-USCCG also provides for possible indirect evaluation of the underlying subjective psychotic experience. The contribution of the approach could be defined as an application of a known neurootological method into a new field of medicine (psychiatry) with a new purpose (to record and measure abnormal psychomotor activity). Our conclusion is that Comp-USCCG could become the first objective and quantitative method available for use in the field of clinical psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Attitude of Arabian Gulf University medical students towards psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The attitude of medical students towards psychiatry has been studied extensively in the developed world. The inability to attract medical students to specialize in psychiatry has always been a serious challenge to psychiatric recruitment.\nThis study evaluates the attitude of medical students towards psychiatry and identifies associated factors.\nMedical students from years 1, 4 and 7 at the College of Medicine and Medical Sciences (CMMS), Arabian Gulf University (AGU), constituted the study sample. One hundred and twenty two (87.1%) medical students completed the Attitude Towards Psychiatry-30 (ATP-30) scale and the study questionnaire.\nThe attitude towards psychiatry was moderately positive (mean ATP score = 105.79, SD = 13.34). Twenty two (15.7%) students selected psychiatry as one of the top three career choices. Fifty five (72.3%) of the pre-clinical students agreed that teaching at the college is good or acceptable, compared to 11 students (44%) from the clinical phase. Female, younger and junior students had more positive attitudes than male, older and senior students. Factors such as exposure to material related to psychiatry, having a close relation with psychiatric illness and having a romantic relationship with a psychiatric patient were significantly related to the ATP score.\nThe results of the study did not support the hypothesis that the greater the exposure to psychiatry, the higher the ATP. Possible explanations for the low attraction of graduates to psychiatry in spite of the initial high ATP and ways to overcome this problem are discussed."}, {"Title": "Introducing psychosocial and psychiatric concepts to first year medical students using an integrated, biopsychosocial framework.", "Abstract": "The main objective of the problem-based teaching unit reported in this paper was to introduce psychosocial and psychiatric concepts to first year medical students using an integrated approach.\nA total of 131 undergraduate students studied a case of delirium. Students were encouraged to understand the problem from a number of perspectives and approaches. In particular, the patient's view was emphasised. This was partially achieved by employing a standardised patient, who answered students' questions about what it was like to be unwell and hospitalised. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the teaching project were conducted.\nOverall, the teaching project was well received. However, as an introduction to a complex and unfamiliar area, students were concerned that material was difficult to grasp.\nAs a foundation for future teaching in psychiatry, the case and our methods appear appropriate.

Self-poisoning with paracetamol was the most common means, with overdoses of anti-depressants becoming more frequent. Changes to paracetamol pack size regulations in 1997 have been followed by a reduction in overdoses, and there has been more prescription of anti-depressants less likely to necessitate hospitalization if overdosed. Improved liaison psychiatry services and increased levels of employment are among the factors that would suggest an impact on hospital admissions for self-harm. This study analysed DSH admissions to hospitals in England from 1995/96 to 1999/2000 to examine changes.\nA retrospective analysis of the Hospital Episode Statistics database was carried out.\nHospital admissions for DSH rose to 153 per 100000 in 1997/98, then declined to 143 per 100000 in 1999/2000. Paracetamol overdoses decreased from 77 to 67 per 100000. The use of anti-depressants or tranquillizers grew from 56 to 75 per 100000 during the 5 years. Self-injury, narcotics overdoses and the use of alcohol continued to increase over time.\nYearly increases in admissions for DSH to hospitals in England reversed in 1998/99 and stabilized in 1999/ 2000. These changes were most noticeable for the 16-24 years age group. The use of paracetamol decreased, whereas other means of self-harm increased. Regional differences and the relationship between rates of DSH in the community and hospital should be explored further."}, {"Title": "Individual vulnerability to substance abuse and affective disorders: role of early environmental influences.", "Abstract": "One of the most important questions raised by modern psychiatry and experimental psychopathology is the origin of mental diseases. More concisely, clinical and experimental neurosciences are increasingly concerned with the factors that render one individual more vulnerable than another to a given pathological outcome. Animal models are now available to understand the sources of individual differences for specific phenotypes prone to behavioral disadaptations. Over the last 10 years we have explored the consequences of environmental perinatal manipulations in the rat. We have shown that prenatal stress is at the origin of a wide range of physiological and behavioral aberrances such as alterations in the activity of the hormonal stress axis, increased vulnerability to drug of abuse, emotional liability, cognitive impairments and predisposition to pathological aging. Taken together, these abnormalities define a bio-behavioral syndrome. Furthermore, the cognitive disabilities observed in prenatally-stressed rats were recently related to an alteration of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, thus confirming the impact of early life events on brain morphology. A second model (handling model) has also been developed in which pups are briefly separated from their mothers during early postnatal life. In contrast with prenatally-stressed animals, handled rats exhibited a reduced emotion response when confronted with novel situations and were protected against age-induced impairments of both the hormonal stress axis and cognitive functions. Taken together, the results of these investigations show that the bio-behavioral phenotype that characterizes each individual is strongly linked to the nature and timing of perinatal experience. Furthermore, data collected in prenatally-stressed animals indicate that this model could be used profitably to understand the etiology and pathophysiology of affective disorders."}, {"Title": "Toward a European harmonization of psychiatric training: the prospects of residency training in Greece.", "Abstract": "The establishment of the European Union increased the need for uniformity of provision of medical care and medical education in European countries.

Most program directors (73%) agreed that sleep medicine was a viable career option for graduating psychiatric residents. Nonetheless, few recent psychiatry graduates have entered the field. Fewer psychiatric residency programs offer sleep electives than in the past, although most still provide didactics.

Forensic psychiatry is being very much felt an important part of crime and criminology and is being thoroughly neglected. We cannot ignore the mental status of a person in relation to commission of a crime as it is the case in all spheres of life. So updating forensic psychiatry in educational programme may play key roles in crime investigations.

In general medicinal understanding, placebo means the subjective feeling of a positive effect in response to something that is used for curative intentions. In spite of difficulties in its definition and unknown content, its existence is generally accepted. What is discussed is its level of effectiveness in any disorder and medication. The placebo effect varies not only among diseases but also among regions and countries. Even the physicians' belief in a placebo increases its effect. Another interesting point about the placebo is its side effects. In many placebo controlled studies, the side effects of the placebo are found to be greater than those of real drugs. Different from other diseases, psychiatric disorders have strong connections with the placebo effect. The results of many studies support this idea. The increasing importance of placebos in psychiatry is really an interesting subject. For some people, the reason for this is hidden in the nature of psychiatric diseases. However, nonpharmacologic placebos such as \"inspiration\", \"convincing\", \"confidence\", and \"belief\" are believed to play a central role in psychiatry. In this article, placebo (the placebo effect) is defined, the implications of placebo in general medicine or psychiatry are discussed, and specific or nonspecific treatment methods are explained. The effects of a placebo on both the patient and the physician are emphasized. The significance of the placebo effect in psychiatry is also mentioned; and a new point of view, based upon the importance of symbolization and satisfaction is introduced in treatment and related action mechanisms."}, {"Title": "[Cognitive and emotional factors in major depression and suicide].", "Abstract": "Suicide is defined as ending ones life with his own will.

A biographical part is dedicated to the personal and professional development of the son of a family of train drivers from Appenzell, who, after studying medicine in Zurich, became the founder of the child and youth psychiatric service in the Canton of Zurich. A detailed report is given on the formation of the child an youth psychiatric service in the Canton of Zurich over almost 40 years. It begins in 1929, when med. prakt. Jakob Lutz took over management of the Stephansburg, the first observation unit for child psychiatry in Switzerland, and ends in 1968, when he retired, after becoming Director of the service an both extraordinary professor and honorary professor for child an youth psychiatry. Discussions on different forms of therapy in child an youth psychiatry include ideas on the therapeutic activity of Jakob Lutz himself and his demands on the personality and training of therapist in child and youth psychiatry. The chapter on child schizophrenia, autism and mentally handicapped children deals with special patient groups.

These were compared, in certain aspects, with those of the patients seen in psychiatric hospital located within the same city.\nThe rate of referral to the C-L service was 0.4% of all hospital admission and outpatient referrals. A major reason for referral was psychiatric comorbidity (80.5%). Other reasons include social problems, neurological conditions such as epilepsy and migraine. About fifty-four percent of the patients were referred to the C-L psychiatric service by internists. The mean age of the patients seen on this service was 31.1 (SD 13.1) years, while those of psychiatric hospital patients were 32.6 (SD14.5) (inpatients) and 33.2 (SD13.9) years (outpatients). A majority of C-L patients were female and of Indian descent, while the psychiatric hospital patients were predominantly males with more indigenous Fijian inpatients but more Indian outpatients. The most common psychiatric disorders in the C-L service were depressive episode/recurrent depressive disorder (29.9%), and neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (25.7%). The most common psychiatric disorders encountered in the psychiatric hospital were schizophrenia/delusional disorders (58.5% for inpatients and 52.7% for outpatients) and bipolar affective disorders (30.6% for inpatients and 27.9% for outpatients).\nThe most likely person to utilize the C-L service in this population is a young adult female Indian who has been suffering from an internal medical condition, which became complicated by depression, resulting in the attending physician seeking psychiatric opinion.

Although the reaction to his intervention was mixed, Moniz was awarded the Nobel Price for his work in 1949. The present article concentrates on both the Portuguese and the international perception of Moniz' lobotomy and its apparent ethical implications. One particularly important question that Moniz's work brings to the fore concerns the role of psychosurgery in contemporary psychiatry and--consequently--the role of the spirit of the age in judging psychosurgical interventions.

It was determined by two important events--the constitution of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918, and the foundation of the Faculty of Medicine of Comenius University in Bratislava in 1919. In the new state, for the first time in their history, the Slovaks were given the access to national university education and the opportunity to develop science in Slovakia. The history of the first Department of Neurology of the Faculty of Medicine of Comenius University as well as neurology in Slovakia started on September 21, 1919 and was assigned to prof. MUDr. Zden\u0115k Myslivecek, a professor of psychiatry and neurology. The further heads of this department were prof. MUDr. Miroslav Kriv\u00fd, prof. MUDr. Stanislav Kr\u00e1kora. They devoted their scientific work to the problems of neuropathology, neurohistology, etc. Their department successors, professors Karol Matulay and Jozef Cern\u00e1cek were Slovak physicians. Prof. Cern\u00e1cek focused his work on the problems of neuroinfection, its resulting conditions and the dominance and interaction of the hemispheres. Prof. Matulay devoted his attention to epileptology and rehabilitation in psychiatry. Owing to their merit the neurological clinics engaged experts that were starting to grow in Slovakia, who were educated at the Faculty of Medicine in Bratislava.

RESONS FOR THE STUDY: RISK ASSESSMENT: A re-admission to a high-security setting may be the result of a failed risk assessment at the time of discharge. An analysis of re-admissions might reveal facts that will improve risk prediction. In this context every re-admission to maximum security should qualify for critical incident appraisal. A re-admission could also indicate prudent risk management where the patient is readmitted prior to the occurrence of any new incident. Our analysis may give an indication how risk prediction and risk management is functioning in the Forensic Psychiatry setting.\nPatient numbers at the State Hospital have exceeded planning predictions. In the early 1990s the prediction was that numbers would level off at around 200 patients. Instead admission rates continued to rise and the State Hospital in-patient population has on occasion reached its maximum. This trend has continued throughout the decade with the daily patient numbers averaging 236, 248, 252 and 249 in the last four years (1997-2000). In this context the role played by re-admissions is an important health economics issue.\nData gathered from the medical records department and examination of medical case files, entered into a database, and subsequently analysed using a variety of tools. Descriptive statistics for the total State Hospital patient population between 1992-1994 were taken from a published survey. Other comparative analyses were undertaken using data from previously published studies.\nThe data originate from the State Hospital, Carstairs, Lanarkshire, which is the only psychiatric hospital in Scotland to offer maximum-security care. Patients are admitted from ordinary psychiatric hospitals as well as from a penal setting. The maximum number of staffed beds is currently 257. These comprise an admission unit, two rehabilitation units including one with flatlet accommodation, a specialist learning difficulties unit, an all female unit and six male wards. The Hospital is staffed by psychiatrists, GPs, psychologists, social workers, psychiatric nurses including nurse specialists, occupational therapists, and other specialist staff employed in the education, occupations and recreation departments.\nAnnual re-admission rate, averaged over 1992-1997 is 22.3% of all patient discharges in the hospital. This is broadly in line with other studies quoted in the literature. The re-admission rate co-varied with first admission rate at an almost constant ratio of 0.38 over the six-year period of study. There is no apparent systematic reason for this phenomenon. The most apparent risk factor was a previous admission to the State Hospital of less than a years duration. Compared with the current average length of stay of five years, this must be considered a short admission. Patients with an above average length of stay were rarely readmitted. Most re-admissions returned during the first year after discharge and nearly all had returned within a three-year period. State patients on a Restriction Order who will be subject to conditional discharge with ongoing supervision fared best and were least likely to be re-admitted. However such patients are also likely to have an above average length of stay. Convicted prisoners and remanded offenders were most likely to be readmitted. There was almost no crossover between the civil and criminal populations when their status was reviewed on re-admission. This raises the question, whether these two patient groups should be perceived and managed differently. The recent move to build medium secure units in Scotland, such as the Orchard Clinic in Edinburgh, now makes this a practical option. This finding also suggests that, in Scotland, bed closures in Mental Hospitals are not leading to a decant of mentally disordered patients into the penal system, at least at the level of more serious offending. Violence was overall the most common reason for return to the State Hospital. Violence was the predominant reason for re-admission from a local hospital whereas relapse of symptoms, where such symptoms were associated with dangerous behaviour in the past, was rarely given as a reason. In contrast, relapse was the predominant reason for return from prison. This may be related to inadequate prison hospital facilities rather than good risk prediction."}, {"Title": "[Follow-up study of quality of life and treatment of eating disorder: dynamics of the depressive and anxiety symptoms].", "Abstract": "A group of 56 female patients with eating disorders (36 anorexic and 20 bulimic) aged 16-48 (average 23.9) was studied. According to DSM-IV and ICD-10 among anorectic 8 (14.3%) represented restricting type and 28 (50%)-bulimic type, among bulimic-12 (21.4%)-purging type and 8 (14.3%)-nonpurging type. They were treated average 21.5 months in the I Department of Psychiatry Medical University of Gdansk (some of them were outpatients) between 1995-2000. Duration of disorders was 4 months-10 years (X +/- SD33.8 +/- 28.6 months). Follow-up period lasted from 4 months to 2 years. All patients were examined twice time (before and after treatment) with the following methods: Structured Questionnaire, Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), PIL by Crumbaugh and Maholick, Spielberger Self-Evaluation Questionnaire. The aim of our examination was to define changes in the state of patients after complex treatment (pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy) and important parameters of quality of life in our groups. After complex treatment (pharmacotherapy, individual and group psychotherapy) which lasted average 21.5 months we observed significant improvement of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Pharmacotherapy included tricyclic antidepressants (55.4%), tetracyclic antidepressants (10.7%), SSRI (44.6%), neuroleptics (10.7%), carbamazepine (32.1%). Some patients were treated more than one medicine. We received high correlation between ideal weight and weight after treatment. Therefore we supposed that our complex therapy was effective and improved approval of self-image and weight. Significance of life after treatment depended on intensity of depression in BDI and intensity of anxiety as state. The long lasting complex therapy significantly lowered depressive and anxiety symptoms (in subjective and objective aspects) in our group of patients with eating disorders."}, {"Title": "[Carbamazepine in the treatment in psychiatric disorders based on retrospective clinical study].", "Abstract": "Medical records of patient treated in I Department of Psychiatry Medical University of Gdansk in 1996-2000 were analysed.

Its primary aim was to introduce Morita therapy and the amae psychology to participants from abroad, not as something exotic, but as something intrinsically relevant to them. In my opinion, Morita therapy is based upon Morita's discovery that certain neurotics, whom he eventually named as shinkeishitsu, can recover spontaneously from severe anxiety when placed in isolation and forced to rest in bed without any diversion under the doctor's strict supervision. In other words, only those patients who follow the doctor's advice faithfully through initial isolation and subsequent work-stages can benefit from Morita therapy. It is further argued that it does not do justice to Morita to speculate that he developed his theory and therapy under the influence of Zen. Apropos of the amae psychology what is most noteworthy about it is that its genuine feeling can be conveyed only nonverbally unlike love which one can express verbally when one says \"I love you\". It is understood that ambivalence refers to the co-existence of love and hate. This love, however, had better be called amae since it is usually nonverbal and not even acknowledged. Narcissism also entails amae, in fact amae turned upon itself, because narcissism consists in denying one's virtual dependence. Interestingly, the word amae alone may suggest a narcissistic state when it is used in the sense of self-indulgence, the usage which is now becoming quite common. Apart from elucidating two psychiatric terms, the concept of amae turns out to be quite handy in describing what transpires in the psychotherapeutic situation including that of Morita therapy. The concluding remark is to emphasize the importance of psychological concepts against the prevailing view of evidence-based psychiatry. It is argued that the objectivity of scientific findings is in the final analysis a postulate guaranteed by the conscience of individual scientists. If so, the same kind of objectivity may be attributed to the observations made by the doctor when he maintains the psychotherapeutic relationship against all odds and also without any compromise of his conscience."}, {"Title": "[Roles of brain science in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "At the opportunity of celebrating the 100th Anniversary of the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology, I am filled with deep emotion when I recall the time only a few decades ago, when mental disorders were believed to be an illness of the mind without any disorder in the brain. It has now become apparent that a mental disease emerges from the malfunction of the brain's unique biological mechanisms, so that any mental disease can be cured or prevented if the cause of the malfunction is clarified. Analyses of intercellular as well as intracellular signal transduction and the mechanisms underlying gene regulation in brain cells have recently advanced markedly and have brought a marked improvement in the methods and technology for investigating pathogenesis of neurological and psychiatric diseases. These impressive results have been derived in the search for the cause of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and spinocerebellar degeneration. Certain minor changes in the molecular structure of sodium channels have been found to cause epilepsy. It has also been revealed that ten particular sites in chromosomes harbor the remote cause of schizophrenia and depression. These sites are probably responsible for production of certain synaptic transmitters and modulators. Another major challenge in the field of psychiatry is to understand the unique symptoms exhibited by patients with psychiatric disorders, which requires research to head in a direction different from molecular and cellular brain science. It is a challenge similar to the very fundamental challenge of determining how our brain, which is composed of numerous brain cells, yields our mind (or, should I say, supports our mind). To understand the brain as a complex system is more difficult than researching its molecular and cellular machinery, and accordingly, the progress of research in this field has been slow. However, it is gradually gaining speed thanks to the improvement in non-invasive methods for measuring activities in conscious human brains as well as that to the establishment of computational models. For example, it is a major mystery why a schizophrenic patient experiences auditory hallucinations, but an interesting hypothesis is derived by considering activities of the thinking brain as a neural system. Under this hypothesis, we gather information from the outside world by using our sensory systems and establish its internal model in our brain. Thus, manipulation of the internal model to run a simulation is an important part of our thinking activities. When an internal model behaves abnormally, abnormal information is generated, which makes the patient mistake it for sound from the outside, thus causing auditory hallucinations. It is highly expected that substantial progress will be made in psychiatry through proposals of new hypothetical models such as this one as well as verification of them through non-invasive measurement of brain activities. In the near future, patients with mental disorders will most likely benefit from the results of this two-directional research in psychiatry. The expectation is high for the strong leadership of the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology to promote research in Japan. Effective research effort requires efficient collection of human materials and systematic survey of patients, which will inevitably increase the involvement of patients in basic research. Improvement of research environments such as by developing a method for assessing research ethics and upgrading brain banks is urgently needed."}, {"Title": "Two registers of madness in Enlightenment Britain. Part 1.", "Abstract": "Part 1 of this essay argues that in Augustan and Georgian England it was widely understood that madness could have two more-or-less distinct meanings. 'Moral' madness was the subject's own fault, and he/she remained accountable for actions commissioned under its effects. The delusional ideas arose in the mind, and by definition remained within the moral province of the individual. By contrast, in 'real' madness, the sufferer was the passive recipient of body-based sickness, and he/she was understood to be innocent, but paid for this exculpation of moral accountability by surrendering full personhood. Part 2 of the essay examines how Georgian churchmen viewed madness, and then returns to psychiatry proper for a closer look at how certain theories of madness were inflected by the problematics of insanity's conflicting meanings. Finally, a previously unrecognized Georgian psychiatric therapy, 'classical moral treatment', is described and put in the context of the better-known Tukean 'moral treatment'."}, {"Title": "[Neural areas of emotions in normal and brain pathology assessed by functional neuroimaging methods].", "Abstract": "The investigation into neural back-ground of emotions in normal and brain pathology using functional brain imaging techniques (fMRI, PET, SPECT) remains one of the most interesting scientific challenges in the area of psychiatry.

Bleuler regularly prepared forensic criminal expert's reports himself until emeritus status was conferred on him in 1927. Analysis of his writings indicates that his position remained explicitly deterministic. In Bleuler's later work, that position was integrated into the natural philosophy vitalistic theory of mnemism, itself part of a more comprehensive theory, without any corrections to its content. Eugen Bleuler always remained a critic of criminal law, although it can be seen from later expert's reports that he for the most part accepted the existing system for the administration of justice for practical reasons. However, Bleuler always defended the idea that punishment should not be based on the moral guilt of the perpetrator but rather on the prospect of curing him."}, {"Title": "Forced normalization at the interface between epilepsy and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In 1953, Landolt described a group of patients with poorly controlled epilepsy who had psychotic episodes associated with remission of their seizures and disappearance of epileptiform activity on their EEGs.

The importance of child and adolescent psychiatry has never been more profound, but our country, without a chair in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the medical school framework, and lacking recognition of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry as a clinical department has undoubtedly become an underdeveloped country in terms of child and adolescent psychiatric care. The medical schools have been in the process of review and reorganization these past few years. The range of mental science is wide, and despite being a major discipline constituting one of the two arms of medical science together with somatic medicine, it is regarded as a minor existence in our country. This is the time to re-establish mental science, with areas such as child and adolescent psychiatry, geriatric psychiatry, social psychiatry, and crime psychiatry placed on an equal footing with general psychiatry. Turning our eyes on the world, the children are being robbed of their mental health as refugees, through child labor, starvation, and civil war.

The psycho-oncological team may be integrated in the oncology unit or autonomous. A network organisation is still uncommon. The intervention of external units of psychiatry, not specialised in oncology, is a less satisfying solution. Actually, 25% of the 94 French centres have neither psychiatrist nor psychologist.

Thereafter, appropriate ancillary testing can provide support for a specific clinical diagnosis. The spectrum of childhood sleep disorders includes OSA, narcolepsy, RLS/PLMD, sleep onset association disorder, and parasomnias. Diagnosing sleep disorders in children remains a challenge; however, a multidisciplinary approach may provide an opportunity for productive collaboration and, thereby, more effective patient management.

Although suicide in cancer patients and appropriate management of cancer patients with suicidality are critical issues in clinical oncology practice, there have been very few studies to understand suicidality in cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to explore the clinical factors associated with suicidality in Japanese patients with cancer.\nWe investigated the clinical factors associated with suicidality in cancer patients by analyzing the consultation data of patients referred to the Psychiatry Division, National Cancer Centre Hospital and Hospital East, Japan.\nOf 1713 psychiatric referrals, 62 (3.6%) were related to suicidality, including 44 cases with suicidal ideation, 10 suicide attempts and eight cases who had requested euthanasia and/or continuous sedation. Most of the patients suffered from physical distress and/or psychiatric disorders. The results of a multivariate analysis comparing cancer patients with a psychiatric referral related to suicidality and those referred for other reasons indicated that impaired physical functioning and major depression were significant associated factors.\nOur findings suggest that early detection and appropriate management of major depression and comprehensive care improving physical functioning may help to prevent suicide and manage suicidality in Japanese cancer patients."}, {"Title": "[Lifetime achievements of Ljubodrag T.

Mihailovitsh entered the University School of Medicine in Belgrade in 1945/46 and finished the studies in 1951. During the studies he was one of the highly esteemed students and social-political workers. He was appointed physician at the Institute of Pathologic Physiology of the University School of Medicine in Belgrade in January 1952 where he started his research-work managed by professor Shahovitsh. At that time he spent half of his working hours at the Department of Neuro-psychiatry of the University School of Medicine in Belgrade managed by professor V. Vujitsh where he completed his knowledge in clinical neurology. In 1954 he was elected assistant lecturer, in 1958 senior lecturer, in 1964 associate professor, and in this rank he died. His remarkable working capability and brilliant intelligence became evident soon after the beginning of his duties at the Institute of Pathologic Physiology of the University School of Medine in Belgrade. In 1954 he went to Yale University in the USA for advanced, specialized training in the field of nerophysiology and neropathophysiology in the laboratory of professor P.J. Fulton.

In the first part of the presentation, basic assumptions of pharmaco-EEG relevant to the topic of the prediction of clinical response to antipsychotic treatment are summarized. The first step in the approach to this topic is the characterization of the quantitative EEG (QEEG) profile of the investigated drug. This is generally accomplished by assessing QEEG changes induced by a single dose of the same drug to groups of healthy subjects (test dose procedure). The prediction of patient responsiveness to a specific drug is based on the assessment of the similarity of their QEEG profile to the drug characteristic profile. In the second part of the presentation, main findings concerning QEEG changes induced by the acute administration of standard neuroleptics or novel antipsychotics in healthy subjects and in patients with schizophrenia are described.

This study focuses on contemporary descriptions of susto and uses a cross-cultural, comparative design to describe susto in three diverse Latino populations. Mestizo/ladino populations were interviewed in Guatemala, Mexico, and south Texas. An initial set of open-ended interviews was conducted with a sample of \"key\" informants at each site to obtain descriptive information about susto. A structured interview protocol was developed for use at all three sites, incorporating information from those initial interviews. A second set of structured interviews was then conducted with a representative sample at each site.

The general practitioner's role is situated on two levels: in a preliminary stage, the early identification of risk, and in a secondary stage, the provision of care at the time of a suicide attempt and then the provision of on-going follow-up care in partnership with other special services. The study aimed at evaluating general practitioners' practices when encountered with suicidal patients and assessing their management of suicidal behaviour, as well as difficulties met and their expectations. Responses to a questionnaire were received from 290 general practitioners in one regional department in France. The results revealed that two-thirds of the respondents considered the identification of suicidal tendencies as being difficult, in particular with regard to the detection of young people at risk. General hospitals are the most common structures where patients are referred to in the event of a suicide attempt, as a facility that is permanently open and capable of delivering ambulatory care. A majority of the general practitioners expressed the need for training which was focused on methods for the early identification of risk as well as the development of listening skills."}, {"Title": "Clinical use of quetiapine in disease states other than schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Although quetiapine was introduced as an atypical antipsychotic drug with clinical efficacy in schizophrenia patients, it has been used in a variety of disease states over the last 5 years. The most common conditions have included mood and anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, aggression, hostility, posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, delirium, and comorbid substance abuse. Considering its efficacy in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric conditions and its excellent tolerability profile, quetiapine could emerge as a broad-spectrum psychotropic medication that may be helpful in psychiatry across various diagnostic categories. Traditionally, studies on the predictive validity of psychiatric disorders help with nosologic issues and controversies. Assessing quetiapine's tolerability and its overall treatment response might help tease out the predictive validity of various psychiatric syndromes (based currently on an atheoretical descriptive approach) and may shape psychiatric nosology in the future. Quetiapine's low affinity and fast dissociation from postsynaptic dopamine-2 receptors give the least risk of producing acute extrapyramidal side effects, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. These factors suggest that the clinical utility of quetiapine in psychiatric conditions other than schizophrenia has not been fully exploited thus far."}, {"Title": "[The founder of the first therapeutic community in Norwegian psychiatry].", "Abstract": "In 1959, Dr. Herluf Thomstad (1905-2000) started the first therapeutic community in Norway at Ullev\u00e5l University Hospital.

The global prevalence of ED is estimated to affect about 10%, but has been found to increase significantly with age (39% in men 40 years of age and 67% at 70 years of age). In men aged 40 to 70 years, the severe ED prevalence increased of three folds, 5 to 15%. In order to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of sildenafil, it was conducted a national open, multicentre study on a portuguese population affected by ED. Subjects under ambulatory treatment were recruited in Psychiatry/Sexology Clinical units and Urology/Andrology. The results of the study carried out on a group of 62 men with ED, demonstrate that sildenafil was effective in the recovering of erectile function, increasing the number of attempts to sexual activity and improving their success rates (mainly in severe dysfunction). Fifty one patients treated with sildenafil, at the end of the study referred a global improvement in their erections (92.2%). Doses of 50 mg and 100 mg sildenafil were used and were well tolerated and also effective in the treatment of this pathology (70% and 69% respectively). Being this study a flexible dose one and taking into consideration that the final dose used was found the more suitable to the patients, can be concluded that 43.1% of the patients elected dose of 50 mg whereas 56.9% elected the maximum prescribed dose of 100 mg. Over and above global efficacy experimented by patients, a significant improvement in the sexual activity with partners was occurred. These results make possible a final conclusion--in the studied patients group affected by Erectile Dysfunction, aside from associated somatic pathology, sildenafil use provided a remarkable clinical profit, in what concerns global efficacy, by erectile function mechanisms improvement, concerning patients sensitivity of improvement, occurring in the major part of them, being these of high importance to the lifting up of their self-esteem."}, {"Title": "Obsessive-compulsive-bipolar comorbidity: a systematic exploration of clinical features and treatment outcome.", "Abstract": "Notwithstanding the emerging literature on comorbidity between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and bipolar disorder, relatively few systematic data exist on the clinical characteristics of this interface and its treatment. The aim of the present study is to address this challenge as it appears in a setting of routine clinical practice.\nThe sample comprised 68 patients with comorbid DSM-IV diagnoses of OCD and major depressive episode admitted and treated at the day-hospital in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pisa (Pisa, Italy) during a 3-year period (January 1995-December 1998). Thirty-eight patients (55.8%) showed lifetime comorbid bipolar disorder (12 [31.6%] bipolar I and 26 [68.4%] bipolar II).

Assessments of drug treatments, clinical outcome, and adverse effects were made prospectively as part of routine clinical care throughout the course of their day-hospitalization.\nIn contrast with non-bipolar OCD patients, OCD-bipolar patients showed a more episodic course with a greater number of concurrent major depressive episodes. They reported a significantly higher rate of sexual obsessions and significantly lower rate of ordering rituals. Furthermore, they reported more frequent current comorbidity with panic disorder-agoraphobia and abuse of different substances (alcohol, sedatives, nicotine, and coffee). Drug treatment with clomipramine and, to a lesser extent, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors was associated with hypomanic switches in OCD-bipolar patients, especially in those not concomitantly treated with mood stabilizers. A combination of multiple mood stabilizers was necessary in 16 OCD-bipolar patients (42.1%) and a combination of mood stabilizers with atypical antipsychotics was required in 4 cases (10.5%). OCD-bipolar patients tended to show a less positive outcome for mood symptomatology and general functioning.

This is of clinical importance mainly in patients having two non-functional alleles, phenotypically characterised as \"poor metabolisers\" (1-10% of Caucasians). Since most drugs are transformed into inactive or less active metabolites, \"poor metabolisers\" are at increased risk of developing drug induced adverse reactions.\nStudies of relevant literature (MedLine search) in addition to our own experiences, show that CYP genotyping can predict the phenotype and thereby explain some abnormal drug responses and may be used to individualize pharmacotherapy.\nAt present, CYP genotyping (CYP2C9/2C19/2D6) is most frequently requested in psychiatry and anticoagulant therapy, but the field is expanding. Important factors for implementation of pharmacogenetic methods are accuracy of diagnosis, quality of reports, response time, and cost.\nPharmacogenetic analyses will significantly contribute to reducing treatment costs for drug-induced adverse reactions and costs of sick leave, by predicting the best drug and the most effective and safest dosage. The expenses of full genotyping (CYP2C9/2C19/2D6) are equivalent to one day of sick leave.

Rejected by post-Freudian analysts as such along with the diagnosis of neurasthenia, the concept of 'actual neurosis' has survived under various theoretical schemes that seek to explain psychosomatic illness and somatisation, in general, with its concomitant poverty of affects and dearth of fantasy life. In more recent years, the concept of 'actual neurosis' has resurfaced under the label of chronic fatigue syndrome, a medical entity thought to be an immunological deficiency, while in psychoanalysis Freud's idea of a contentless mental state has been replaced by that of unconscious fantasy and symbolisation at a pre-genital or pre-verbal level."}, {"Title": "A phenomenology of closeness and its application to sexual boundary violations: a framework for therapists in training.", "Abstract": "Sexual boundary violations remain a persistent problem in psychiatry despite increased attention, disciplinary activity, and educational efforts.

Eight characteristics of ordinary psychotherapeutic engagement effectively maximize the intensity of interpersonal closeness between patient and psychotherapist while simultaneously reducing the experience of closeness outside the treatment setting for both patient and clinician. An important consequence is that drifts toward sexual boundary violations can arise from the everyday dynamics of closeness, even in the absence of individual pathology or intent. The implications for the practice of psychotherapy and personal lives of psychotherapists are explored."}, {"Title": "Treatment of depressive disorders with and without medication - a naturalistic study.", "Abstract": "Although randomized clinical trials are the standard method for comparing the efficacy of various depression treatments, the external validity and generalizability of findings obtained by this approach can be questioned for several reasons. In this naturalistic study, we compared the effectiveness of treatments conducted by psychiatrists and clinical psychologists without prescription of drugs to treatments by psychiatrists and physicians using antidepressant agents in patients with depressive disorders in a representative sample of the normal population. Our assumption was that this sample is more representative for subjects treated for depressive disorders than subjects included in controlled trials.\nIn a post hoc analysis, the health status of depressed patients under treatment for major, minor or recurrent brief depression with medication (20 patients) and without medication (30 patients), and untreated depressed subjects were compared over a one-year period using SCL-90-R depression scale scores.\nAt baseline, the two treatment groups were comparable in terms of diagnosis and severity of symptoms. Treatment effects were relatively small; patients treated with antidepressants tended to improve, whereas patients treated without drugs deteriorated slightly over one year. Seven years later, treated and untreated subjects no longer differed.\nThe results are consistent with previous studies on usual care of depressed patients showing low response rates for non-standardized treatments outside of research settings. Despite a number of methodological shortcomings (small sample size, heterogeneity of subjects and treatments, unusual rating instruments), the results presented here are unique, and provide relevant insight into usual care of depressed patients. This study underlines the importance of standardized psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in routine practice, of studies investigating the transferability of results of outcome studies across clinical populations, and of quality assurance in primary care psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Managed care's reconstruction of human existence: the triumph of technical reason.", "Abstract": "To achieve its goals of managing and restricting access to psychiatric care, managed care organizations rely on an instrument, the outpatient treatment report, that carries significant implications about how they view psychiatric patients and psychiatric care. In addition to involving ethical transgressions such as violation of patient confidentiality, denial of access to care, spurious use of concepts like quality of care, and harassment of practitioners, the managed care approach also depends on an overly technical, instrumental interpretation of human beings and psychiatric treatment. It is this grounding of managed care in technical reason that I will explore in this study. I begin with a review of a typical outpatient treatment report and show how, with its dependence on the DSM-IV, on behavioral symptoms and patient 'functioning', on the biomedical model of psychiatric illness, and on gross quantitative measures, the report results in a crude, skeletonized view of the human being as a congeries of behavioral symptoms and functions. I then develop the managed care construal of human existence further by showing its grounding in technical reason, exploring the latter in its modern embodiment and deriving it and its opposite, practical reason, from Aristotle's distinction between technical and practical reason, techne and phronesis. In this analysis of the role of technical reason in managed care, I point out that managed care did not have to develop its rationale de novo but could rather lift its arguments, e.g. the biomedical model, from contemporary psychiatry and simply apply them in a restrictive manner. Finally, I conclude this study by arguing for psychiatry's status as a discipline of practical knowledge."}, {"Title": "The concept of hebephrenia over the course of time with particular reference to the Wernicke-Kleist-Leonhard School.", "Abstract": "The concept of hebephrenia has undergone more changes than almost any other diagnostic category in clinical psychiatry. In the present article we want to outline these changes from Hecker's first description of hebephrenia to contemporary concepts mainly based on Bleuler's viewpoints. Due to rather heterogeneous and vaguely defined symptomatology, hebephrenia lost relevance as a diagnostic category in today's classification systems. As an alternative approach, Kleist and Leonhard see hebephrenias as forming distinct clinical entities with insidious beginning and a chronically progressive course leading to specific and stable residual syndromes, mainly featured by disturbed affectivity and, thus, initiative. As known up to now, hebephrenias within Leonhard's classification show poor prognosis, little response to treatment and low heredity. This concept of hebephrenia seems to be more appropriate to demarcate a homogeneous subtype which can be the subject of further promising research to clarify aetiology and nosology of schizophrenic spectrum psychoses."}, {"Title": "World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive and posttraumatic stress disorders.", "Abstract": "In this report, recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders are presented, based on available randomized, placebo- or comparator-controlled clinical studies. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line treatment for panic disorder. Tri2-cyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are equally effective, but they are less well tolerated than the SSRIs. In treatment-resistant cases, benzodiazepines like alprazolam may be used when the patient does not have a history of dependency and tolerance. Due to possible serious side effects and interactions with other drugs and food components, the irreversible monamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) phenelzine should be used only when first-line drugs have failed. In generalised anxiety disorder, venlafaxine and SSRIs can be recommended, while buspirone and imipramine may be alternatives. For social phobia, SSRIs are recommended for the first line, and MAOIs, moclobemide and benzodiazepines as second line.

A critique of the evolutionary perspective.", "Abstract": "To the evolutionary biologist human beings at every stage of their development represent 'compromises' in their continual adaptation to their changing environments. Using a neo-Darwinian perspective, evolutionary psychiatrists such as Randolph Nesse (Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Michigan) argue that while natural selection does not shape disease itself, it does shape human traits and therefore vulnerability to disease. Accordingly, for him, depression is a human emotion which may represent a surviving positive response and is therefore not always pathological. This critique examines Nesse's principal arguments and reveals a number of weaknesses in those arguments. The article concludes with a review of the therapeutic and preventive implications of his evolutionary perspective on depressive states as well as some implications for mental health nurses."}, {"Title": "Neuroreceptor imaging in psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Molecular imaging, the study of receptors, transporters and enzymes, as well as other cellular processes, has grown in recent years to be one of the most active neuroimaging areas. The application of single photon emission tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) techniques to the study of psychiatric illness has lead to increased understanding of disease processes as well as validated, in vivo, theories of illness etiology. Within the field of psychiatry these techniques have been applied most widely to the study of schizophrenia. Studies within schizophrenia are largely limited to either the dopamine or serotonin system. This is due in large part to the availability of suitable radiotracers as well as the current theories on the etiology of the illness. Two basic study designs are used when studying schizophrenia using molecular imaging and make up the majority of studies reviewed in this manuscript. The first type, termed \"clinical studies,\" compares the findings from PET and SPECT studies in those with schizophrenia to normal controls in an attempt to understand the pathophysiology of the illness. The second study design, termed \"occupancy studies,\" uses these techniques to enhance the understanding of the mechanism of action of the medications used in treating this illness. This review will focus on the findings of molecular imaging studies in schizophrenia, focusing, for the most part, on the serotonin and dopamine systems. Emphasis will be placed on how these findings and techniques are currently being used to inform the development of novel treatments for schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Commentary: eye movement research with clinical populations.", "Abstract": "The preceding set of chapters span the disciplines of neurology and psychiatry, and provide a diverse introduction to clinical eye movement research.

Part 1.", "Abstract": "Emil Kraepelin introduced the concept of dementia praecox in 1893. The eventual acceptance of the concept brought a degree of clarity and order previously unknown to psychiatric nosology. The pre-Kraepelin era had been dominated by concepts such as mania, melancholia and adolescent insanity. After Kraepelin these ideas were abandoned in favour of the two great concepts of dementia praecox and manic depressive insanity, both of which remain active within modern psychiatry in the form of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This two-part study focuses on the early British reaction to Kraepelin's concept, from 1893, when he first introduced it, to 1913 when it gained general recognition. It examines the struggle experienced by the proponents of dementia praecox before the concept's acceptance by most British psychiatrists in 1913. It argues that both clinical/professional and linguistic factors influenced the British response to dementia praecox. Part 1 of this study describes the backdrop to the development of Kraepelin's ideas and examines the response to the concept in the British psychiatric textbooks and journals of the period. Part 2 will explore reaction to the concept in the professional meetings of the period, and will also examine and evaluate the key issues arising from the debate."}, {"Title": "Two hundred years of psychiatry at Leipzig University: an overview.", "Abstract": "The University of Leipzig boasts a long tradition in the field of psychiatry. In 1811 J.C.A. Heinroth was appointed as the first professor of psychiatry in Europe. In 1877 brain researcher P. Flechsig inherited his chair, but did not significantly contribute to the progress of this speciality. His first assistant was E. Kraepelin. Flechsig's successors, O. Bumke and P.

Thoughts on psyche, mind and awareness].", "Abstract": "This paper seeks to convey an insight into the interrelationships between body, soul and mind and to show how the concept of \"soul\" has evolved through the course of history. In German the word \"soul\" has a confusing array of meanings today. For most of us it comprises all of man's emotions, his awareness, constructive thought, drive, state of mind and spirit. The soul thus represents the essence of a person and his relationships to those closest to him. For many people the soul was and still is the principle of life, the breath of life and the force of life. The immortal soul escapes, leaves the body, is weighed and judged. At all times in history man has doggedly pursued the mysteries of self-awareness, the ultimate truth and the soul. What he found varied, depending on the age and the place. What the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament express in deep-seated metaphors, the Greek philosophers put into clear-cut words: their concept of soul was then largely integrated into Christian thought. Meister Eckhart describes the soul in mystically transfigured passion. C.G. Jung writes of the \"animus and anima.\" Sigmund Freud uses the term \"psyche.\" Radical materialism denies the existence and independence of the soul's processes. The questions where we come from and where we are going, why and what for, no longer find a common answer. Psychiatry, however, takes up the intellectual call of the time and replies to the challenges of the day. Thus, the search for the \"soul\", a search that occupies so many people, also always involves the search for the whole person."}, {"Title": "Occupational psychiatry services in a military setting.", "Abstract": "Occupational psychiatry services have become increasingly important since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the recent growth of workers' compensation mental health claims.

Female patients were overrepresented in the psychiatry unit, whereas in the rehab unit more immigrants or referrals from juvenile detention were treated. Most psychiatry patients were comorbid with at least one, a quarter with more than one additional diagnosis and had less polysubstance dependence (69%). Due to a drop out rate of 71% in the patients with a criminal justice status, rehab patients did not complete treatment as often as psychiatry patients. Three years after their first dismissal and, in some cases, after several new admissions, 60% of rehabilitation clients completed the program. Both settings have their own right in the system because comorbid patients need highly individualized therapy, and rehab patients need programs able to address school-based, family-related, and gender-specific issues."}, {"Title": "[Treatment motivation, treatment satisfaction and quality of life from the viewpoint of parents at a child psychiatry facility--contribution to quality assurance].", "Abstract": "This study tried to figure out if parents initial treatment motivation influenced their final assessment of the treatment process and its outcome in child psychiatry. We evaluated parents therapy motivation by developing a questionnaire based on solution focussed therapy's conception of motivation of clients (Berg 1992). The change during the treatment in parents satisfaction with their life situations and their experience of pressure (\"life quality\")--independent from their pronounced assessment of the quality of therapy--was taken as one indication of treatment quality. In addition to this parents' assessment of treatment was investigated by a questionnaire for therapy evaluation which included process and outcome quality factors. There could be shown that significant relations existed. Therefore we are convinced that the discussion of quality assurance in child psychiatry should be enlarged with a methodical conception of therapy motivation and the assessment of life quality of parents in addition to the evaluation of their specific therapy satisfaction."}, {"Title": "Darwinian psychiatry and the concept of mental disorder.", "Abstract": "In this paper, we discuss the concept of mental disorder from the perspective of Darwinian psychiatry. Using this perspective does not resolve all of the quandaries which philosophers of medicine face when trying to provide a general definition of disease. However, it does take an important step toward clarifying why current methods of psychiatric diagnosis are criticizable and how clinicians can improve the identification of true mental disorders. According to Darwinian psychiatry, the validity of the conventional criteria of psychiatric morbidity is dependent on their association with functional impairment. Suffering, statistical deviance, and physical lesion are frequent correlates of mental disorders but, in absence of dysfunctional consequences, none of these criteria is sufficient for considering a psychological or behavioral condition as a psychiatric disorder. The Darwinian concept of mental disorder builds from two basic ideas: (1) the capacity to achieve biological goals is the best single attribute that characterizes mental health; and (2), the assessment of functional capacities cannot be properly made without consideration of the environment in which the individual lives. These two ideas reflect a concept of mental disorder that is both functional and ecological. A correct application of evolutionary knowledge should not necessarily lead to the conclusion that therapeutic intervention should be limited to conditions that jeopardize biological adaptation. Because one of the basic aims of medicine is to alleviate human suffering, an understanding of the evolutionary foundations of the concept of mental disorder should translate into more effective ways for promoting individual and social well-being, not into the search for natural laws determining what is therapeutically right or wrong."}, {"Title": "Up-regulation of neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic and bipolar patients.", "Abstract": "The delineation of dopamine dysfunction in the mentally ill has been a long-standing quest of biological psychiatry.

We demonstrate that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia and bipolar cases from the Stanley Foundation Neuropathology Consortium display significantly elevated levels of the D2 dopamine receptor desensitization regulatory protein, neuronal calcium sensor-1. These levels of neuronal calcium sensor-1 were not influenced by age, gender, hemisphere, cause of death, postmortem period, alcohol consumption, or antipsychotic and mood stabilizing medications.

This control is significantly affected by a variety of local or systemic pathologic conditions, including cancer and certain neuropathies. A potential clinical application that objectively assesses local attenuation of temperature modulation in the presence of breast cancer is described in some detail. Systemic aberrations in skin temperature modulation can be clinically useful also in neurology.

The purpose of this study is to assess quality of life and mental health of parents of referred children waiting for service at the only child psychiatric service in Iceland, with reassessment at least 3 months after first attendance to the service. In order to do so, 208 parents of 123 children waiting for psychiatric care were sent the Icelandic Quality of Life (IQL), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30) and the CAGE screen for alcoholism. For reassessment, responders in the first phase were assessed again with the IQL and GHQ-30, at least 3 months after initiation of child psychiatric interventions. A total of 120 of the 208 parents (58%) responded in the first phase of the study, 49 fathers and 71 mothers.

Nearly 55% of women compared with 26% of men were psychiatric cases, scoring 5 or higher on the GHQ. According to a CAGE score of 2 and above 16% of fathers and 14% of mother abused alcohol. No significant change occurred in parents GHQ-30 or IQL before and after initiation of treatment.

In most drug overdose cases and chemical exposures, laboratory analysis is directed toward identification and quantitation of the unchanged drug or chemical in a biologic fluid such as serum or whole blood. Specifically, most clinical laboratories routinely screen and quantitate unchanged methanol and/or ethylene glycol in suspected poisonings without toxic metabolite analysis. Martin-Amat established in 1978 that methanol associated toxicity to the optic nerve in human poisonings was due to the toxic metabolite formic acid found in methanol poisonings and not due to the direct action by unchanged methanol. Jacobsen reported in 1981 that ethylene glycol central nervous system and renal toxicity were primarily due to one acidic metabolite (glycolic acid) and not due to unchanged ethylene glycol. The first objective of this review is to describe clinical experience with formic acid and glycolic acid analysis in methanol and ethylene glycol human poisonings. Drug metabolite analysis also provides useful information in the assessment and monitoring of drug use in psychiatry and substance abusing populations. Drug analysis in substance abuse monitoring is focused on urine analysis of one or more major metabolites, and less frequently on the unchanged drug(s). Serial monitoring of the major urinary cannabinoid metabolite (delta(9)-THC-COOH) to creatinine ratios in paired urine specimens (collected at least 24 h apart) could differentiate new marijuana or hashish use from residual cannabinoid metabolite excretion in urine after drug use according to Huestis. The second objective is to demonstrate that creatinine corrected urine specimens positive for cannabinoids may help differentiate new marijuana use from the excretion of residual delta(9) -THC-COOH in chronic users of marijuana or hashish. Analysis of toxic chemical metabolites are helpful in the assessment and treatment of chemical poisoning whereas serial monitoring of urinary cannabinoid metabolites are predictive of illicit drug use in the substance abusing population."}, {"Title": "Genetic segregation analysis of alcohol and other substance-use disorders in families with recurrent, early-onset major depression.", "Abstract": "The goal of this study was to conduct a complex segregation analysis of alcohol and other substance-use disorders in families identified by probands with recurrent, early-onset major depression (RE-MDD).\nEighty-one families were identified through probands over the age of 18, who met criteria for recurrent (> or = 2 episodes), early-onset (< or = 25 years), nonpsychotic, unipolar major depression (RE-MDD) and included 407 first-degree relatives and 835 extended relatives. Psychiatric diagnoses for probands and their family members who provided blood samples were formulated from structured personal interviews, structured family history assessments, and available medical records. The remaining family members who participated and those who were deceased were evaluated through the family history method augmented by available medical records. Best estimate diagnoses were made during a consensus conference according to established diagnostic criteria. Segregation analyses were performed using the REGD routine in S.A.G.E. release 4.0.\nThe best-fitting models for the transmission of \"alcohol use disorders\" or \"alcohol/other substance use disorders\" were sex-dependent Mendelian recessive models with significant residual spousal effects. Moreover, the parameter estimates for the models were very similar for these phenotypes. In contrast, the segregation analysis of \"substance use disorder\" supported a transmissible, but non-Mendelian, major effect.\nOur results suggest that a major locus contributes to the expression of alcohol use disorders or alcohol/other substance-use disorders within families identified by probands with RE-MDD. Due to the limitations of the segregation analysis model, our results cannot address whether the same major locus is segregating across families in our sample or whether multiple major loci are involved (genetic heterogeneity).

The experimental group received a combination of psychosocial and pharmacological treatment, while the control group received the pharmacological treatment alone.\nA quasi-experimental design which included the two groups under study, experimental (n=25) and control group (n=22), was used. Both groups were assessed at the beginning and at the end of a one-year interventions considering variables such as: symptomatology, psychosocial functioning, global functioning, compliance with antipsychotic medication, relapses, rehospitalizations, therapeutic non-compliance, and adherence.\nExperimental patients, in comparison with control patients, improved their symptomatology, psychosocial functioning and global functioning considerably. They also presented the following: lower relapse frequency - 12% versus 31,8% of the controls as well as low rehospitalizacion rate - 0% versus 13.6% of the control patients, higher antipsychotic medication compliance (90%) when compared with patients under the control condition (80%), a reduced rate of therapeutic non-compliace (19.3%) and a higher degree of adherence (80.7%). On the other hand, control patients remained stabilized in their symptomatology, but did not improved in any of the psychosocial variables.\nThe results show that the combination of psychosocial and pharmacological therapy is a more effective form of treatment in comparison with the other approach of pharmacotherapy alone. It may be concluded that there is sound evidence that indicates that combined psychosocial and pharmacological therapy combined report beneficial effects for the patients; therefore, it should be considered as an important therapeutic alternative in the treatment of schizophrenic patients."}, {"Title": "[Recent topics on ethical issues in psychiatry, mental care and welfare].", "Abstract": "This lecture focuses on several ethical issues on psychiatry research and psychiatric practice. The most important issue in ethics is informed consent in both the national guidelines on ethics in genomic study and epidemiological studies determined by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labor, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. They recommend researchers to obtain consent from subjects making free voluntary decisions after they are fully provided with the necessary information and explanation. The guidelines on ethics in genomic study strongly recommend organizing an ethical committee committed by several extramural members from the fields of law, social or human sciences. On the other hand, the guidelines on ethics in epidemiological study provide how to obtain informed consent in detail according to how projects are carried out. Strict requirements of informed consent tend to inhibit medical research conduct, in particular a research on post-mortem brain, which is one of the important research areas for elucidation of pathogenesis and pathophysiology of mental disorders. Recently a new trend to organize a brain bank by donation of the patient who has given consent before death. This is a proper way to collect post-mortem brain overcoming the ethical problems and it is our hope that this trend will develop in our country. Disclosure of medical records to patients is one of the most recent and debated issues in psychiatric practices. In 1999, the Ministry of Health and Welfare started investigations on whether medical records should be disclosed to patients. The report of the committee strongly recommends accelerating the disclosure of medical records. Responding to this report, several medical organizations issued a guideline. Recently, we carried out a questionnaire survey on the disclosure rate of medical records in the psychiatric departments of both medical school hospitals and national mental hospitals, where special committees have been organized to determine the disclosure of the medical records when a patient demands it officially. Contrary to our expectation the rate of disclosure demands was very low in both medical schools and national mental hospitals.

Only a minority (11%) had overall positive feeling scores about assisting victims of IPV. While most physicians reported that it was \"significant work,\" the great majority also felt that it was difficult, low-paying, and stressful. Training in assisting victims of IPV, in medical school or afterwards, did not appear to influence feelings about assisting victims of IPV. However, physicians who were white and who were married (the majority of the respondents) were significantly more likely than the other respondents to feel negatively about providing services to victims of IPV.\nGraduate medical education and training programs need to address the association of negative feelings with helping women harmed by IPV, because these feelings may interfere with the appropriate screening, referral, and treatment of these victims."}, {"Title": "A pilot study of loading versus titration of valproate in the treatment of acute mania.", "Abstract": "This double-blind pilot study compares the effectiveness and incidence of adverse effects of oral loading versus titration schedules of valproate in acute mania.\nConsecutive new admissions for an acute manic episode were prescribed either an oral loading dose (20 mg/kg/day; n = 5; mean age = 33.4) or slower titration dose (10 mg/kg/day, n = 6. mean age = 30.6) of valproate for 7 days without other psychotropic agents. with the exception of benzodiazepines. Daily outcome measures included: serum valproic acid levels, the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS), the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) and the Adverse Effect Rating Scale.\nThe mean serum valproic acid levels were significantly higher in the loading group when compared with the titration group after 1 and 2 days following the initiation of treatment (p < 0.05). After 3 days of treatment there was a trend for the group that received the loading regimen to have slightly more improvement in YMRS scores compared with the titration group. Side-effects were minor for both treatments, however, a higher incidence of side-effects was reported in the titration group, with 50% of patients reporting sedation most likely because of increased use of benzodiazepines.\nThis suggests that a loading dose of valproate is likely safe and may provide an earlier onset of antimanic effects in patients with bipolar disorder.

Schneider as a fundamental method for psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The paper is intended to answer the question whether and to what extent the psychopathology in the direction of Karl Jaspers and Kurt Schneider is still meaningful for contemporary psychiatry. K. Schneider developed gradually his \"Clinical Psychopathology\", proceeding from Jaspers' 4th edition of the \"General Psychopathology\" (1946). The Jaspersian-Schneiderian approach, aiming more at the elucidation of the patient's own inner experiences than at the observation of behaviour, has overcome the overly objectifying psychiatry of Kraepelin. The history and bearing of Jaspersian-Schneiderian psychopathology on psychiatry, its tenets, positions and concepts, as well as findings and results obtained with the approach are outlined. Recent developments in psychiatry, underestimating or even neglecting the psychopathological approach, are in danger of resulting in a loss of psychopathological competence in research and practice. The essay shows that this psychopathology is far from over, but remains relevant for clinical and biological psychiatry and should lead now, as ever, all other special and basic sciences in psychiatry. The critical methodological reflection and the fundamental psychopathological framework, created by Jaspers and modified and adapted to the requirements of clinical psychiatry by K. Schneider, are also today practically useful and heuristically fruitful. That we need psychopathology for diagnostics, therapy and primary and secondary prevention of schizophrenic psychoses, and also for biological psychiatric research, has been demonstrated by means of a long string of contributions of the last decades. The Jaspersian-Schneiderian approach does not mean definite conclusion and codification, but leaves enough room for new developments, completing, correcting and changing many aspects of classical and present psychiatric views. In ensues that the view of European psychiatrists that we need psychopathology, according to the axiom: \"First things first\" (Gross and Huber 1993a, 2000a), and the call of Andreasen (Andreasen 1998) for a serious investment in training a new generation of psychiatrists in psychopathology, seem to be well founded and entirely justified."}, {"Title": "World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Guidelines for Biological Treatment of Unipolar Depressive Disorders, Part 1: Acute and continuation treatment of major depressive disorder.", "Abstract": "These practice guidelines for the biological treatment of unipolar depressive disorders were developed by an international Task Force of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP).

Patients and specialists of early intervention services together with patients and specialists of polyclinics where the services are located were interviewed using the questionnaires developed by the authors. Complexity of views of services providers and consumers together with the aspects of distribution of the information about the early intervention services and cooperation of early intervention services with other professionals was analysed. Data of the focus groups discussions with the specialists of early intervention services and analysis of the case histories are also presented. The data reflected the problems of the process of establishing the new services, period of creation and difficulties of working with children having severe disturbances and their families.

There was a statistically important difference on scales of depressiveness (p < or = 0.001) and somatic complaints (p < or = 0.001). The suicide attempters also reported a bigger number of other problems than girls of control group did. The values of subscales of aggression and delinquency were much higher than ones in the control group (p < or = 0.001). The research shows that the attempters often have not only emotional problems, but also are more aggressive and demonstrate more behavioral problems than the rest of children.

During the period between 1990 and 1995 a new model of services was developed in the Department of Social pediatrics and child psychiatry of Vilnius University. The model included development of child and adolescent psychiatric services, as well as early intervention services for infants and preschool children with developmental disabilities. The emphasis, following recommendations of WHO and existing international standards, was made on deinstitutionalization and development of family-oriented and community-based services, which have been ignored by previous system. In the first half of 90's of 20th century, new training programs for professionals were introduced, more than 50 methods of assessment, treatment and rehabilitation, new for Lithuanian clinical practice, were implemented, and a new model of services, including primary, secondary and tertiary level of prevention, was introduced in demonstration sites. However, during next phase of development, in 1997-2001, serious obstacles for replicating new approaches across the country, have been identified, which threatened successful implementation of the new model of services into everyday clinical practice. Analysis of obstacles, which are blocking development of new approaches in the field of child mental health, is presented in the article. The main obstacles, identified during analysis of socioeconomic context, planning and utilization of resources, running of the system of services and evaluation of outcomes, are as follows: lack of intersectorial cooperation between health, education and social welfare systems; strong tradition of discrimination of psychosocial interventions in funding schemes of health services; societal attitudes, which tend to discriminate and stigmatize marginal groups, including disabled children and dysfunctional families; lack of evidence-based decision making in the process of health care reform and reform of social infrastructure."}, {"Title": "[Headache in children: also a problem for child and adolescent psychiatry? Pathogenesis, comorbidity, therapy].", "Abstract": "Headache is a recurrent somatic complaint in childhood and adolescence. In recent decades headache prevalence has increased while the age of onset has decreased. In most cases headache can be categorized as migraine or tension-type headache without significant organic pathology, i.e. head trauma, structural lesion, etc. Diagnosis according to the criteria of the International Headache Society is based on subjective reports by patients and their parents. The basic tools of clinical assessment are history, physical examination and a headache diary. Laboratory tests, including electroencephalography and imaging studies should not, as a rule, be undertaken routinely. Pathophysiological models with an impact on therapeutic interventions will be discussed. Childhood headache is often treated inappropriately in daily practice despite the availability of various options (including environmental, drug, and psychological therapy). Psychological therapy (relaxation training, biofeedback, stress management, etc.) as well as medication can be applied for prophylaxis. Minimal therapeutic interventions have been shown to be equally effective in a remarkable number of patients. Chronic Headache shows relevant comorbidity with anxiety and depression and is associated with somatization and school disorders. A careful investigation and an adequate therapy of eventual psychiatric comorbidity is therefore strongly recommended."}, {"Title": "[Cooperation between office-based medical practices and hospitals in the treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents].", "Abstract": "Starting from needs assessment and actual situation of child and adolescent psychiatric care the following article describes priorities, gateways, interfaces and problems related to the co-operation of parents, children and adolescents with office- and hospital-based physicians and institutions in the early diagnosis, hospital admission, in-patient treatment and outpatient follow-up of children and adolescents with psychotic disorders.

It involves a number of interested parties--including clients, carers, clinicians and managers. Each operates according to perceived ethical principles related to their values, mores and principles. ACT condenses a dilemma that is common in psychiatry. ACT proffers social control whilst simultaneously holding therapeutic aspiration. The clients' perspective of this dilemma was studied in interviews with 12 clients using the 'grounded theory' approach. Results suggest that clients' disengagement is as much a historical and cultural phenomenon as a result of lack of insight. Many clients had experienced rejection of early help-seeking behaviour and all had been subject to coercive interventions. These coercive interventions were experienced as an attack on identity. All felt that their voice had not been listened to in previous interactions with psychiatric services. Consequentially the clients had an increased level of arousal around issues of power, which needs to be incorporated when examining the ethics of community psychiatry. Traditional notions of the difference between persuasion and coercion--for example--may need to be adapted for this client group. Results are compared with the provider perspective. We conclude that the perspectives differ on two key dimensions. Such an empirical approach to examining psychiatric ethics may ensure that we incorporate the subjectivities of various interested parties in the clinical decision-making process."}, {"Title": "Morals, suicide, and psychiatry: a view from Japan.", "Abstract": "In this paper, I argue that within the Japanese social context, the act of suicide is a positive moral act because the values underpinning it are directly related to a socially pervasive moral belief that any act of self-sacrifice is a worthy pursuit. The philosophical basis for this view of the self and its relation to society goes back to the writings of Confucius who advocated a life of propriety in which being dutiful, obedient, and loyal to one's group takes precedence over the desires of the individual selves that make up the group. I argue that this philosophical perspective poses formidable challenges to Japanese psychiatry (which accepts a contrary western perspective) because, as western psychiatry is based on the concept of autonomous individuality, the Japanese conceive of the self as socially embedded. Because suicide in Japan is viewed as a potentially honorable, virtuous, and even beautiful act of self-sacrifice expressing one's duty to one's group, the western perspective is quite foreign to the Japanese self-conceptual framework. Therefore, since Japanese psychiatry and law have embraced the western medical tradition of viewing suicide as a non-rational response to mental illness, which runs counter to the cultural view that suicide is a moral (and rational) act, I argue that western explanations of suicide present significant cross-cultural problems for Japanese psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric ethics.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric ethics spans several overlapping domains, including the guidelines for ethical research in psychiatry, the professional ethics required in the practice of psychiatry, and a broader set of moral and ethical problems and dilemmas distinctive to, or at least magnified by, the mental health care setting.

DBS is nonablative, offering the advantages of reversibility and adjustability. In theory, this characteristic might permit therapeutic effectiveness to be enhanced or side effects to be minimized. Although its mechanisms of action are unknown, several possible effects have been proposed to underlie the therapeutic effects of DBS in movement disorders, and potentially in other conditions as well. This issue is the subject of very active investigation in a number of clinical and preclinical laboratories. DBS may offer a degree of hope for patients with intractable neuropsychiatric illness. Research intended to realize this potential will require a very considerable commitment of resources, energy, and time across disciplines including psychiatry, neurosurgery, neurology, neuropsychology, and bioethics.

We compared the thresholds and sensitivities of the central and peripheral chemoreflexes between panic disorder patients and age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers to test this aspect of the hypothesis. We used a modified version of Read's rebreathing technique in 11 panic disorder patients and 10 healthy volunteers to examine the peripheral and central chemoreflex characteristics in these two populations. Subjects were examined during three rebreathing tests: training, hyperoxic (central chemoreflex alone) and hypoxic (combined central and peripheral chemoreflex). Panic symptoms were retrospectively assessed between groups using a DSM-IV derived Panic Symptom Scale. Comparisons of panic disorder patients with agoraphobia and healthy volunteers showed no significant differences in sensitivities or thresholds. Klein's hypothesis is not supported by these data.

With the exception of general internal medicine, the anticipated changes in Medicare revenue were not closely associated with income changes in either the academic or private sector group. Academic physicians were underpaid, relative to their private sector counterparts, but modestly less so at the end of the period examined. Our findings suggest that using changes in payment schedules to change incomes in order to influence the attractiveness of different specialties, even with a very large payer, may be ineffective. Should academic incomes remain uncompetitive with private sector incomes, it may be increasingly difficult to persuade physicians to enter academic careers."}, {"Title": "Chronic psychosocial stress and concomitant repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: effects on stress hormone levels and adult hippocampal neurogenesis.", "Abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is increasingly used as a therapeutic tool in psychiatry and has been demonstrated to attenuate the activity of the stress hormone system. Stress-induced structural remodeling in the adult hippocampus may provide a cellular basis for understanding the impairment of neural plasticity in depressive illness. Accordingly, reversal of structural remodeling might be a desirable goal for antidepressant therapy. The present study investigated the effect of chronic psychosocial stress and concomitant repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment on stress hormone regulation and hippocampal neurogenesis.\nAdult male rats were submitted to daily psychosocial stress and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (20 Hz) for 18 days. Cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus was quantified by using BrdU immunohistochemistry, and both the proliferation rate of progenitors and the survival rate of BrdU-labeled cells were evaluated. To characterize the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system, plasma corticotropin and corticosterone concentrations were measured.\nChronic psychosocial stress resulted in a significant increase of stress hormone levels and potently suppressed the proliferation rate and survival of the newly generated hippocampal granule cells. Concomitant repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment normalized the stress-induced elevation of stress hormones; however, despite the normalized activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system, the decrement of hippocampal cell proliferation was only mildly attenuated by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, while the survival rate of BrdU-labeled cells was further suppressed by the treatment.\nThese results support the notion that attenuation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system is an important mechanism underlying the clinically observed antidepressant effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, whereas this experimental design did not reveal beneficial effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on adult hippocampal neurogenesis."}, {"Title": "Risk assessment as collective clinical judgement.", "Abstract": "Risk assessment occupies an increasingly important position in psychiatry.

Initially positron emission tomography (PET) and now functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are causing a paradigm shift in psychiatry and the neurosciences. Psychiatry is abandoning the pharmacological model of 'brain as soup', used for much of the past 20 years. Instead, there is new realization that both normal and abnormal behavior arise from chemical processes that occur within parallel distributed networks in specific brain regions. Many of these pathological circuits are becoming well characterized, in disorders ranging from Parkinson's disease, to obsessive-compulsive disorder, to depression. Most recently, there has been an explosion of new techniques that allow for direct stimulation of these brain circuits, without the need for open craniotomy and neurosurgical ablation. The techniques include transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS). This review will describe these new tools, and overview their current and future potential for research and clinical neuropsychiatric use.

Biological psychiatry research has shown that early childhood amnesias after psychological maltreatment or abuse could be related to damage in neuronal systems which support memory, caused by glutamatergic cascade. Both severe bilateral hippocampal sclerosis (also mediated by toxic neurotransmitters) in early malignant epilepsies, and massive bilateral damage of mesial temporal lobes due to herpex virus encephalitis or Reye's syndrome, cause severe amnesic deficits, frequently accompanied by absence of any language development and autism with features of Kl\u00fcver-Bucy syndrome. There are also on record some examples of Korsakoff's syndrome in children with midfossa tumors.\nAll types of classical amnesias described in adults have been observed in children. Developmental amnesias are probably more frequent than currently presumed. It must be paid special attention to selective autobiographical memory impairments in individuals who underwent a partial bihippocampal damage in perinatal or early postnatal periods; they are to be distinguished from, although it may coexist with, other clinical situations such as attention deficit disorder or semantic pragmatic disorder."}, {"Title": "Mouse models for psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Genes involved in psychiatric disorders are difficult to identify, and those that have been proposed so far remain ambiguous. As it is unrealistic to expect the development of, say, a 'schizophrenic' or 'autistic' mouse, mice are unlikely to have the same role in gene identification in psychiatry as circling mice did in the discovery of human deafness genes. However, many psychiatric disorders are associated with intermediate phenotypes that can be modeled and studied in mice, including physiological or anatomical brain changes and behavioral traits. Mouse models help to evaluate the effect of a human candidate gene mutation on an intermediate trait, and to identify new candidate genes. Once a gene or pathway has been identified, mice are also used to study the interplay of different genes in that system."}, {"Title": "Comorbidity of substance abuse and other psychiatric disorders in acute general psychiatric admissions: a study from Lebanon.", "Abstract": "This is the first published study from an Arab Near Eastern country to examine the comorbidity of substance abuse with other psychiatric disorders. All inpatients with substance abuse/dependence (present or past) admitted to the psychiatry unit at St. George Hospital (Lebanon) between 1979 and 1992 (N = 222) constituted the study sample. Of these, 64.9% were found to have comorbid psychiatric disorders with specific relations between individual substances and psychiatric diagnoses identified such as cocaine and bipolar disorder (42.1%), and cannabis and schizophrenia (44.8%). Patients with no axis I disorder were predominantly heroin users, most of them having antisocial personality disorder. Polydrug abuse was found among 44.9% of patients, and most of the benzodiazepine abusers belonged to this category. The pattern of comorbidity of psychiatric and substance use disorders in this Near East inpatient population compares well with findings from the Western hemisphere: cultural factors (including war) do not seem to have much of an effect on the different forms of dual diagnoses. This adds weight to the already existing literature on the need for careful psychiatric assessment in the treatment of substance abuse."}, {"Title": "Informed consent: myth or reality.", "Abstract": "The rapidly growing awareness and respect of the social needs and legal rights of the patient in many countries is a sign of cultural maturity of society at large. However, the implementation of these achievements is especially arduous in the field of psychiatry because often mental patients have cognitive restrictions and/or emotional distress both of which may interfere with the exercise of their civil rights. One focus of this paper is the challenging process of obtaining legally valid consent from a severely ill psychiatric patient for diagnostic procedures and for treatment and also for participation in research projects. This paper also analyzes and discusses the new developments in the health legislation in Israel and focuses on the questions that arise in its application to the field of psychiatry. A recommendation for practical assessment of competence is presented.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation is unparalleled in its ability to test the hypotheses generated by functional neuroimaging studies by modulating activity in selected neural circuits. As a focal intervention that may in some cases exert lasting effects, TMS offers the hope of targeting and ameliorating the circuitry underlying psychiatric disorders. The ultimate success of such an approach depends on our knowledge of the neural circuitry underlying these disorders, of how TMS exerts its effects, and of how to control the application of TMS to exert the desired effects. Although most clinical trials have focused on the treatment of major depression, increasing attention has been paid to schizophrenia and anxiety disorders. Many of these trials have supported a significant effect of TMS, but in some studies the effect is small and short lived. Current challenges in the field include determining how to enhance the efficacy of TMS in these disorders and how to identify patients for whom TMS may be efficacious."}, {"Title": "Clinical skills center attending: an innovative senior medical school elective.", "Abstract": "Although residents are expected to assume teaching responsibilities, the traditional medical school curriculum does not formally prepare students for the teaching role. In 1999 an elective was developed to provide senior medical students with opportunities to acquire instructional and leadership skills by participating in clinical education activities as a clinical skills center attending. This elective also allowed the senior student to explore academic medicine as a potential career choice.\nDuring the four-week elective, a senior student acted as an attending in the clinical skills center (CSC), a state-of-the-art facility that is designed and equipped for teaching and testing medical skills. (The CSC has ten fully operational patient examining rooms for student-patient interaction, and each room is equipped with dual cameras and two-way audio response capability.) The participating student spent approximately 40 hours per week teaching clinical skills to freshmen, sophomore, and junior medical students and assisting with testing activities for the Colleges of Medicine, Pharmacy, and Nursing. A specific requirement for full credit was writing an objective standardized clinical examination (OSCE) case. The case format required development of a checklist for minimal competencies of the examinee and suggested techniques for evaluating those competencies. Another specific requirement was that the senior student participate in the training of standardized patients to portray one or more OSCE cases. Other activities were tailored to meet the needs of the senior student and/or users of the CSC. Two course co-directors provided guidance for all students. Evaluation was on a \"pass/fail\" basis. There were no written or oral exams. The purpose of the elective was achieved through individual research and completion of the assigned activities.\nThis elective was first offered to senior medical students at during 1999-2000. Each student participated in an average of ten teaching sessions or assessments. To date, six senior students, five women and one man, have completed the elective. These students entered family medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine, psychiatry, and surgery residencies. Participants were asked to rate the elective using a five-point Likert-type scale with 5 signifying \"strong agreement.\" The response rate was 67%. These students felt the requirements were adequate (4.75) and said they would recommend it to other senior students (4.75). They agreed that the objectives were clear and attainable (4.5) and that it better prepared them to teach as resident (4.25). Areas of weakness identified were the elective's ability to increase the student's understanding of medical education (3.75) and meet the student's expectations (4.0). The organization of the elective (4.0) could be improved as well. Most participants were interested in academic medicine before (4.25) and after (4.75) the experience. We plan to follow these students over time to see what careers they eventually pursue. Although our experience is limited and the student population is small, we believe the elective is an effective method for developing teaching skills and helping the upper-level medical student who is interested in education to better understand the nature and function of academic clinical medicine."}, {"Title": "Mentorship through advisory colleges.", "Abstract": "Medical students face pressures ranging from the need to create a social network to learning vast amounts of scientific material. Students often feel isolated in this system and lack mentorship. In order to counteract feelings of bureaucratic anonymity and isolation, the University of California San Francisco has created an advisory college to foster the professional and personal growth and well being of students.\nUCSF has developed a formal structure to advise medical students. A selection committee, chaired by the associate dean of student affairs, appointed five faculty mentors to head advisory colleges. These five colleges serve as the advising and well-being infrastructure for the students. Mentors were chosen from a balanced range of clinical disciplines, both primary and specialty. The disciplines are obstetrics-gynecology, otolaryngology/head and neck surgery, medicine, pediatrics, and psychiatry. The mentors have demonstrated excellence in advising and counseling of students. Mentors meet individually at the beginning of the academic year with incoming first-year and second-year students. They then have bimonthly meetings with eight to ten students within each college throughout the academic year. Curricula for these group sessions include well-being discussions and coping techniques, sessions on the hidden and informal curriculum of professionalism, and discussions on career choices and strategies. For third-year students, advisory college meetings are scheduled during intersessions, which are weeklong courses that occur between the eight-week clerkship blocks. Mentors are available throughout the year to meet with students on an as-needed basis, and advisory colleges may hold group social activities. The dean's office supports each mentor with 20% salary and provides administrative support for the group college activities.\nHistorically, UCSF students feel they receive an excellent education and appropriate job opportunities, but they do not feel they receive adequate advising and mentoring. This may have as its root cause the financial, clinical, and research pressures placed upon a faculty who are also responsible for mentoring residents and fellows. The advisory colleges begin by providing an infrastructure for developing a relationship for the student with a single faculty member. The advisory college system is incorporated into the academic schedule rather than relying on ad-hoc activities from well-meaning but inconsistently available faculty. In the early part of medical school, the advisory college relationship concentrates on assimilation into the new environment and provides the student with advice pertaining to mastering academic material. The college also serves as a sounding board for problems that can then be relayed to course directors to improve the educational experience. For students encountering academic difficulty, the college advisor can provide discreet advice about tutoring resources and can direct the student to a separately staffed Student Well-being Program. As time progresses, the mentors can direct students to key people in different fields of interest such as program directors and keep the students on track to make career decisions in a timely manner. The college system can help transform an anonymous medical school experience into a supportive, rich environment."}, {"Title": "An advanced communication skills course for fourth-year, post-clerkship students.", "Abstract": "A novel five-module advanced communication skills course entitled \"Doctor-Patient Relationships\" was planned and implemented in 2000-01 at the University of British Columbia (UBC). The course was part of the final four-month component of the new MD undergraduate program: Effective Skills for Medical Practice. The goals of the communication skills course were to (1) address problems experienced by the students so far; (2) address deficiencies in achieving the UBC exit competencies; (3) help the students pass the Medical Council of Canada examinations, in particular objectives related to the Considerations of the Legal, Ethical, and Organizational aspects of the practice of medicine (CLEO); and (4) help students prepare for their roles beyond undergraduate medicine (residency, independent practice).\nThe course was developed by an interdisciplinary team (family practice, pathology, pediatrics, psychiatry, surgery) with input from students. The broad strengths and weaknesses of their communication skills training were identified by seven third-year medical students who kept logs over the course of their clinical clerkships to document their learning of communication skills. Analysis of these logs plus feedback meetings with the students revealed attitudinal and skills issues that needed to be addressed in the new course. The goals and principles of the course were in part agreed upon by focus groups with students, attended by faculty observers, to ensure their relevance to students. The first module \"Beyond the Mask: Surviving and Thriving in Residency Training\" is designed to focus students' attention on the personal relevance of developing excellence in communication skills in preparation for residency training. It includes a video of residents talking about their experiences of communication problems to trigger reflection and discussion. In the remaining four modules the students are required to put communication skills together with their medical knowledge. Each module includes pre-readings, video demonstrations (in sessions 4 and 5), practice with standardized patients (total of 14 scenarios) and structured feedback from SPs, students, and tutor. The themes of the sessions are \"Dealing with Emotionally Challenging Patient Situations (informing about bad news), \"Compliance and Patient Information,\" \"Informed Consent and Shared Decision Making,\" and \"Difficult Physician-Patient Encounters.\" Each module lasts two hours. The course was implemented for 120 students, facilitated by 14 tutors (seven to eight students per group).\nStudent involvement in many different ways provided an important reality check and made us think about how to present the new course so that it was relevant and interesting to students. Attention to student input was a major contributor to the good evaluations given the course. Students rated the course highly: the relevance of the weekly themes was rated 4.21 on a five-point scale; the effectiveness of the SP interviews, 4.10; the effectiveness of the group discussion and feedback, 4.18; and overall course effectiveness in enhancing communication skills, 3.91. The tutors also rated the course highly, and the students rated the tutors highly.

Yet a large number of physicians and medical students may be uncomfortable discussing matters of sexuality with their patients. We have developed a comprehensive, cross-clerkship curriculum for third-year medical students that strives to fill the educational gap concerning a variety of topics in sexuality. The objectives of this project are (1) to increase awareness among medical students that communication about sexuality is central to comprehensive health care; (2) to train faculty to teach students the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for communicating effectively with patients about issues of sexuality; and (3) to improve the level of student comfort in discussing sexual issues.\nWith support from the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation (part of the UMass Macy Initiative in Health Communication), and in consultation with clerkship directors, specific topics in sexuality were chosen for inclusion in four clerkships: internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics, and psychiatry. The family medicine clerkship incorporated a fictional female adolescent into their case-based \"standardized family.\" Faculty were trained to lead their small groups in a discussion of the potentially wide range of sexual behavior in this case study. Supplemental readings were provided and a PDA application is being developed. During the internal medicine clerkship a \"difficult interview\" session was held. Student volunteers interviewed three standardized patients with sexual issues: a sexually active young woman desiring contraception, a homosexual young man at risk for HIV, and a heterosexual male noncompliant with blood pressure medication due to sexual dysfunction. An HIV counselor was brought in as a discussant. The pediatric clerkship utilized a multimodal format to cover topics pertaining to gay and lesbian youth. Included were a didactic presentation, a videotaped panel discussion featuring two youths and a parent, and a modeled patient interview. The psychiatry clerkship included three relevant interventions: a didactic session around the topic of medication-related sexual dysfunction; a videotaped modeled interview of a sexually traumatized woman; and a session involving a standardized patient-a lesbian whose sexual orientation was not part of her psychopathology. Adjunct activities included a cross-clerkship faculty development session, evaluation components, and a module designed for the staff of a private office. The latter was piloted in the office of a community pediatrician.\nMedical students who experienced the curriculum found it valuable. Student self-evaluations, done at the end of each clerkship, indicate increased comfort in dealing with issues of sexuality. During the pediatric clerkships only, half the students received the curriculum while the other half served as a comparison group. The intervention group showed a slight decrease in homophobic attitudes; the lack of a larger effect is likely due to a high level of baseline acceptance and comfort around issues of sexual orientation in this particular medical school class. The pediatric segment will be modified to take this into account and present more advanced topics around sexual orientation and interviewing. The entire curriculum is being incorporated into ongoing clerkships using existing resources at the medical school."}, {"Title": "[The history of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society during the Third Reich.

An empirical test of the satellite model].", "Abstract": "A satellite ward is a psychiatric ward at a general hospital settled within a catchment area that is administered by a distant psychiatric hospital. The objective of the satellite model is to close the gap between patients and their community on the one hand and between psychiatry and general medicine on the other. The essential size of the satellite ward that enables it to take care for the patients in its catchment area is discussed controversially. This study investigated admission rates and number of beds needed in two catchment areas distant to the psychiatric hospital from 6 months before opening until 12 months after the opening of a satellite ward with 21 beds in one of the two catchment areas. We registered an 81% increase of admission rates in this catchment area (from 130 admissions in the half-year before the opening of the satellite ward to 235 admissions in the 2nd half-year after it) and a 41% increase in beds needed (from 28.8 beds in the half-year before opening to 40.7 beds in the 2nd half-year following). This increase was significant in comparison to the increase in the controlled catchment area. Thus, only 168 (71%) patients of the catchment area (but 82% of the patients with schizophrenia) were treated in the satellite ward. The remaining patients were treated in the parent house. A selective admission of severely ill patients into the parent house was not observed."}, {"Title": "[Specific behaviour therapy day clinic].", "Abstract": "Psychiatric day care has a long tradition.

Politically committed to the national conservatives, he was attracted by many elements of National Socialist (Nazi) ideology. Still, he joined the party rather late and reluctantly. Villinger was a eugenist by firm conviction. While he still argued against hasty legal regulation of eugenic sterilisations in the Weimar Republic, he strongly moved for translating the law on preventing hereditarily ill progeny into reality in the institution of von Bodelschwingh in Bethel. Since 1941, Villinger, who had become a professor for psychiatry and neurology in Breslau in the meantime, acted as an expert in the framework of the National Socialist \"euthanasia\" programme. At the same time, however, he supported the quiet diplomacy of Rev. von Bodelschwingh in his attempt to terminate the mass murder. Villinger was also involved in criminal experiments with human beings. After 1945, he successfully continued his career in the Federal Republic of Germany. He never confronted his past during the Third Reich."}, {"Title": "[Hermann Simon--reformer of psychiatry, social Darwinist, and National Socialist?].", "Abstract": "Hermann Simon (1867-1947) was shaped in his psychiatric thinking and views of society by the German empire. He showed a strongly conservative attitude and thought in ethnic-nationalistic terms. Beginning in 1905 and drawing on practical experience, he developed the concept of a \"more active therapy.\" Simon perceived patients in a holistic way, regarding them not so much as sick people but as fellow men. He believed in the ability of a healthy personality to practice responsible and \"well ordered self determination.\" Thus he defined the role of the doctor in a new way. Within Germany as well as internationally, active therapy was well-received, especially because of its positive effect on the atmosphere within asylums. In the context of reform of so-called open care during the Weimar epoch, Simon's approach was perceived in a new way because it allowed individual views of each patient, enabling assessment of the ability to work and chances for release. Simon himself set his concept in a \"biological\" and psychological context, based on his own biologistic and social Darwinistic world view. This view was open for eugenic, racial hygienic concepts, and fundamental criticism of welfare policy. It was only a short step from this conservative tenor, understanding of the state, and biologistic thinking to his open acclaim of Hitler and National Socialist (Nazi) racist policy."}, {"Title": "[Informed consent and patient competence in the psychically ill. A review of empirical studies].", "Abstract": "In clinical practice, patients' self-determination has become more and more important. However, in psychiatry, the practice of informed consent encompasses several problems. In many cases the psychiatrist is faced with the issue of determining patients' competence. This paper gives an overview of empirical studies on competence assessment in psychiatry. In the course of some of these studies, test instruments were developed which allow objective and reliable assessment of different standards of competence. The applicability of these tests is discussed. We present empirical data on the relationship between competence and psychopathologic symptoms and cognitive factors. In recent empirical research, a shift from an initial skepticism of the applicability of informed consent in psychiatry towards a more differentiated approach and an interest in multidisciplinary research can be observed."}, {"Title": "What shapes GPs' work with depressed patients? A qualitative interview study.", "Abstract": "The ways that GPs treat depressed patients have been criticized in a number of studies.\nTo explore factors that shape how GPs work with depressed patients.\nSeventeen GPs from the county of Orebro, Sweden participated in a qualitative semi-structured interview study. GPs' conceptions of factors shaping their way of working with depressed patients, especially continuing medical education (CME), commercial information, inter-collegial support, collaboration with psychiatrists and GPs' gender were recorded.\nPrivate life experiences as well as professional experiences from family medicine were more often stressed as formative factors than university education and training in psychiatry. Groups of GPs discussisng the doctor-patient relationship set out from real cases (Balint groups) and CME groups were regarded as good forms of education. Most GPs considered company-sponsored lectures valuable. Commercial drug information was seen as more powerful than non-commercial information and GPs wished for more non-commercial information. Collaboration with psychiatry consultants was perceived as insufficient, and GPs felt a need for more inter-collegial support. Traditional female qualities were generally seen as advantageous in the work with depressed patients.\nMany GPs consider personal qualities and experiences, including those of gender, to be more influential than academic education and professional literature. This reflects a preference for individual 'tacit knowledge'. Although tacit knowledge is indispensable in consultations, the low priority given to theoretical CME may make GPs less inclined to make optimal use of different therapeutic alternatives and also less critical of commercial marketing. CME on depression should start with GPs' individual tacit knowledge and assume a more independent stance from the drug industry."}, {"Title": "[Quality criteria for psychosomatic consultation-liaison service].", "Abstract": "Besides the integrated psychosomatic models in various medical specialities (e.g. Internal medicine, Obstetrics and Gynaecology or Paediatrics), specific models of cooperation in the form of consultation-liaison (C-L) service between specialised psychosomatic-psychotherapeutic departments and other medical departments play a crucial role in providing psychosomatic care to patients. The concept 'liaison' expresses a particularly close form of cooperative activity, going far beyond the classical model of consultation services. In this context, the psychosomatic consultant has not only a fixed organised presence in the provision of patient care, he/she also participates in case discussions, hospital rounds, ward discussions and continuing education programmes of the 'partner' department. Thus, the liaison service is not only patient-centred, but also team-centred. Such consultation-liaison services, in Austria, were first established at the University Hospitals. As a consequence of laws regulating psychotherapeutic care, according to which such care is to be offered in general hospitals, increasingly C-L services are becoming part of regular care provision in more and more hospitals. Consensus groups, international as well as in German-speaking countries, are currently working on establishing quality standards in the area of psychosomatic C-L services. A working group of the scientific medical representatives has recently published guidelines for the structure, process and results of quality control. A second group, of the European Association of Consultation Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatics, is currently working on guidelines for training consultation-liaison service providers.

After reviewing the development of Freudian thought and going beyond the 'psychoanalysis and/or psychiatry?' question, he asserts that the space of the psychoanalytical cure revolves around an ethical problem. Thus, the limits of analysis should be determined by the subject's capacity for developing a structure of belief in the unconscious, with the concomitant capacity to go beyond equivocation in respect of an ethical conflict that underlies all cases where psychical suffering is manifested. Indeed, only human beings are called upon to deal with an ethical paradox-equally a logical one-which could be stated thus: there is Good in Evil and Evil in Good. This ethical paradox is the consequence of human subjection to the constituent laws of the Oedipus complex, which distances the human being, in his/her dealings with Evil and with Good, from any naturalist stance. In respect of the cure, then, we must take into account that Evil does not proceed from any particular drive-based characteristic, but is rather the expression of specific subjection to an unconscious Other, towards which it directs its affects. Finally, the author proposes a principle that emerges from the preceding discussion: let us not impute to or place in the Other our own subjective splitting or pain at existing."}, {"Title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation: a new investigational and treatment tool in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a new investigational technique used to explore various neural processes and treat a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses.

Gen. Psychiatry 50, 306-317, 1993) suggests that panic attacks are the result of a defective 'suffocation alarm' threshold that presents with carbon dioxide (CO(2)) hypersensitivity, exaggerated ventilatory response and panic in panic disorder (PD) patients. Serotonergic deficiencies enhance this ventilatory response in PD patients, as per 'suffocation alarm' theory predictions, suggesting that serotonin (5-HT) normalizes the ventilatory response. Other research supports a serotonin system-mediated stimulation of ventilation. Knowledge of 5-HT's role on ventilatory output and its neurophysiological sources impacts on the 'suffocation alarm' theory validity and predictive value. We used tryptophan depletion (TRP-) in concert with a modified Read rebreathing test to determine the effect of deficient serotonergic modulation on the central and peripheral chemoreflex threshold and sensitivity of response to CO(2) in 11 healthy men. TRP- did not affect central or peripheral chemoreflex threshold or sensitivity of response to CO(2). However, basal ventilation was significantly elevated during TRP-. In contrast to 'suffocation alarm' theory predictions, decreased 5-HT neurotransmission does not significantly affect the respiratory chemoreflex response to CO(2), impacting on non-chemoreflex drives to breathe. Panic associated respiratory abnormalities may be related to defective 5-HT modulation of non-chemoreflex drives to breathe, unrelated to any respiratory chemoreflex abnormality."}, {"Title": "[A consideration of the relation between psychiatric knowledge and natural science].", "Abstract": "Schools of psychiatric thought are as numerous as they are various, each developed from different sources and presuppositions and each claiming faithful adherents. One inherent difficulty in this profusion of choice lies in discerning whether or not a particular school's presuppositions are valid. To accept one theory is to choose one opinion towards philosophical aporiae--often at the expense of all others. In this paper, issues of scientific philosophy are examined in considering the presuppositions and progress of psychiatric schools. Popper convincingly argued that scientific statements should be \"falsifiable.\" However, because propositions of psychoanalysis or phenomenological psychiatry are closely tied to individual clinical experiences, such statements tend to be exclusive and difficult to check or falsify by other reseachers. They are, in this respect and according to Popper's point of view, necessarily less scientific. Phenomena of the human mind, by its very nature, cannot be observed nor measured directly. Interpretation of the phenomena therefore depends almost entirely upon which theoretical school the researcher has adopted. Biological psychiatry, however, insists that any researcher can objectively measure such phenomenon, and that propositions of biological psychiatry can be connected with those of other branches of natural science. Natural science grandly attempts to comprehensively describe the whole world using one language. This means the researcher is supposedly measuring an object positioned in an ideal and definite position, reached only through infinite steps. Phenomenology is very conscious that the observed object consists at least partly of the observing subject, and so this ideal positioning seems untenable. Phenomenology therefore describes this world from another point of view, different from natural science, and the distinction between measurement of certain systems from inside or outside is important for purposes of explanation and clarification. Although natural science attempts to attain the ideal infinite view, on-going science is naturally limited. In psychiatric practice, we can never rely on one definitive theory; but must rather adopt an appropriate theory to solve an appropriate problem."}, {"Title": "Strategies of collaboration between general practitioners and psychiatrists: a survey of practitioners' opinions and characteristics.", "Abstract": "The description of collaboration models and the key underlying principles provide important information for designing services. However, to apply this broad corpus of information to clinical services and policymaking, we need to know which key principles (or strategies) of collaboration are the most accepted by local physicians.\nIn this context, we designed a survey that included 2 objectives: 1) to collect the opinions of practising general practitioners (GPs) and psychiatrists in Montreal with respect to strategies for improving collaboration between these 2 groups and 2) to identify demographic and practice characteristics of those physicians associated with the acceptance of such strategies. We designed a questionnaire to specifically elicit physicians' opinions about strategies involving communication, continuing medical education (CME) for GPs in psychiatry, and access to consulting psychiatrists, as well as to identify the profiles of the respondent physicians. We mailed the questionnaire to 203 GPs and 203 psychiatrists who were randomly selected.\nThe response rate was 86% for GPs and 87% for psychiatrists. Physicians expressed favourable opinions about most strategies involving 1) the improvement of communication and 2) the organization of CME activities concerning GP practices in the field of psychiatry. On the other hand, they did not indicate acceptance of the strategies involving on-site collaboration between GPs and psychiatrists. Physician age, sex, place of practice, type of practice (such as seeing patients with or without appointments), and responsibility for administrative duties associated significantly with the degree of acceptance of the proposed strategies.\nCommunication and CME strategies for GPs in psychiatry can be an option to improve collaboration between GPs and psychiatrists. However, strategies of access to consulting psychiatrists require significant alterations to established clinical routines and professional roles."}, {"Title": "Forty years of neurotransmitters: a personal account.", "Abstract": "All drugs in psychiatry act by influences on neurotransmitter systems. Hence, an appreciation of neurotransmitter disposition helps clarify our understanding of therapeutic actions as well as adverse effects of psychotropic drugs. Moreover, understanding the nuances of neurotransmitters facilitates efforts to develop novel agents. Currently available psychoactive drugs exert their effects through 3 or 4 of the longest-known neurotransmitters. Over the past few decades, up to 100 novel neurotransmitter candidates have been identified, each of them as interesting as traditional biogenic amines. It is likely that totally new classes of therapeutic agents will emerge based on these transmitter molecules."}, {"Title": "[Analysis of gene expression at the entire genome scale--applications in biological sciences and medicine].", "Abstract": "Microarrays are one of the latest breakthroughs in experimental molecular biology, which allow monitoring of gene expression for tens of thousands of genes in parallel and are already producing huge amounts of valuable data.

A recent survey of physician computer use suggests that psychiatrists, in comparison to other types of medical specialists, may be using computers less in routine care. In this paper, we present a literature review of 57 articles on computer programs in psychiatry that were published since 1966 in five major peer-reviewed journals. We divide the types of programs that have been developed into four categories: (1) diagnostic and decision support, (2) patient screening and therapy, (3) data collection and management, and (4) data modeling. Among the first three categories, we found trends in publications during the past three decades of research. We provide a discussion of representative computer programs. Our analysis of past programs reveals a number of design problems that may be a barrier to the more widespread use of computers in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Prognostic factors in the acute phase of haemorrhagic stroke].", "Abstract": "The aim of the study was establishing which parameters play a significant prognostic role in acute haemorrhagic stroke in its acute phases (during 30 days from stroke onset). The material included 110 patients with haemorrhagic stroke (HS) treated in the years 1997-1999 at the II Neurology Department, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw or at the Neurology Department, Hospital in Pi\u0142a. The analysis of risk factors, fitness before stroke and on the first day of the disease was based on history data. On the first day of the disease the assessment included state of consciousness, brain stem signs, vomiting, stroke type on the basis of clinical condition (according to Oxford classification, OCSP), blood pressure, body temperature measurements, intensity of neurological signs according to Scandinavian scale (SSS). In the blood glucose level, fibrinogen, leucocyte count and ESR were determined. In the first week consciousness state, blood pressure and miction were checked repeatedly. It was found that serious consciousness disturbances, stroke type TACS, POCS and severe not classified stroke, presence of brain stem involvement, low SSS score, high body temperature, high leucocyte count and glucose level were more frequent in patients who died within 30 days after stroke onset. Prognostically important were also instability of blood pressure and urinary incontinence in the first week.

A special treatment for in- and outpatients in general psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Phantasy Therapy is an interdisciplinary depth-psychologically oriented group therapy form with focus on the treatment of psychoses in acute and remission phases. A different theme is presented to the patients every week on two consecutive days (90 min per session), coherently, via various sensory channels. On the first day, the theme is concretely and operationally introduced by means of an object, transformed into movement in the broadest sense of the word, and experienced directly with the body. The first session ends with a story, usually a fairy tale or parable, so that the body experiences can be further realized symbolically at the cognitive-emotional level. The second session treats the same theme via repetition of the chosen story with the deeper transformation of symbols into color and form. The first day is jointly led by a psychotherapist and a movement/ dance therapist, the second day by a psychotherapist and an art therapist. Our approach understands therapy as a somatesthetic experience- and synthetic expression-oriented encounter with the patient via the therapist's empathic imaginative identification with the patient by means of a progressively orchestrated, positivizing, cognitive-emotional, theme-centered rapport. In this connection six therapeutic elements are of importance: theme, object, movement, fairy tale, artwork, symbol. Phantasy Therapy offers the patient creative freedom in a humorous and playful way within a certain therapeutic security (Amae principle) and contradicts several classical prejudices concerning the treatment of psychotic patients."}, {"Title": "In vivo serotonin 5HT(2A) receptor binding and personality traits in healthy subjects: a positron emission tomography study.", "Abstract": "Using positron emission tomography (PET) and [(11)C]raclopride, an association between striatal D(2) dopamine receptors and emotional detachment has been recently reported. Several laboratory findings indicate a link between the serotoninergic system and harm avoidance. In this study we investigated, in a group of healthy volunteers, the relationship between the in vivo binding of 3-(2'-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)spiperone ([(18)F]FESP) to cortical 5HT(2) and striatal D(2) receptors and three personality dimensions, i.e., \"novelty seeking,\" \"reward dependence,\" and \"harm avoidance.\" Eleven healthy volunteers were evaluated by means of the Tridimensional personality Questionnaire (C. R., Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 44: 573-588.) and underwent a PET scan with [(18)F]FESP. Harm avoidance showed a significant inverse correlation with [(18)F]FESP binding in the cerebral cortex, particularly in the frontal cortex (R(2) = -0.709, P = 0.0145) and left parietal cortex (R = -0.629, P = 0.038) but not in the basal ganglia (r = -0.176, P = 0.651). Similar results were obtained using SPM at a P threshold of 0.05. No significant correlation was observed with novelty seeking or reward dependence. In the cerebral cortex, high values of [(18)F]FESP binding values are associated with a high tendency to avoid danger, indicating involvement of the serotoninergic system and, in particular, 5HT(2A) receptors, in this trait of personality. The results of this as well as of previous studies on personality dimensions indicate the existence of a relationship between behavioral and neurobiological factors. In addition these results support the concept that the variability of PET data may be explained by neurochemical differences related to the prevalence of specific personality traits."}, {"Title": "Determinants of attitude to volunteering in psychiatry: results of a public opinion survey in Switzerland.", "Abstract": "The United Nations proclaimed 2001 the \"International Year of Volunteers\".

It depends, however, on the form of volunteering. Two explanatory models for volunteering in psychiatry were found: first, the \"antipathetic person\" having social distance to and negative stereotypes towards the mentally ill. Second, the \"people with social responsibility and commitment\" who have former experience in volunteering, a positive attitude to community psychiatry, interest in mass media, a social profession and perceive discrimination of mentally ill persons. Age and gender are significant predictors.\nAn awareness and promotion campaign to use the vast potential of people willing to volunteer in psychiatry can be primarily focused on those with a basic interest in social issues.

Anxiety disorders are modestly associated with cigarette smoking. Both early onset (<13 years) cigarette smoking and conduct problems seem to be robust markers of increased psychopathology, including substance abuse, later in life. In spite of the high comorbidity, very few adolescents have nicotine dependence diagnosed or receive smoking cessation treatment in child and adolescent psychiatric treatment settings.\nThere is increasing evidence for high rates of psychiatric comorbidity in adolescent cigarette smokers. Cigarette smoking in adolescence appears to be a strong marker of future psychopathology.

Moreover, antiepileptic drugs are widely used outside epilepsy as psychotropic agents and their spectrum of activity on behavior is of considerable interest to psychopharmacology. In both neurologic and psychiatric practice, pharmacotherapy combinations are commonly used to treat comorbid psychiatric and neurologic disorders, to reduce or control the adverse effects of a medication or to increase its efficacy. This paper focuses on the metabolic pharmacokinetic interactions between two classes of psychotropic drugs: antiepileptic and antipsychotic drugs. The degree of documentation varies for many interactions from clinical case-report experiences to well established research outcomes. The evidence and the clinical significance of these interactions are reviewed. In general, it is better to use as few drugs as possible, as multicolored politherapies increase the possible adverse effects of drug interactions and reduce patient compliance."}, {"Title": "[The relationship of adverse childhood experiences to adult health: Turning gold into lead].", "Abstract": "The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study is a long term, in-depth analysis of over 17,000 adult Americans, matching their current health status against adverse childhood experiences that occurred on average a half-century earlier. We found that such adverse childhood experiences are quite common although typically concealed and unrecognized; that they still have a profound effect a half century later, although now transmutated from psychosocial experience into organic disease; and that they are the main determinant of the health and social well-being of the nation. Our findings are of direct importance to the everyday practice of medicine and psychiatry because they indicate that much of what is recognized as common in adult medicine is the result of what is not recognized in childhood.

An emerging evidence base supports the efficacy of geriatric mental health interventions. The authors provide an overview of the evidence base for clinical practice. They identified three sources of evidence-evidence-based reviews, meta-analyses, and expert consensus statements-on established and emerging interventions for the most common disorders of late life, which include depression, dementia, substance abuse, schizophrenia, and anxiety. The most extensive research support was found for the effectiveness of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for geriatric major depression and for dementia. Less is known about the effectiveness of treatments for the other disorders, although emerging evidence is promising for selected interventions. Empirical support was also found for the effectiveness of community-based, multidisciplinary, geriatric psychiatry treatment teams. The authors discuss barriers to implementing evidence-based practices in the mental health service delivery system for older adults. They describe approaches to overcoming these barriers that are based on the findings of research on practice change and dissemination. Successful approaches to implementing change in the practices of providers emphasize moving beyond traditional models of continuing medical education to include educational techniques that actively involve the learner, as well as systems change interventions such as integrated care management, implementation toolkits, automated reminders, and decision support technologies. The anticipated growth in the population of older persons with mental disorders underscores the need for a strategy to facilitate the systematic and effective implementation of evidence-based practices in geriatric mental health care."}, {"Title": "Demoralization: its phenomenology and importance.", "Abstract": "Demoralization, as described by Jerome Frank, is experienced as a persistent inability to cope, together with associated feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, meaninglessness, subjective incompetence and diminished self-esteem. It is arguably the main reason people seek psychiatric treatment, yet is a concept largely ignored in psychiatry. The aim here is to review and summarize the literature pertaining to demoralization in order to examine the validity of the construct.\nA narrative review of demoralization and the related concepts of hope, hopelessness, and meaning is presented, drawing on a range of empirical and observational studies in the medical and psychiatric literature.\nAn examination of the concepts of the 'Giving Up-Given Up' syndrome (George Engel), 'suffering' (Eric Cassell), and demoralization (Jerome Frank), demonstrate considerable convergence of ideas. Demoralization has been commonly observed in the medically and psychiatrically ill and is experienced as existential despair, hopelessness, helplessness, and loss of meaning and purpose in life. Although sharing symptoms of distress, demoralization is distinguished from depression by subjective incompetence in the former and anhedonia in the latter. Demoralization can occur in people who are depressed, cancer patients who are not depressed and those with schizophrenia. Hopelessness, the hallmark of demoralization, is associated with poor outcomes in physical and psychiatric illness, and importantly, with suicidal ideation and the wish to die.\nDemoralization is an important construct with established descriptive and predictive validity.

For example, the finding that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is hypersecreted in depressed patients and mediates certain symptoms of depression has led to the development of specific antagonists of the CRF(1) receptor. These are expected to prove highly effective for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. Another related avenue of research is based on evidence that cortisol is integral to the pathophysiology of major depression with psychotic features. One alternative for treating this subtype of affective disorder is, therefore, to block the action of glucocorticoids using a receptor antagonist such as mifepristone. These are just two of the many new directions that will likely lead to the development of antidepressants in the near future."}, {"Title": "Policy, organisation and practice of specialist old age psychiatry in England.", "Abstract": "To describe and compare service arrangements in old age psychiatry across England according to three broad domains: (i) levels of professional autonomy; (ii) degree of community orientation (delivery of and links with community services) and (iii) degree of integration between health and social care provision.\nCross sectional survey of consultants in old age psychiatry in England.

The rehabilitation program was designed to allow the patients to understand their illness, cope with their medical regimen, and prevent a relapse by recognizing any of the symptoms when they recur. This study consisted of three phases. The first phase was to explore the extent and the specific mental health needs of psychiatric patients. Data was obtained from 82 subjects who had symptoms of a mental illness including schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and delusional disorder. They had received medication instruction during their hospitalization. The subjects were at the time outpatients in a psychiatric hospital. In the second phase, the researchers developed an educational program focused on coping with the residual and relapse warning signs, managing the drug side effects, medication compliance, and daily routines, according to the information acquired in the first step. The developed program includes the self-efficacy method reported by Bandura, including manuals and videotapes focusing on real life situations, small group discussions, and telephone coaching. Finally, the researchers investigated the effects of this program. Thirty-eight patients were selected for this study, 18 in the experimental program and 20 as controls. The diagnoses were same as those with the first step. The results showed that the subjects who attended this educational program reported significantly more improvement in self-efficacy (p=0.014) and medication compliance (p= 0.005), and significantly less relapse warning symptom scores (p=0.000) than the controls. In conclusion, these instructional materials will be beneficial for medication and symptom management in rehabilitating psychiatric patients in Korea.

During training, psychiatry residents are exposed to constant transitions with frequent shifts in training sites and supervisors. Change is perhaps the most consistent characteristic of residency training. And yet, the maintenance of a changeless, stable frame is considered the gold standard for psychotherapy. The effect of a constantly shifting framework on the training therapist, the patient, and the therapy itself is considered. Reflecting on the multiple and varied themes elucidated by the case, it is evident that there are rich opportunities for growth for both the patient and the trainee who embark on a course of therapy together. Contrary to widely held beliefs, rather than diluting the psychotherapy and diminishing the learning experience, change can be a stimulating and enriching force."}, {"Title": "Ethics in child and adolescent forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Ethical concerns are ever present in the practice of all branches of psychiatry. They are likely to be more acute and commonplace in the practice of child and adolescent psychiatry because of the complication introduced by the immaturity of the patient. Children, depending on their age and developmental stage, may be incapable of giving meaningful consent, and situations in which breaking confidentiality must be considered arise more often. The field of forensic psychiatry is fundamentally different from clinical psychiatry because of the universal involvement of third parties and because interactions with evaluees do not occur within the context of a doctor patient relationship. Arguably, these conditions compel the forensic psychiatrist to function as a double agent. According to Appelbaum, an influential psychiatric ethicist, forensic practice calls for a different set of ethical guidelines that, while humane, do not either imply or derive from the existence of a doctor patient relationship. Others argue that a mix of forensic and clinical ethics is more appropriate. New developments in psychiatry, including the use of the Internet for E-mail and telepsychiatry, require continuing vigilance by the profession so that ethical standards can evolve to cover new circumstances at the frontiers of psychiatric practice."}, {"Title": "Malpractice in child and adolescent psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Over the past 40 years, malpractice suits in child and adolescent psychiatry have gone from almost nonexistent to a source of major concern. Suits that involve child and adolescent patients remain fairly uncommon, and no damages are paid in six out of seven cases. The two cardinal principles for the clinician in avoiding and defending malpractice suits are to practice in accordance with his or her best clinical judgment and to document care, particularly in areas in which an unexpected adverse result may lead to a lawsuit. The most common areas that give rise to suit are failure to protect a child inpatient from assault or sexual interaction with another inpatient, adolescent suicide, medication errors, and issues related to child abuse. Evolving areas of malpractice law derive from incipient patient's rights legislation, development of the \"direct victim\" test in cases brought by third-party parents against therapists who have diagnosed children as sexually abused, implementation of new federal rules regarding privacy of records, and provision of medical information or treatment over the Internet."}, {"Title": "Juvenile justice mental health services.", "Abstract": "As the second century of partnership begins, child psychiatry and juvenile justice face continuing challenges in meeting the mental health needs of delinquents. The modern juvenile justice system is marked by a significantly higher volume of cases, with increasingly complicated multiproblem youths and families with comorbid medical, psychiatric, substance abuse disorders, multiple family and psychosocial adversities, and shrinking community resources and alternatives to confinement. The family court is faced with shrinking financial resources to support court-ordered placement and treatment programs in efforts to treat and rehabilitate youths. The recognition of high rates of mental disorders for incarcerated youth has prompted several recommendations for improvement and calls for reform [56,57]. In their 2000 annual report, the Coalition for Juvenile Justice advocated increased access to mental health services that provide a continuum of care tailored to the specific problems of incarcerated youth [58]. The specific recommendations of the report for mental health providers include the need for wraparound services, improved planning and coordination between agencies, and further research. The Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention has set three priorities in dealing with the mental health needs of delinquents: further research on the prevalence of mental illness among juvenile offenders, development of mental health screening assessment protocols, and improved mental health services [59]. Other programs have called for earlier detection and diversion of troubled youth from juvenile justice to mental health systems [31,56]. Most recently, many juvenile and family courts have developed innovative programs to address specific problems such as truancy or substance use and diversionary or alternative sentencing programs to deal with first-time or nonviolent delinquents. All youths who come in contact with the juvenile justice system should be screened and, when necessary, assessed for mental health and substance abuse disorders. The screening should occur at the youth's earliest point of contact with the juvenile justice system and should be available at all stages of juvenile justice processing. Whenever possible, youth with serious mental health disorders should be diverted from the juvenile justice system [58]. If delinquent youths do not receive the necessary evaluation, treatment, and rehabilitation, they face the real prospect of further incarceration in adult correctional facilities. Improved screening and treatment require better interagency collaboration, established standards of care, and continuing research on the mental health needs of youth in the juvenile justice system. Better mental health care for youth in the juvenile justice system supports the goal of rehabilitation. Mental health professionals should support these efforts as the appropriate response to meet the challenges of the new century."}, {"Title": "The forensic evaluation and court testimony.", "Abstract": "The practice of forensic child psychiatry is a relatively new subspecialty.

This strategy is hampered by the ephemeral nature of the viral genome. Lithium salts are widely used in psychiatry as mood-stabilizing agents. Studies have revealed, however, that the lithium ion also has significant granulopoietic actions, as well as regulatory effects on select cytokines that enable it to boost the body's natural defense against viral infections, specifically DNA viruses. Moreover, case reports in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, as well as animal studies using related immunodeficiency viruses, provide support for a novel therapeutic role for lithium salts in the treatment of HIV infection. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed an important additional benefit of the lithium ion. In both in vitro and human studies, lithium has been found to increase the synthesis of neuroprotective proteins and to exert possible neurotrophic effects in the human brain.

Medical school background was not related to main occupation; over 90% of all graduates were employed in clinician positions. A greater proportion of Newcastle than Sydney graduates were either training or qualified in family medicine or psychiatry rather than in other specialties.

In the USA alone, the number of living donor liver transplantations has increased six-fold in the last 4 years. The therapy can be complex, bringing together a variety of disciplines, including transplantation medicine and surgery, hepatology, psychiatry and medical ethics. Moreover, living donor liver transplantation is still defining itself in the adult-to-adult application. Uniform standards, guidelines and long-term outcomes are yet to be determined. Nevertheless, initial success has been remarkable, and a basic understanding of this field is essential to any physician contemplating options for their liver failure patients.

Research on the effect of empathy on health outcomes in primary care is lacking, but studies in mental health and in nursing suggest it plays a key role. Empathy can be improved and successfully taught at medical school especially if it is embedded in the students actual experiences with patients. A variety of assessment and feedback techniques have also been used in general medicine psychiatry and nursing. Further work is required to determine if clinical empathy needs to be, and can be, improved in the primary care setting."}, {"Title": "Distance learning project--information skills training: supporting flexible trainees in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This one-year project was designed to investigate the skills training needs of a group of 12 specialist registrars in psychiatry working as flexible trainees (part time) in the NHS. They had expressed concerns about their lack of information technology skills at training assessment seminars. A part-time project officer, was appointed to support the group giving information skills training to each flexible trainee on an individual basis, through a series of home visits. The project officer worked under the supervision of the London Library & Information Development Unit (LLIDU) from a home base, to identify with the insular feelings expressed by the project group. Project funding purchased a laptop computer with modem and a printer for each participant to use during the project. The training covered: basic search skills and developing search strategy techniques using quality filters particularly in relation to the MEDLINE database; how to search the Cochrane Library and PubMed and exploiting Internet information resources. The group asked for help with word processing and presentation software use. These needs were met in a series of half-day workshops.

Particularly French psychiatry demonstrated a real willingness and ability to respond to the clinical realities. The conceptual problem of what DSM IV now classified as acute stress disorder was resolved so successfully that this disorder deserves the eponym \"Viovenel's Syndrome\". American Military Psychiatry followed the French methods of precise diagnosis and expeditious treatment close to the front and amplified them by creating effective treatment methods : brief psychotherapy methods and group psychotherapy within a therapeutic environment. Franco-American psychiatry thereby created the foundation for modern community psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[About the use of restraints in psychiatry: the patient's point of view].", "Abstract": "Previous research about the use of restraints has mainly sought generalizations regarding who is likely to be restrained, the frequency of the use of restraints, and the behavior that precipitates the application of restraining devices. Therefore, there has been a paucity of research that attempts to understand the impact of restraint on the restrained person. The purpose of this study is to understand the meaning of the experience of being restrained for 43 psychiatric patients who had been restrained in leather restraints. Participants were interviewed in unstructured interviews. The taped interviews were transcribed and analyzed by means of a modification of an interpretive process, grounded in phenomenology.

Indeed, discrepancies in the behavioural patterns of mice or rats in the same anxiety tests performed in different laboratories have been reported recently. The question raised by such data addressed, in particular, the selection and breeding of two lines of rats on the basis of their high (HAB) and low (LAB) anxiety-related behaviour in the elevated plus-maze test at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich (Germany). As the majority of the behavioural data in these animals has been derived from research carried out in this institute, the aims of the present study were: (1) to test the reliability of the differences in anxiety-related behaviour of these rats in two other laboratories (Villeneuve d'Ascq, France and Innsbruck, Austria); and (2) to determine how the different behavioural traits were associated in both HAB and LAB rats by a principal component analysis. Results were in agreement with the studies performed in Munich, as the divergence in anxiety-related behaviour of the two lines was highly consistent in all tests performed in Villeneuve d'Ascq and Innsbruck. Moreover, the most important parameters to discriminate the two lines were similar to those found in a previous study. Finally, the principal component analysis again confirmed that the selection of HAB and LAB rats is based on anxiety-related behaviour rather than locomotor activity."}, {"Title": "[Concept of quality of life, results of studies of 13,000 subjects].", "Abstract": "A questionnaire (Subjective Quality of Life Profile, or SQLP) was finalized at the end of the eighties by our team. It was endorsed and tested on more than 13,000 subjects recruited outside of any medical context, or suffering from any somatic or psychological pathologies. On a conceptual framework, the questionnaire takes into account the subject's history independent from the context of his/her personal objectives. It differentiates quality of life from health, and stresses its multi-factorial aspect. The questionnaire is made up of 28 \"inevitable\" items covering four domains: relational, somatic, contextual and psycho-affective, as well as a list of optional items. Two types of questions pertaining to history are applied to each item, as well as to the anticipated expectations. The results are of interest in the following domains: 1) To specify the demands and complaints of subjects afflicted with various illnesses, and comparing them with healthy subjects. 2) To demonstrate the impact of various factors on the quality of life. 3) To observe patients' development following long-term or difficult therapy. 4) To be able to compare (once the questionnaires are filled out by different contributors), the patient's responses to those of his family or caregiver. 5) To take into account the patients' illness in order to provide the most pertinent results. These illnesses are always higher in psychiatry (and in particular those suffering from addictions): and are an unfavorable prognoses. Once the patient improves clinically, their illness decreases. 6) Regarding associates whose illnesses are at a \"normal\" level, the illness does not prove to be more serious than in exposed situations (either medical or social). At the moment it seems that the evaluation of a patient's quality of life brings an enriching, clarification to the appreciation of traditional medicine. Avoiding a social \"desirability\" criteria, we believe the responses relative to the illnesses will provide the best indication of the subjects' quality of life."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry reform in Brazil from the 1980's to present days: its history and concepts].", "Abstract": "This article presents a brief history of the Brazilian psychiatry reform from the 1980's and 1990's to April 2001, when the Mental Health Law was finally signed.

On the one hand, these circuit- and device-based approaches to treating depression are not new. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) dates back to the beginning of modern biologic psychiatry with the discovery and rapid increase of first chemical (around 1910), and then later ECT. On the other hand, this area represents an important paradigm shift with treatments that are radical and different. A dizzying array of diverse technologies now allows researchers to stimulate the brain in undreamed of ways. However, the approaches described in this article are still considered experimental and are not approved for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), except ECT, which predates the FDA. These device-based approaches to brain stimulation offer promise as potential acute and even longterm treatments. Additionally, the research determining whether and how these devices work to influence mood promises to help unravel the neurophysiology of mood regulation. These novel treatments are thus the translational tools to bridge from advances in brain imaging, into new treatments for depressed patients."}, {"Title": "Arterial endothelial function is impaired in treated depression.", "Abstract": "To determine whether patients with treated depression but no other risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) have abnormal arterial endothelial function, an abnormality that is common to other acquired risk factors for CHD.\nCase-control study.\nSecondary care departments of cardiology and psychiatry in a single centre and the surrounding community.\nPatients with treated depression and matched healthy controls, aged 18-55 years, without conventional acquired risk factors for CHD.

However, in areas underserved by mental health professionals, the treatment of depressed patients becomes challenging. Furthermore, patients living in rural areas and communities underserved by health professionals are at risk for high levels of depressive symptoms and low access to care. Physicians (N = 58) of multiple nonpsychiatric specialties in Imperial County, a rural underserved area in California, were surveyed to ascertain their preferred strategies in the management of depressed patients. More than half (57%) of the respondents preferred to either refer patients to a mental health specialist (p < .01) as the only strategy, or in combination with counseling, prescribing medication, or both. The most commonly reported form of counseling was of a supportive nature. The most commonly prescribed drugs were selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (in order of frequency:fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine). Tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines were identified as first-line drugs by some pediatricians and surgeons.

Proof of this is the fact that it constitutes the second most commonly alleged cause for absolution of responsibility in Spain, according to the jurisprudence from the Supreme Court (1976 1995).\nThroughout history it has been classified as a magical, supernatural disease and has been studied within psychiatry as an endogenous psychosis. It has therefore been considered a form of madness, which has led to court decisions that have taken this concept into account. The supposed dangerousness of suffers from epilepsy must be the exception, and their supposed epileptic characters and personalities that drive them to commit atrocious murders are no longer of any relevance. The problems stemming from epileptic seizures are to be seen in civil, penal, military, canonical and labour law, very often in an exclusive fashion.\nWe think it is worthwhile reviewing these concepts with a view to their undergoing a later modification, which would lead to the full integration of these patients and to their being considered as suffering from a neurological illness."}, {"Title": "[Primary care and alcohol use disorders: evaluation of a faculty-development program in Venezuela].", "Abstract": "Primary care offers an opportunity to identify and treat persons who drink alcohol above permissible levels. In order to prepare primary care practitioners around the world to prevent and treat alcohol-related problems, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the United States of America has developed and tested a model international program for educating physicians about such problems. The model was designed to increase the clinical, teaching, and research skills of medical school faculty who work with medical students, residents, and primary care physicians. Venezuela was one of the countries selected for the initiative.\nDuring September 1999 a five-day faculty-development course consisting of 19 workshops was conducted at the University of Zulia, which is located in the city of Maracaibo, Zulia, Venezuela. Teaching strategies included class presentations, role plays, case presentations, skills-building workshops, and having each participant develop a teaching plan that he or she would use.\nThirty-three faculty members from 9 of Venezuela's 10 medical schools participated in the project. The 18 female and 15 male participants had an average age of 44 years. The areas of specialization of the 33 participants were: family medicine (9 participants), psychiatry (7), pediatrics (6), obstetrics (4), internal medicine (3), and unspecified (4).

Neuro-Psycol. Biol. Psychiatry, 26, 763 (2002)].", "Abstract": "Cushing's syndrome is due to chronic glucocorticoid excess that may have various etiologies. The most common endogenous form is pituitary-dependent bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, which is termed Cushing's disease. Major depression occurs in more than half of the cases. The presence of depressive symptoms connotes severity of clinical presentation and, in patients with hypothalamic-pituitary forms, entails prognostic value. Medical treatment may be used while awaiting more definitive solutions for the illness by surgery. The inhibitors of steroid production (e.g., ketoconazole, metyrapone and aminoglutethimide), rather than antidepressant drugs, are generally successful in lifting depression as well as other disabling symptoms. Since central serotonergic regulation could have a role in the course of Cushing's disease, serotonin antagonists (e.g., cyproheptadine, ritanserin and ketanserin) have been employed. Findings related to the pharmacological response of depression in Cushing's disease were found to have implications for the pathophysiology of depression and the potential involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) in resistance and tolerance to antidepressant drugs. The use of serotonergic drugs in Cushing's disease may yield important insights in the understanding of serotonergic regulation both in Cushing's disease and in the HPA axis in nonendocrine major depression."}, {"Title": "[Program and practice of psychiatric genetics at the German Research Institute of Psychiatry under Ernst R\u00fcdin: on the relationship between science, politics and the concept of race before and after 1993].", "Abstract": "The first research institution exclusively devoted to psychiatric genetics was the Department of Genealogy and Demography at the German Psychiatric Research Institute (Deutsche Forschungsanstalt f\u00fcr Psychiatrie) in Munich.

This paper analyses programme and practice of psychiatric genetics at the Munich Institute as well as R\u00fcdin's involvement in Nazi mental health policy including his active support of the systematic patient killings ('euthanasia'). It is argued that the idea of a healthy 'race' was a guiding principle motivating all of R\u00fcdin's research and political activities, and that it is not possible to distinguish in his work a phase of 'good' research (in scientific terms) untainted by racial ideas from a phase of 'bad' (pseudo-) research contaminated by racial ideology."}, {"Title": "[Landau-Kleffner and autistic regression: the importance of differential diagnosis].", "Abstract": "Some neurological disorders may present psychiatric signs and symptoms, therefore the search for an etiological diagnosis is crucial.

These searches were augmented by personal correspondence with experts on changes in practice patterns in psychiatry and on medical and psychiatric communications research. A review of references within each article and information from the experts identified other relevant articles. Selection was then narrowed to include reports of studies that used structured written instruments that captured relevant physician and patient perceptions of the physician-patient relationship, content analysis of audio- or videotapes of communication in medical or psychiatric encounters, or interaction analysis systems used to categorize audio- or videotaped communicative behaviors in medical or psychiatric encounters.\nTwenty-five articles in medicine and 34 articles in psychiatry were selected. Medical communication researchers have observed associations between physicians' communicative skills and patients' satisfaction, patients' adherence to treatment recommendations, treatment outputs, and patients' willingness to file malpractice claims. The research has also shown that primary care physicians can be more responsive to patients' concerns without lengthening visits. In psychiatry, the literature can be organized into four discrete categories of research: negotiated treatment and the customer approach, therapeutic alliance, Gottschalk-Gleser content analysis of patients' speech, and content analysis of psychiatric interviews."}, {"Title": "Perspectives on disaster mental health intervention from the USNS Comfort.", "Abstract": "Immediately after September 11, 2001, the USNS Comfort was deployed to provide relief to the rescue workers involved with the World Trade Center collapse.

Subjects with a psychiatric disorder received a psychotropic treatment only infrequently (between 10% to 40.4%, depending on the disorder). All psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders, were treated mainly with an anxiolytic. A concomitant physical illness increased the likelihood of using a psychotropic treatment and was a strong predictor of adequate psychotropic dosage.\nPsychiatric pathology and sleep disorders remained mostly untreated or inadequately managed in the general population. Depression is underdiagnosed by the physicians and is treated with antidepressant in only 7% of cases. By contrast, anxiolytics are extensively prescribed, especially in France and Italy.

Yet our progress since those serendipitous discoveries has been disappointing. We still do not understand with certainty how those medications produce their desired clinical effects. We have not introduced newer medications with fundamentally different mechanisms of action than the older agents. We have not identified the genetic and neurobiological mechanisms underlying depression and mania, nor do we understand the mechanisms by which nongenetic factors influence these disorders.

The rapidly evolving disciplines of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics seek to uncover this genetic variation in order to predict treatment outcomes. The goal is to be able to select the drugs with the greatest likelihood of benefit and the least likelihood of harm in individual patients, based on their genetic make-up-individualized therapy. Pharmacogenomic studies utilize genomic technologies to identify chromosomal areas of interest and novel putative drug targets, while pharmacogenetic strategies rely on studying sequence variations in candidate genes suspected of affecting drug response or toxicity. The candidate gene variants that affect function of the gene or its protein product have the highest priority for investigation. This review will provide demonstrative examples of functional candidate gene variants studied in a variety of antipsychotic response phenotypes in the treatment of schizophrenia. Serotonin and dopamine receptor gene variants in clozapine response will be examined, and in the process the need for sub-phenotypes will be pointed out. Our recent pharmacogenetic studies of the subphenotype of neurocognitive functioning following clozapine treatment and the dopamine D(1) receptor gene (DRD1) will be presented, highlighting our novel neuroimaging data via [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) metabolism position emission tomography (PET) that demonstrates hypofunctioning of several brain regions in patients with specific dopamine D(1) genotype. Preliminary candidate gene studies investigating the side-effect of clozapine-induced weight gain are also presented. The antipsychotic adverse reaction of tardive dyskinesia and its association with the dopamine D(3) receptor will be critically examined, as well as the added influence of antipsychotic metabolism via the cytochrome P450 1A2 gene (CYP1A2 ). Results that delineate the putative gene-gene interaction between DRD3 and CYP1A2 are also presented. We have also utilized FDG-PET subphenotyping to demonstrate increased brain region activity in patients who have the dopamine D(3) genotype that confers increased risk for antipsychotic induced tardive dyskinesia. The merits and weaknesses of neuroimaging technologies as applied to pharmacogenetic analyses are discussed. To the extent that the above data become more widely verified and replicated, the field of psychiatry will move closer to clinically meaningful tests that will be useful in deciding the best drug for each individual patient."}, {"Title": "Psychological complexity: barriers to its integration into the neurobiology of major psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "In the authors' experience interactions between clinical and laboratory research have been greatly mutually facilitatory in the understanding and development of new treatments for the major mental illnesses. Examples in the literature are also highlighted to show how cross-disciplinary studies are important in understanding the subtle interactions of genetic and environmental mechanisms in psychiatric illness. Yet, the results of some current science policies encouraging project focus and superspecialization can lead to the separation of clinical and basic investigators, which threatens the integration of psychological complexity into the neurobiology of psychiatry at both a molecular and behavioral level.

A cost-minimization analysis was done using an algorithm which allowed all direct costs to the service to be taken into account. A sensitivity analysis changed key values of the algorithm allowing their relative contribution to be considered.\nThe domiciliary clinic was marginally cheaper than outpatient assessment (48 pounds sterling compared to 50 pounds sterling per successful assessment). The most important variables in determining the cost effectiveness of the service were non-attendance rates, the grade of doctor seeing the patient and the time spent traveling for the home assessment.\nDomiciliary initial assessments were comparable in cost to clinic assessments in this study but in other situations the cost will vary, depending on the key local variables."}, {"Title": "Domiciliary clinics I: effects on non-attendance.", "Abstract": "To compare the rate of non-attendance for new referrals to a hospital based clinic versus home assessment.\nTwo old age psychiatry services in an urban area.\nA four year prospective study comparing rates of non-attendance for new referrals to a hospital based clinic versus assessment at home in two parallel old age psychiatry services.\nThe rate of non-attendance for new referrals seen at home was considerably lower (1.7%) than the hospital based clinic (21.2%).\nAssessing new outpatient referrals to old age psychiatry services at home reduces non-attendance.

The death causes are suicide and somatic complications resulting from cachexy, laxatives and diuretics abuse, which occurs in some patients and from vomiting provocation. The digestive tract complications are considered to be the death causes in a.n, as well. Among the surgical complications, which usual occur in the initial period of the intensive nutrition the most serious and frequent ones are oesophageal rupture in the course of vomiting provocation (Boerhaave's syndrome) and the syndrome of compression of the horizontal part of the duodenum, by the mesentery (superior mesenteric artery syndrome) leading to the gastrectasia and possible gastric necrosis and perforation. In this paper the review of the current literature concerning the digestive tract complications in a.n. has been made. Also, the courses of the diseases and the complications requiring surgical intervention in 3 patients treated between 1998 and 2000 in the Department of Child Psychiatry and the Department of Cardiosurgery of the Medical University of Warsaw have been discussed. The patients developed segmental enteritis, gastrectasia caused by the superior mesenteric artery syndrome and small intestine strangulation. The early surgical intervention in the latter case and the proper maintenance treatment in two other ones allowed to avoid more serious complications. The authors postulate profound analysis of the abdominal complaints from the point if view of surgical complications in anorectic patients in the initial period of their hospital treatment and consideration of the complete parenteral hyperalimentation in the extremely debilitated to avoid life threatening digestive tract complications."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatrists looking at biology.

More than 95% of patients will require 24-hour care either in long-stay hospital wards or in nursing homes at the end of life. There are many issues in the care of patients with dementia that parallel palliative cancer care, but relatively few patients with dementia currently access palliative care. Following an initial audit that found that many patients dying with dementia had symptoms that were not palliated, multidisciplinary guidelines were developed jointly by medical and nursing staff working in psychiatry for older people, together with pharmacy and palliative care staff. Following the implementation of guidelines, there was a significant decrease in the prescribing of antibiotics in the last 2 weeks of life and patients were much more likely to be prescribed analgesia, including opiates. This small study suggests that when developed collaboratively, multidisciplinary guidelines can have a positive impact on palliative care for non-oncology patients."}, {"Title": "Clerkship order and performance on family medicine and internal medicine National Board of Medical Examiners Exams.", "Abstract": "Taking National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) subject examinations later in the year is known to lead to higher scores.

It has been shown to be a safe and well tolerated method. Lately this technique has also found its way to psychiatry for the treatment of mood disorders. Several studies which investigated TMS of deeper brain regions found antidepressive effects in analogy to electro convulsive therapy (ECT). This could present a significant advantage, because TMS provides non-invasive and painless stimulation of the cerebral cortex. The method is based on the principle that a time-varying magnetic field induces an electric field which leads to activation of inhibitory and excitatory neurons in neural tissue. The magnetic field pervades the intact scalp and skull without loss of energy. Both case reports as well as clinical studies have shown that TMS could present a promising option in the treatment of depression. A review of the literature demonstrates that further studies are needed to clarify many questions regarding technical and clinical aspects, such as dosage, duration of application, localization of the coils, as well as the impact of rapid-rate TMS and stronger magnetic field generators, before TMS will become an established tool in the treatment of psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Annotation: randomised trials.", "Abstract": "This annotation describes the uses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in clinical child psychology and psychiatry.\nIt explores the scientific basis for randomised designs, the conceptual and methodological issues that can arise when using them, alternative methods, and future directions.\nThere are many issues that have to be tackled when using randomised trials to answer questions about the effectiveness of interventions used by child mental health professionals.

This review of contemporary literature suggests that VR has been successfully used to simulate person-to-person interactions for training in psychiatry and the social sciences in a variety of circumstances by using real-time simulations of personal interactions, and to launch 3-dimensional trainers for surgical simulation. These successful applications and simulations suggest that this technology may be helpful and should be evaluated as an educational modality in obstetrics and gynecology in two areas: (1) counseling in circumstances ranging from routine preoperative informed consent to intervention in more acute circumstances such as domestic violence or rape, and (2) training in basic and advanced surgical skills for both medical students and residents.\nVirtual reality is an untested, but potentially useful, modality for training in obstetrics and gynecology.

Much of forensic psychiatry is practiced by general psychiatrists without specific forensic training who must thereby familiarize themselves with the problem areas likely to be encountered in this work. They should also be knowledgeable about the ethics guidelines prepared by forensic psychology and forensic psychiatry organizations that are subject to frequent modification. Ethical problems often occur when psychiatrists exceed their expertise, their role as contracted, or the actual facts in the case. Psychiatric experts usually represent just a small part of most litigation, and an attitude of humility rather than grandiosity is appropriate. Expert witnesses serve as educators rather than decision makers in the case [21]. Given the complexity and uncertainty of medical decision making generally, whether in clinical or forensic medicine, forensic psychiatric opinions should be appropriately qualified by their limitations, acknowledged affirmatively rather than only on cross-examination. Expert witnesses commonly take an oath to \"tell the truth, the whole truth.\" Forensic psychiatrists are not experts in moral matters and should not be rendering moral judgments or misusing their authority as psychiatrists to advance their own political or social ideology [19]. Testimony should be based on data and theory generally accepted in the profession, recognizing that there will always be minority views. Psychiatrists, however, should not be testifying based upon idiosyncratic views unsupported by at least a respectable minority of the profession.

We face unknown challenges in psychiatric genetics projects, studies of psychopharmacological interventions in children, controversial scientific designs (e.g., symptom challenge, medication-free interval), and cross-disciplinary research incorporating goals and methods of health services, epidemiology, and social and behavioral science endeavors. Boundaries between innovative clinical practices and research-related experimentation will become increasingly difficult to distinguish, as will the roles between clinicians, clinical researchers, and basic scientists. Moreover, the institutions and systems in which research occurs are being rapidly and radically revised, raising new questions about oversight responsibilities and standards. Our ability to identify and respond to the ethical questions arising in this uncharted territory will depend on our willingness to self-reflect, to integrate the observations and insights of the past century, to think with great clarity, and to anticipate novel ethical problems that keep company with scientific advancements. It will also depend on data. Empirical study of ethical dimensions of human research is essential to anchor and attune the intuitions and theoretical constructs that we develop. Science and ethics have changed over the past 100 years, as they will over the next century. It is ironic that the ethical acceptability of psychiatric research is so much in question at this time, when it holds so much promise for advancing our understanding of mental illness and its treatment. The tension between the duty to protect vulnerable individuals and the duty to perform human science will continue to grow, as long as ethics and science are seen as separable, opposing forces with different aims championed by different heroes. The profession of psychiatry is poised to move toward a new, more coherent research ethics paradigm in which scientific and ethical issues are recognized as inextricably linked: science as a human activity carries complex ethical meanings and responsibilities, and ethics itself is subject to scrutiny and amenable to scientific inquiry. Building a broader, more versatile, and more effective repertoire of safeguards will be increasingly important, and safeguards, in this view, represent a modest price for the privilege of studying serious illnesses--diseases that cause grave suffering and yet are a source of both vulnerability and strength. In this paradigm, attention to ethics safeguards is no longer understood as a barrier to scientific advancement, but rather as the means by which psychiatric research may be conducted with broad societal support, honorably and, ultimately, with the expectation of bringing benefit to millions of people with mental illness."}, {"Title": "Immunological research in clinical psychiatry: report on the consensus debate during the 7th Expert Meeting on Psychiatry and Immunology.", "Abstract": "There is convincing evidence that cytokines are involved in the physiology and pathophysiology of brain function and interact with different neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine pathways.

Furthermore, the A allele was also transmitted with an older age at onset (P = 0.023) using a quantitative-trait TDT approach. The A allele may thus act as a modifying factor (delaying onset), potentially explaining variations of allele frequency across samples, in which differences in average age at onset are not only possible, but also expected. Taking into account vulnerability genes, but also genes modifying the expression of the disorder, will help to disentangle the complexity of the etiological factors involved in anorexia nervosa."}, {"Title": "Quality of life and standard of living in a randomly selected group of psychiatrically disabled people in Sweden 2 years after a psychiatry reform.", "Abstract": "In Sweden, a psychiatry reform, aimed at improving the living conditions of the psychiatrically disabled, came into force in 1995.

Coprescription of typical antipsychotics PRN with regularly scheduled atypical antipsychotics was common (64%). Pro re nata medications accounted for 31% of the total antipsychotic dose and 28% of the total anxiolytic dose administered during acute treatment. Higher daily doses of PRN medication were given to manic patients, males, younger patients and those with substance use disorders. Pro re nata prescriptions usually specified a maximum daily dose (87%) but rarely gave indications for use (6%). Administration records frequently lacked a specified reason for use (48%) or a notation of outcome (64%). Unit staff noted medication-related morbidity in 37% of patients receiving PRN medication, compared to 3% of patients receiving only regularly scheduled medication. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were most frequently associated with administration of PRN haloperidol (Relative Risk vs other PRN medications = 5.61, 95% CI = 2.36-13.73).\nPro re nata medications comprised a significant part of the treatment which psychotic patients received. The common practice of coprescribing PRN typical antipsychotics with scheduled atypical antipsychotics is potentially problematical since administration of PRN medication is associated with significant medication related morbidity. Preferential use of benzodiazepines as PRN agents may minimize this morbidity and foster subsequent compliance with regularly prescribed antipsychotics."}, {"Title": "Project for a scientific psychiatry in the 21st century.", "Abstract": "To discuss potential advances in neuroscientific knowledge in the 21st century, enabling the realization of Freud's original vision of a basic biological science and an associated metapsychology.\nThe Australian Twin Study of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has demonstrated the high heritability of the core symptoms of ADHD, as well as showing important genetic and environmental influences on comorbid conditions.

Psychiatry under the Nazis and its contemporary relevance.", "Abstract": "In Nazi-occupied Europe, substantial numbers of psychiatrists murdered their patients while many other psychiatrists were complicit with their actions. This paper addresses their motivations and actions, and with particular reference to Australia, explores issues of contemporary relevance.\nThe events are reviewed in their historical context using mainly secondary sources.\nThe assumption that the term \"Nazi\" denotes a closed and unrepeatable chapter is questioned. As with the Holocaust that followed, medical killing of psychiatric patients was an open secret with gradations of collective knowing. Perpetrators were impelled by pressure from peers and superiors, unquestioning obedience, racist ideology and careerism. Perpetrators and bystanders' denial was facilitated by use of deceptive language, bureaucratic and technical proficiency, and notions such as \"a greater cause\" or \"sacred mission\". Dissociation and numbing were common. Psychiatrists were the main medical specialty involved because Nazi race and eugenic ideology (accepted by many psychiatrists) targeted mentally ill people for sterilization and euthanasia, and because psychiatrists were state-controlled and tended to objectify patients. Few psychiatrists resisted.\nNazi psychiatry raises questions about medical ethics, stigma and mental illness, scientific \"fashions\", psychiatry's relations with government, and psychiatrists' perceived core business. Psychiatric resistance to future similar threats should be based on commemoration, broad-based education and reflection on cultural values, strong partnerships between psychiatrists and patients, and willingness to question publicly policies and attitudes that disadvantage and stigmatize groups. The principle fundamental to all these practices is an orientation to people as subjects rather than objects."}, {"Title": "[Poverty and deficits in basis social supplies among inpatient psychiatric patients].", "Abstract": "People with psychiatric diseases are often afflicted by processes of social disintegration and social problems are of great importance for the treatment of the mentally ill.\nTwo departments of psychiatry and psychotherapy with obligatory service for their area - one in an inner city area of a large town with disadvantageous social structure, one in a small town with more favourable economic data - collected data during a two-months-period in 1998 according to the social situation of their patients.\n38,0 % resp. 31,9 % of the patients were living under conditions of poverty; 12,2 % resp. 11,5 % had acute housing problems, only 17,3 % resp. 31,7 % had some kind of payed occupation. Poverty was defined either as being dependent on public assistance or having an income below 50 % of the average. Patients with schizophrenic psychosis and patients with substance abuse related disorders formed in both departments the main groups and were at the same time those with the lowest income. Patients with substance abuse, mainly alcoholics, were more afflicted by social disintegration in the inner city area than in the small town sample.

In the activistic concept of NS-psychiatry, work became an obligation for patients and a criterion for selection that decided on life and death. Not until the late 1950s, there again was an orientation towards integration in psychiatric care in both German states. Whilst already in 1963 the \"Rodewisch Theses\" outlined recommendations for the rehabilitation of the mentally ill already in the GDR (East Germany), a similar mark of reform ideas was published in the \"enquete\" in the FRG (West Germany) in 1975. In the GDR initiatives were limited to a small number of locations. In the FRG and the re-unified Germany various forms of sheltered housing and work were established - also with significant regional variation. However, a clear discussion of underlying aims and implications for the structure of mental health care was not found in the psychiatric literature.\nIn the 20th century a tradition of psychiatric ideas related to housing and work did not develop in Germany. Particularly, there were only sporadic contributions from university psychiatry. Work was more frequently explicit subject of discussions than housing. Both areas were - slowly and in discontinuity - established as criteria of integration of people with mental illnesses, which was increasingly accepted as an aim of mental health care."}, {"Title": "[Caregivers' views of the treating psychiatrists: coping resource or additional burden?].", "Abstract": "This study aimed at investigating how caregivers of schizophrenic patients perceive the contact with mental health professionals and which are the key factors for their satisfaction or dissatisfaction.\n42 in-depth interviews were analysed with a view to discover the caregivers' experiences with psychiatric treatment.\nThe analysis of the interview data showed three fundamental areas in which caregivers perceive the contact with psychiatrists as supportive or troublesome: 1. the information about the disease and the treatment, 2. the long-term cooperation with the caregivers, and 3. the general way of behaving towards the caregivers and the patients. Caregivers' attitudes towards psychiatry are strongly influenced by positive and negative experiences they have had in these three fields.\nThe widespread criticism of caregivers is caused by dissatisfaction with central areas of psychiatric practice. Optimal treatment and consulting conditions, from the caregivers' perspective, can only be approximately achieved.

Continuing trends include the growing number of subspecialty programs, which increased by 65 since last year to 3822, and a smaller number of specialty programs, which decreased by 25 to 4203. There were corresponding shifts in the number of residents training in them. The number of graduates from osteopathic medical schools in allopathic GME has increased from 3288 in 1996-1997 to 4658 in 2001-2002, an increase of 42%. Overall, the total number of residents in GME has declined slightly, to an estimated 96 410 this year. The number of residents in graduate year 1 (GY1) positions (entry positions in GME, for which prior training is not required) has also decreased, although the proportion of residents in GY1 positions who have not had prior GME has increased. The number of international medical graduates (IMGs) in GY1 positions has decreased from a high of 6727 in 1999-2000 to 5898 in 2001-2002, a decrease of 12.3%.

We excluded studies where the service did not historically require face-to-face encounters (e.g. radiology or pathology diagnosis). A total of 58 articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles were summarized and graded for the quality and direction of the evidence. There were very few high-quality studies. The strongest evidence for the efficacy of telemedicine for diagnostic and management decisions came from the specialties of psychiatry and dermatology. There was also reasonable evidence that general medical history and physical examinations performed via telemedicine had relatively good sensitivity and specificity. Other specialties in which some evidence for efficacy existed were cardiology and certain areas of ophthalmology.

Standardized self-report, subjective rating, Daily Diary, and intrusive thought sampling measures were collected before and after treatment. Results indicated that participants in the eye fixation group reported marginally (p < .052) fewer cognitive intrusions than the non-directive group 1 week following treatment. No significant differences between the EMD and non-directive conditions or between the EMD and eye fixation conditions on this measure were found. During the treatment session, both desensitization groups were superior to the non-directive group in reducing reported vividness of the mental image of the original event. However, the non-directive group improved to the level of the two other groups by the following week. Rapid saccadic eye movements were therefore unrelated to immediate treatment effects for this sub-clinical sample, and non-directive treatment largely yielded eventual outcomes equivalent to the two desensitization conditions."}, {"Title": "[Seasonal affective depression in 2 German speaking university centers: Bonn, Vienna.

This is due to the fact that the enantiomers of many chiral drugs may have distinct pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacogenetic profiles. Consequently, in some instances there may be an advantage in using a single enantiomer over the racemic form-thus providing a basis for the development of new therapeutic agents, as well as the potential to improve current treatments. This review highlights some of the potential advantages and disadvantages that using single enantiomers might offer. The principles are exemplified through reference to the stereoselective properties of several established chiral psychotropic drugs, including thioridazine, methadone, trimipramine, mianserin, mirtazapine, fluoxetine and citalopram.

SPs were obtained during a task-performance feedback anticipation paradigm. The task consisted of a visual paired-associate memory test, with correct performance on single trials indicated by pleasant visual stimuli and incorrect performance by an unpleasant sound. We used realistic models of each subject's head based on their magnetic resonance images (MRIs) to estimate the potentials in the intracranial compartments and to define the source space using individual cortical geometry. Source reconstruction was performed by an Lp-norm minimization algorithm. Results showed a multifocal pattern of current density foci in various association cortices, including prefrontal areas 9 and 10 of Brodmann in all subjects. Posterior cortical areas also contributed importantly to the SP, for instance extrastriate area 19 and parietal area 7, in 90% of the subjects. According to our modeling, we conclude that even the pure stimulus-anticipation SP obtained here, as opposed to traditional motor-task contigent negative variation (CNVs), is not exclusively prefrontal in origin, being generated by multiple association areas.

This causes difficulties for referrers in choosing the appropriate clinic and for researchers in generalizing findings from one type of clinic to others. We randomly selected 37 outpatients attending an immunology fatigue clinic and 36 outpatients attending a psychiatry fatigue clinic, all of whom had chronic fatigue syndrome. We compared demographic factors, symptoms, disability, quality of life, psychological distress and illness attributions. The patients from the two clinics were closely similar in their specific symptoms, disability, quality of life, psychological distress and previous attendance to mental health professionals. Psychological distress was high and equal in the two samples. The proportion of men was greater among patients attending the immunology clinic. In a post-hoc analysis, 64% of immunology attenders attributed their fatigue to physical factors, compared with 31% of psychiatry clinic attenders (chi(2)=6.35, 1 d.f., P=0.01). These findings suggest that research data from one type of chronic fatigue clinic can be generalized to others. Clinically similar patients are referred to different clinics, and the choice of clinic may be influenced by the patients' illness beliefs. The high levels of emotional distress suggest that psychosocial management is as important as physical management in hospital outpatients with chronic fatigue syndrome, irrespective of its aetiology."}, {"Title": "Exposure to case management: relationships to patient characteristics and outcome. Report from the UK700 trial.", "Abstract": "Trials in community psychiatry must balance rigour with generalisability. The UK700 trial failed to find a significant effect on hospitalisation, but its sample population contained significant heterogeneity of exposure to case management in the two groups.\nTo test whether patients successfully exposed to a minimum of 12 months' intensive case management over the 2-year follow-up period achieved reduced hospitalisation.\nOf 679 participants with hospitalisation data, 84 were identified as having < 12 months' exposure owing to prolonged hospitalisation, imprisonment or a combination of the two. These patients were excluded and outcomes tested for the remaining 595 patients.\nOverall reduced case-load size did not reduce hospitalisation or treatment costs over 2 years despite elimination of outliers. Age, previous hospitalisation and source of recruitment to the study all correlated with outcome.\nCase-load reduction is not in itself enough to reduce the need for hospital care in psychosis. Baseline patient characteristics (in particular length of previous hospitalisation and recruitment from in-patient care) have a significant influence and should be allowed for in power calculations. Identifying the optimal clinical profile for patients likely to benefit from intensive case management remains a pressing need for further studies."}, {"Title": "Adult ADHD: a controversial diagnosis?", "Abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterised by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity with onset in children before the age of seven years. ADHD is the most common disorder presenting to child guidance clinics and has been shown to be a well-validated diagnosis. Current estimates of prevalence range from 1%5%. The concept of adult ADHD as a clinical entity is an emerging but controversial area in psychiatry. While childhood ADHD is accepted as a reliable and valid diagnosis, the validity of adult ADHD as a disorder is unclear. This paper reviews the likely presenting features of adult ADHD and common comorbid disorders. Guidelines for assessment and management are discussed and the evidence for validity of the diagnosis is critically examined."}, {"Title": "Irish Travellers and forensic mental health.", "Abstract": "To determine whether Irish Travellers are over-represented amongst transfers from prison to psychiatric hospital. If so, to determine whether this represents an excess over the proportion of Irish Travellers committed to prison.\nIrish Travellers admitted to the National Forensic Psychiatry service were identified from a case register over three years 1997-1999. New prison committals were sampled and interviewed as part of the routine committal screening to identify ethnicity.\nIrish Travellers accounted for 3.4% of forensic psychiatric admissions compared to 0.38% of the adult population. Travellers transferred from prison to psychiatric hospital had more learning disability and less severe mental illness than other groups, while black and other ethnic minorities had a higher proportion of severe mental illness. Travellers accounted for 6% (95% CI 3-11) of 154 male committals and 4% (95% CI 2-12) of 70 female committals. The estimated annualised prison committal rate was 2.8% (95% CI 2.4-3.3) of all adult male Travellers in Ireland and 1% for female Travellers (95% CI 0.8-1.3). Male Travellers had a relative risk of imprisonment compared to the settled community of 17.4 (95% CI 2.3-131.4), the relative risk for female Travellers was 12.9 (95% CI 1.7-96.7). Imprisoned Travellers had greater rates of drugs and alcohol problems than other prisoners (Relative risk 1.46, 95% C11.11-1.90).\nThere is gross over-representation of Travellers in forensic psychiatric admissions.

Part I of this paper examines the grounds for this connection while tracing the ramifications of bonding theory (Klaus and Kennell 1976) through obstetrics, pediatrics, and psychiatry, as well as in the (mis)representations of it in the popular media. This discussion resolves into a view of maternal attachment as a long-term development progressively established through intensive mother-infant interaction. The forms of this interaction are phylogenetically determined, albeit culturally and personally mediated. Flowing from this premise, Part II of the paper casts postpartum depression as an adaptive response to threat (from whatever cause) to adequate mothering, and develops an argument for the evolutionary role of enacted social ties in the establishment of maternal responsiveness."}, {"Title": "Work-related assaults on nursing staff in riyadh, saudi arabia.", "Abstract": "To determine the extent of work-related violence against nurses in hospitals in Riyadh.\nThrough a cross sectional approach, a self administered questionnaire was offered to 500 active-duty nurses selected randomly.

Construct validity, reliability of the empathy scale, and the differences on mean empathy scores by physicians' gender and specialty were examined.\nThree meaningful factors emerged (perspective taking, compassionate care, and standing in the patient's shoes) to provide support for the construct validity of the empathy scale that was also found to be internally consistent with relatively stable scores over time. Women scored higher than men to a degree that was nearly significant. With control for gender, psychiatrists scored a mean empathy rating that was significantly higher than that of physicians specializing in anesthesiology, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, radiology, cardiovascular surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and general surgery. No significant difference was observed on empathy scores among physicians specializing in psychiatry, internal medicine, pediatrics, emergency medicine, and family medicine.\nEmpathy is a multidimensional concept that varies among physicians and can be measured with a psychometrically sound tool.

While many reports on PKO have focused on political or sociologic considerations, the mental health of the peacekeepers themselves has received little attention and psychiatric problems that can have a negative impact on mission success have been largely ignored. Participation in PKO creates a number of stressors and serious psychiatric and/or physical disorders may result. Yet, there is little research on this topic, either domestically or globally, and the methodology for clinical intervention remains in an early stage of development. We have reviewed previous reports to determine how various stressors before, during and after deployment affect the participants. Research in associated fields (e.g. crisis workers and military personnel) are also reviewed and their application to peacekeeping psychiatry is discussed. It must be admitted that the significance of PKO is arguable and each PKO is unique in terms of the nature of its mission and the local situation. Yet, the relationship between the psychiatric status of the personnel and the characteristics of an individual mission has never been studied. At present, no clear consensus regarding a framework for psychiatric intervention exists.

This work is fundamentally dependent on fair and unbiased distribution of extramural research funds from the NIH. To date, no published report has examined the relative distribution of extramural support between departments of surgery and other major clinical departments.\nData regarding funding trends and peer-review activity were obtained from the NIH and compared between departments of surgery and four nonsurgical departments (medicine, psychiatry, pediatrics, neurology). Award data were examined during 1996 to 2001. Participation trends were examined during 1998 to 2000.\nSuccess rates of surgical proposals were significantly lower than nonsurgical proposals. Differentials in success rates were greatest for proposals assigned to the National Cancer Institute, although relative underfunding for surgical research spanned all major institutes. Awards for surgical grants averaged 5% to 27% less than nonsurgical grants). Surgeons exhibited 35% to 65% less peer-review activity relative to nonsurgeons when normalized to grant submission activity. Overall, surgeons participated on sections where they made up a relatively smaller proportion of total review members compared to nonsurgeons.\nSurgical grant proposals are less likely to be funded and carry significantly smaller awards compared to nonsurgical proposals.

In particular, depression has been reported to occasionally accompany diabetes mellitus. Here, we investigated depression onset in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Subjects were outpatients with a clinical diagnosis of depression in combination with diabetes mellitus between August 1, 1998 and September 30, 1998 of the psychiatry clinic of Jichi Medical School. Of 34 individuals (20 males, 14 females) included in the preliminary investigation, 22 were interviewed. We investigated the social demographic background, the treatment, family history of depression and diabetes mellitus, and measured the Hamilton's Rating Scale for Depression and the value of HbA1c. The overall male/female ratio was 13/9, indicating that this pattern of disease onset was more common in males than in females. The Hamilton's Rating Scale for Depression correlated closely with the percentage of patients being treated with insulin. Furthermore, the timing of the diagnosis of these two diseases correlated closely with each other. The ratio of males to females suggested that the different gender roles and lifestyles and the biological bases of these differences may play roles in the onset of depression among diabetic patients. Moreover, as more patients with insulin dependence developed depression than patients without insulin, insulin was implicated in the onset of depression. Furthermore, as the onset of the two diseases correlated closely with one another, the onset of one disease may have hastened the onset of the other."}, {"Title": "The molecular turn in psychiatry: a philosophical analysis.", "Abstract": "Biological psychiatry has been dominated by a psychopharmacologically-driven neurotransmitter dysfunction paradigm. The objective of this paper is to explore a reductionist assumption underlying this paradigm, and to suggest an improvement on it. The methods used are conceptual analysis with a comparative approach, particularly using illustrations from the history of both biological psychiatry and molecular biology. The results are that complete reduction to physicochemical explanations is not fruitful, at least in the initial stages of research in the medical and life sciences, and that an appropriate (non-reducible) integrative principle--addressing a property of the whole system under study--is required for each domain of research. This is illustrated in Pauling's use of a topological integrative principle for the discovery of the functioning of proteins and in Watson and Crick's use of the notion of a genetic code as an integrative principle for the discovery of the structure of genes. The neurotransmitter dysfunction paradigm addresses single molecules and their neural pathways, yet their interactions within the CNS as a whole seem most pertinent to mental disorders such as schizophrenia. The lack within biological psychiatry of an integrative principle addressing a property of the CNS as a whole may be responsible for the empirical failure of orthomolecular psychiatry, as well as for the central role that serendipity has played in the study of mental disorders, which is dominated by the neurotransmitter paradigm. The conclusion is that research in biological psychiatry may benefit from using, at least initially, some integrative principle(s) addressing a property of the CNS as a whole, such as connectionism or a hierarchical notion."}, {"Title": "The psychometric properties of the Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure in social anxiety disorder.", "Abstract": "The Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure (IPSM) was developed to assess hypersensitivity to interpersonal rejection, a suggested trait of depression-prone personality (Aust NZ J Psychiatry 23 (1989) 341). Although studies of the IPSM and interpersonal rejection sensitivity have primarily been conducted in depressed populations, it is important to investigate interpersonal rejection sensitivity as a relevant construct in the assessment of social anxiety. This study examined the psychometric properties of the IPSM in treatment-seeking individuals with social anxiety disorder. The results of this investigation support the convergent and divergent validity and internal consistency of the IPSM in socially anxious individuals. An exploratory factor analysis of the scale was also conducted after the original factor and subscale structure was shown to be a poor fit for the present data. Three factors emerged (Interpersonal Worry and Dependency, Low Self-Esteem, and Unassertive Interpersonal Behavior), and 29 items were retained. Because they demonstrated negative factor loadings on Factor 2, it is suggested that the scoring for four items of the original IPSM be reversed. In summary, the revised IPSM assesses three aspects of interpersonal rejection sensitivity and appears to be a valid and reliable instrument for its assessment in social anxiety disorder."}, {"Title": "[Utilization of methylphenidate(Ritalin) in France].", "Abstract": "Methylphenidate (Ritalin) is the only psychostimulant approved in France and indicated in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children over 6 years.

The authors analysed 220 cases of completed suicide committed in Krak\u00f3w and its environs in the year 2000. The material presented in the study was based on the archive data from post mortem examinations conducted in the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Krak\u00f3w. The sample consisted of 177 males and 43 females ranging in age from 13 to 89 years. The mean age was 43.6 years for the entire group, 42 years for males and 50 years for females.

Evidence from animal studies suggests that drug therapy may act on specific transcription factors and target genes that regulate processes such as neuroprotection and neuronal survival. Clinical studies consistently identify changes in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala that may be related to the course of illness and may be prevented with successful treatment. Together, these findings suggest that clinically relevant neurobiological correlations may ultimately be identified in patients who respond and remit to treatment. With these and future advances in the neuroscience of psychiatry, it may be possible to identify biological markers that will help in decisions about specific treatments for an individual patient."}, {"Title": "The concept of neuropsychiatry: a historical overview.", "Abstract": "The elusive nature of the social practice called neuropsychiatry is the most important obstacle for writing its history. At different times, and in different countries, the term has been used to name different ideological and professional packages. Choosing any of these as the prototype would, however, bias and regionalize the historical account. One solution is to identify an ideological marker or common denominator. To spin its yarn, this paper has chosen the foundational claim (putatively common to all practitioners of 'neuropsychiatry') that all 'mental disorders are disorders of the brain'. Three among its results are worth noting. One is that the meaning and exercise of 'neuropsychiatry' will continue to depend on social, economic and political factors; this augurs future instability. The second is that each time that the foundational claim has been uttered in history it has meant something different. Further research is needed to clarify whether this is due to the way in which the claim becomes 'inscribed' in different cultural niches; what is clear is that by using the foundational claim as a marker it is not possible to establish a continuity in the progress of neuropsychiatry. The third finding is that users of the foundational claim require the use of a concept of matter and in this paper 'plain' and 'baroque' types of matter have been identified. To explain the origin of mind, those using the plain notion need to resort to external ingredients and their narratives incorporate bits of the real world.

Only the PP under discussion is able to meet the demand of clinical psychiatry to provide a reasonably reliable description of symptoms and syndromes, upon which rational diagnosis and adequate prevention and treatment can be based. The overly objectifying psychiatry of Kraepelin has been overcome by the descriptive-analytic and understanding PP in the direction of Jaspers and Schneider, aiming more at the elucidation of the patients' own inner experiences than at the observation of behaviour and expression. It is shown that important concepts, findings and results of the classical and recent psychiatry could be obtained by means of the PP, developed by representatives of the German speaking clinical psychiatry and psychology. PP has to take the lead previous to all other basic sciences, relevant for our discipline, also because it is not a self-contained theory, but an open approach, based on methodological reflection, showing ways for research. If the maxime \"phenomenology is prior to genesis and interpretation\" is ignored, or, if this PP is confused with and mistaken for philosophical phenomenology, the results of such a procedure must be doubtful. An intense training and thorough adoption of PP, the \"phenomenological attitude\" of the physician is urgently demanded as well by German speaking as recently also by anglophone psychiatrists. The substantial influence of the \"phenomenological attitude\" on psychology and sociology of clinical practice, on the atmosphere of a psychiatric hospital and the style and kind of psychiatric research, due to the fact that the psychopathologist can do practical and scientific work only with the patient and in very close relation with the patient, is also meaningful in order to avoid faulty developments.

Nor may they be able to give an account of their duration. Hence, the pattern of manifested depressive symptoms is likely to vary according to age and stage of development of the child and young adolescent, and this is probably related to concept and language development. Further, distress and negative affect may be expressed by externalising symptomatology, especially in the pre-school years.

Psychosocial stressors have been shown to be related to the onset of anxious episodes. Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) are involved in regulating stress responses. The sensitivity of PBR to acute or chronic stress has been demonstrated in various situations. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is one of the longest standing and most frequently used measures of anxiety. The development, evaluation, and use of biological markers with anxious conditions in psychiatry are extremely important.\nThe aims of this survey are to see whether PBR can be used in screening the degrees of anxiety which occur when normal persons are placed in the stressful conditions.\nTwenty-four healthy volunteers (14 men, 10 women; mean age 46 years) participated in this study. We administered the STAI to all the volunteers. The binding of the radioactive PBR antagonist [(3)H]PK 11195 to platelet membranes was determined for these volunteers.\nThe mean STAI scores were 40.3+/-8.0 for trait anxiety and 39.0+/-8.9 for state anxiety. B(max) of the platelet PBR binding was 2845+/-2109 fmol/mg protein. Pearson correlational analyses revealed that B(max) values were significantly and positively correlated with scores for trait anxiety but not significantly correlated with scores for state anxiety.\nPBR on platelets are correlated with trait anxiety scales of the STAI in healthy normal subjects.

PNI brings together researchers in a number of scientific and medical disciplines, including psychology, the neurosciences, immunology, physiology, pharmacology, psychiatry, behavioral medicine, infectious diseases, and rheumatology. All are scientists with profound interest in interactions between the nervous and immune systems, and the relation between behavior and health. Despite the variety in domains and approaches to research, the outcome common to all research endeavors is the discovery of new information, of uncovered facts, of novel evidence, which contributes to the continuing generation of knowledge. In this paper we discuss psychoneuroimmune aspects of some conditions that are not routinely immediately associated with immunity, such as the condition of being the caregiver of somebody suffering from dementia; the effect on the brain-body modulations of aluminum, a metal that is not a component of the human body; and insomnia, a fairly common but disturbing disease, that even today lacks an effectual treatment."}, {"Title": "The paradoxical use of interpreting in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Changes in the official status of African languages in South Africa suggested an examination of the impact of multi-lingualism on the practice of institutional psychiatry. For a range of theoretical and institutional reasons, a 'language gap' between clinician and patient can be rendered irrelevant in terms of the routine production of psychiatric texts in which 'symptoms' are described and 'cases' are constructed. In contrast to the way in which the role of interpreting is obscured in some hospital settings, it is highlighted in forensic settings. Here the extent of the dependency of the clinician on the interpreter is made more visible. Through this ethnographic exploration of the institutional management of multi-lingualism, the status of 'the patient who requires interpreting' emerges as an institutional construct, being determined in large measure by the routines of institutional practice. The requirements of the institution that the patient move through the process of a hospital admission, and the different requirements of each stage of this process, inform the decision as to whether interpreting is necessary. Furthermore, the differing requirements of the members of the multi-disciplinary teams renders the status of 'the patient who requires interpreting' as variable and contested. Through this analysis the institutional management of multi-lingualism emerges as a site at which discourses of race in psychiatry are reproduced."}, {"Title": "Posttraumatic stress disorder and the structure of common mental disorders.", "Abstract": "Krueger [1999: Arch Gen Psychiatry 56:921-926] identified a three-factor structure of psychopathology that explained the covariation or grouping of common mental disorders found in the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) [Kessler et al., 1994: Arch Gen Psychiatry 51:8-19]. These three fundamental groupings included an externalizing disorders factor and two internalizing disorders factors (anxious-misery and fear). We extended this research through the examination of additional data from a large subsample of the NCS (n=5,877) that contained diagnostic information on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Factor analytic findings revealed that PTSD showed no affinity with the fear factor defined by panic and phobic disorders, and instead loaded on the anxious-misery factor defined primarily by mood disorders. An identical pattern of results emerged for both lifetime PTSD and 12-month PTSD prevalence figures. Implications of these findings for the classification of PTSD and research on its etiology are briefly discussed."}, {"Title": "Access to a community aged psychiatry service by elderly from non-English-speaking backgrounds.", "Abstract": "With the ageing of Australia's ethnic communities, aged mental health services need to examine issues pertaining to accessibility and appropriateness in the context of this sociodemographic change. The aim of this review of referrals to a community aged-psychiatry service was to compare for differences between patients from non-English-speaking backgrounds (NESB) and English-speaking backgrounds (ESB).\nSociodemographic and clinical variables were retrospectively collated for a 12-month period and analysed according to NESB and ESB status. The 1996 Australian Census data were used for comparison of catchment area representation of different ethnic groups.\n40.8% of patients referred to the service were from NESB, and 78.8% of these were assessed with an interpreter. Taken as broad ethnic groups, the referral of elderly European migrants was similar to their representation in the local population, while elderly migrants from Asia and other non-European backgrounds were under-represented. Sociodemographic differences were found in that the elderly from NESB were more likely to be poorly educated, have a low proficiency in English, and to have been employed in unskilled occupations. On the other hand, patterns of referral, diagnosis, past psychiatric history and outcome did not differ significantly between the two groups. Clinical variables relating to referral source, past psychiatric history, and outcome did not differ significantly across the two groups.\nThis 12-month review of referrals to an aged psychiatry community service found that nearly half were of elderly patients from NESB. The lower utilisation of the service by certain ethnic groups may reflect obstacles in their pathway to care. Alternatively, strong family networks, or a lower prevalence of mental illness in these elderly, may explain the findings in this report."}, {"Title": "Sleep disturbances associated with minor psychiatric disorders in medical students.", "Abstract": "We performed a cross-sectional study with 342 medical students (age range, 18-35 years) to identify, among a group of sleep disturbances, those which are related to minor psychiatric disorders in this population. The instruments employed for data collection were the self-reporting questionnaire (SRQ-20), the morningness/eveningness questionnaire, the Epworth sleepiness scale, and a general questionnaire regarding demographic characteristics, use of drugs, history of psychopathology, usual fall-asleep time, usual wake-up time, amount of sleep, arousal during the night, and insomnia. We used a logistic regression model to determine independent factors associated with minor psychiatry disorders.

We carried out a pilot randomised controlled trial, the first we believe into this type of care, of one such model; enhanced liaison with individual patients by key workers, in general practices in Paddington and North Kensington in London.\nAll patients referred from primary to secondary psychiatric care from four general practices over a 10-month period, and still in contact with services, were eligible to be included in the study. The practices were allocated in a constrained randomised procedure to either normal care or enhanced key-worker liaison. The latter involved encouraging individual key workers to adopt improved communication between primary and secondary care. Baseline assessments of symptomatology and social functioning were made before randomisation and after 6 months by an independent researcher.\nOf the 84 eligible patients, 43 were seen at baseline and 34 re-assessed after 6 months. There was no difference between the clinical outcomes in the two groups but self-rated social function was significantly improved in the enhanced liaison service compared with standard care (adjusted P = 0.05). Costs were similar but somewhat more expensive for enhanced liaison. Less than half (42 %) of all key workers in the enhanced liaison arm felt they had involved the primary health care team more in the care of their patient, with 21 % of these altering their practice markedly during the study.\nIt is concluded that without additional resources enhanced key-worker liaison for psychiatry in primary and secondary care has limited benefits although this does not necessarily apply to other forms of liaison practice."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric education: a survey of Greek trainee psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "This survey investigates psychiatric trainees' attitudes regarding specific educational fields, in order to detect possible divergence from the priorities specified by the European Board of Psychiatry (EBP).

For the analysis of data, we used descriptive statistics, correlations, and one-way analysis of variance.\nDespite the variance which existed, the majority of trainees considered nearly all the fields in question as essential for their training, with great priority given to psychopharmacology and biological psychiatry by 91.7% and 91.4% of the trainees, respectively. On the other hand, we found that stage of training, gender, training centre and medical school of graduation played an important role in the formation of the trainees' priorities.\nThe investigation of trainees' attitudes towards educational fields in psychiatry can be very useful in the development of a training plan, and at the same time constitute a valuable index for monitoring the responsiveness of training programmes to the European guidelines for psychiatric training."}, {"Title": "The flunitrazepam abuse prevention program at a general hospital in Taiwan: a descriptive study.", "Abstract": "The Bureau of Controlled Drugs at Ministry of Health, Executive Yuan in Taiwan announced, on 1 April 2000, the schedules of controlled drugs with abuse potential and implemented a policy on 1 October 2000 to control them. Flunitrazepam (FM2), along with other two benzodiazepines (triazolam and brotizolam), is placed on Schedule III. The aim of the present study was to analyze the pattern of flunitrazepam prescriptions across all medical subspecialty departments at Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang Hospital (TMU-WFH), Taiwan. We analyzed 1170 prescriptions over 12 month period from 1 July 2000 to 31 May 2001. All prescription data were divided into three 4 month periods: period I was when the flunitrazepam prescription was not controlled, period II represented the time when flunitrazepam was placed on Schedule III and when physicians were required to use a special duplicated prescription form and period III was when the TMU-WFH started to set a stricter control for the prescription of flunitrazepam. The results indicated that the number of flunitrazepam prescriptions during period III had decreased significantly compared with period I (P < or = 0.05). Eventually, 45.7% of flunitrazepam-medicated patients were followed up monthly with a restriction of their flunitrazepam supply to no more than 14 days, 22.9% of patients were followed up fortnightly at clinics with a 14 day supply of flunitrazepam, 15.7% were followed up fortnightly with a 14 day restriction of flunitrazepam plus a non-flunitrazepan benzodiazepine supplement, 10.7% were referred to clinics within the Department of Psychiatry and 5% were switched from flunitrazepam to other drugs."}, {"Title": "[Psychosomatic research in primary health care--ideal concept and reality].", "Abstract": "The cooperation between research institutions and primary care doctors can be seen as a possible model for practical research in psychosomatic medicine.

Anticholinergic properties offer a faster approach to monitoring pharmacodynamic intraindividual effects of the drug by measuring their effects on heart rate variability (HRV), which is sympathetically and parasympathetically controlled via cholinergic synapses. The plasma concentrations of the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine correlated with parameters of HRV in 59 patients suffering from schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. HRV during 4 minutes at rest was extracted from the ECG trace of a routine digital EEG registration in addition to blood sampling for plasma concentration measurement (HPLC method). We calculated sympathetically and parasympathetically controlled heart frequency bands (low, medium and high frequency) and other HRV parameters, coefficient of variation (CV), and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD). All HRV parameters were significantly more impaired in clozapine patients (n = 33, mean clozapine plasma concentration 331 +/- 294 ng/ml) than in olanzapine patients (n = 26, mean olanzapine plasma concentration 42 +/- 32 ng/ml) and demonstrated 1.7 - 4.8 times the cardiac anticholinergic properties of clozapine in vivo. 14 out of 14 patients with a CV beyond 3.2 % had clozapine plasma concentrations below the proposed optimal therapeutic concentration of 350 ng/ml. All HRV parameters were inversely and significantly correlated with the clozapine plasma concentrations (such as lgCV: r = - 0.73, p < 0.001) and, to a lesser extent, with the olanzapine plasma concentrations (lgCV r = - 0.44, p < 0.05). These results underline the potential clinical value of HRV parameter extraction from routine ECGs in predicting plasma concentrations and objective individual neurocardiac effects of drugs with anticholinergic properties."}, {"Title": "Teaching pharmacology within a multidisciplinary organ system-based medical curriculum.", "Abstract": "We have described how the pharmacology of agents that act on the central nervous system (CNS) and endocrine system were incorporated into a case-based, multidisciplinary, integrated sophomore medical curriculum at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSM). Faculty members from the Departments of Pharmacology, Pathology, Internal Medicine, Psychiatry, and Neurology were major participants in the CNS block, and faculty with primary expertise in radiology, epidemiology, and immunology also participated. Integrated sessions involving the entire class were organized around brief patient cases, which were given to the students in advance of the session. During the sessions, each patient case was presented by a physician or pathologist who briefly described symptoms, history, physical findings, differential diagnosis, and the classification of the subtypes of the particular class of disorder. The pathophysiology of the disease was discussed, and the pharmacology of agents to be considered for therapy was presented in the context of the Pharmacology Mental Algorithm, a systematic and rational approach to drug therapy. The session was completed by a clinician who added further clinically relevant information, which was followed by a question-and-answer period involving all faculty participants. The CNS block was presented over a 1-month period and included standardized patients and real patients who consistently exhibited specific disease findings, and these patient-oriented sessions were followed with small group tutorial sessions. Single discipline large-group sessions were also used to present material that is introductory or unique to a particular discipline. Student knowledge was assessed, using integrated evaluations based on case vignettes with multiple-choice questions provided by each discipline. The goal of the examination was to evaluate knowledge base in the discipline areas and its application to clinical problem-solving. A practical evaluation of each student's patient examination skills in CNS was also performed by clinicians. Feedback from the students on the organ system activities was obtained using a questionnaire. Development of these sessions required leadership and a considerable amount of time to organize, improve, and update sessions. The integrated approach largely eliminated the use of conflicting terminology and redundancy of material common with separate presentations on the same subject by different disciplines. The multidisciplinary, case-based sessions were perceived to be instructive, valuable learning experiences, based on formal and informal student and faculty feedback."}, {"Title": "Clinical applications of pharmacogenetics in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Pharmacogenetic research has identified response-related mutant variants in metabolic enzymes and drug-targeted receptors. Allelic variants of dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors have been associated with clinical outcome and adverse events such as movement disorders. Deficient metabolic enzymes have been related to drug accumulation and toxic events. This information will help to design safer and more efficient drugs. However, the field is moving rapidly towards a new goal: the application of pharmacogenetics as a clinical tool for the prediction of treatment outcome. The first studies in this direction have proved the feasibility of using genetic information for the prediction of response to antipsychotic drugs and to treatment of Alzheimer's disease. New strategies investigating genes related to specific symptoms and side-effects have produced encouraging results that can contribute to the improvement of the levels and accuracy of the predictions.

It is critically important to obtain more information on the effectiveness of medications over time for patients who initially responded to pharmacotherapy for panic disorder.\nLong-term outcome was examined for 78 patients who attained a 2-month period of sustained remission on medication and received maintenance pharmacotherapy for up to 24 months during the Massachusetts General Hospital Longitudinal Study of Panic Disorder, a prospective, naturalistic study. Participants were categorized by their maintenance treatment condition at remission: benzodiazepine alone (N = 45, 58%), antidepressant alone (N = 12, 16%), and combined treatment with a benzodiazepine and an antidepressant (N = 21, 27%).\nApproximately half (N = 36, 46%) of the patients who had achieved remission relapsed at some time over the 2-year naturalistic study period, despite continued and adequate pharmacotherapy. There was no difference in timing or frequency of relapse by type of maintenance pharmacotherapy.\nInterpretation of the data is limited by the naturalistic nature of the study, and by the relatively low sample size.\nThis data suggests that patients with panic disorder have a high rate of relapse even after acute response to pharmacotherapy, despite continued treatment.

In Japan, the department name \"Department of Psychiatry\" (in Japanese, Seishin-ka) itself evokes the lay public's and psychiatric patients' feelings of stigma. This phenomenon may hamper psychiatric treatment of adequate duration and quality. On July 1st, 1999, the Juntendo University Hospital changed the department name from \"Department of Psychiatry and Neurology\" (in Japanese, Seishin-Shinkei-ka) to Mental Clinic, accompanied by an increased number of new outpatients, as reported previously. In the present study, we turn our attention to the opinions of those patients who have received treatment in the department under both names. Questionnaires asking for their opinions about the department names revealed that the majority have feelings of stigma associated with the name \"Department of Psychiatry and Neurology.\" This result did not correlate with demographic factors or the length of psychiatric treatment. However, those who experienced psychiatric admission were significantly less uncomfortable with the name than those who did not. It was also revealed that the change in the name lessened their feelings of stigma and negative self-image as patients of a general hospital.

Sociodemographic variables, relative consultation rates, reasons for referral and psychiatric diagnoses, apart from a shift from adjustment disorders with depressed mood to major depressive disorders within the depressive syndrome group, did not demonstrate significant changes during the study period. Levels of psychosocial and somatic functioning of referred patients decreased. Changes occurred in the pattern of C-L-psychiatric recommendations, e.g., in the prescription of antidepressants where tricyclic antidepressants were replaced by newer agents such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Consulting psychiatrists were more likely to refer to private psychiatrists to follow patients, and more patients were transferred to inpatient psychiatric units.

American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.", "Abstract": "The insanity defense is a legal construct that excuses certain mentally ill defendants from legal responsibility for criminal behavior. This practice guideline has delineated the forensic psychiatric evaluation of defendants raising the insanity defense. The document describes acceptable forensic psychiatric practices. Where possible, standards of practice and ethical guidelines have been specified. And where appropriate, the practice guideline has emphasized the importance of analyzing the individual case, the jurisdictional case law and the state (or federal) statute. This practice guideline is limited by the evolving case law, statutory language and legal literature. The authors have emphasized the statutory language of current legal standards, as well as the state or federal courts' interpretation of those standards because the same statutory language has been interpreted differently in different jurisdictions. Similarly, this practice guideline has reviewed the state and federal trends that determine which diagnoses meet the criteria for mental disease or defect. These trends yield to jurisdictional court interpretations. Finally, the authors hope this practice guideline has begun the dialogue about formulating a forensic psychiatric opinion by surveying the various approaches used to analyze case data. The forensic psychiatrist's opinion in each case requires an understanding of the current jurisdictional legal standard and its application, as well as a thorough analysis of the individual case. The psychiatrist's analysis and opinion should be clearly stated in the forensic psychiatric report. It should be noted that the role of a psychiatric expert witness in the criminal justice system is predicated on the law's interest in individualizing the criteria of mitigation and exculpation.

Answers to the central sociological question of how social arrangements affect mental health might require the development of explicitly sociological outcome measures. This introduction provides an overview of several issues that arise in grappling with this question. These include whether symptom scales or diagnoses best capture the mental health consequences of social arrangements; when single or multiple outcomes are necessary to compare the consequences of social arrangements across different groups; if sociologists should explore the positive as well as the negative consequences of social forces; and when sociological attention should be directed toward social-level as well as individual-level outcomes.

It is generally due to the 47,XXY genotype, ie one extra X chromosome in each cell. Its estimated frequency among newborn boys is 1/500 to 1/700. It seems that 64% KS would be undiagnosed. Abnormally low levels of testosterone blood values are very common in this syndrome. In this case, replacement androgen therapy should be initiated (ideally at the age of 11-15) which prevents osteoporosis and enhances secondary sexual features. Case report - Since early childhood, Mr X has been shy, passive with few friends. When he was 13 years old, the school physician noted a delay of puberty and referred him to an endocrinologist who diagnosed KS. Androgen therapy was introduced but rapidly stopped, because the boy and his parents thought it was useless. Mr X consulted a psychiatrist at the age of 21. He presented a schizo-affective disorder with influence syndrome, auditory and visual hallucinations, labile mood with disinhibited and depressive periods. He was admitted in a psychiatry ward of a general hospital. An endocrinologist confirmed the diagnosis of KS and found very low blood testosterone levels. Besides lithium and risperidone which had already been introduced before the hospitalization, androgens (testosterone undecanoate) were very progressively given to Mr X with a daily psychiatric evaluation. One month after discharge, a major depressive episode led to the adjunction of citalopram. After one year of follow-up, Mr X shows increased social adjustment and enhanced interest; the influence syndrome has partially regressed and his mood is more stable. Discussion - In the years '60 and '70, systematic screenings in psychiatric hospitals have detected 1.3% KS among hospitalized boys, ie 10 times more than in the general population, and 0.6 to 1% KS among hospitalized men. A large variety of psychiatric disorders have been described. Boys presenting KS are usually described as shy, with little energy and initiative, and few friends. They cry more often than compares. Neuropsychological studies demonstrate significantly lower verbal IQ than controls, while performance IQ is generally normal and global IQ is in the normal range with large individual variations. Language acquisition is always delayed. However, agressiveness is not increased. In his follow-up study of 20 years, Nielsen at al found more psychiatric disorders among KS patients, compared to a group of hypogonadal patients at first examination (mean age=27 years). After 20 years follow-up, however, no significant difference remained between the two cohorts concerning the frequency of psychiatric hospitalizations or mental diseases. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain psychological aspects of KS such as low levels of androgens during foetal and child development, personality disorder related to hypogonadism, delay of mitosis of cells with an extra X chromosome, but none of them is able to explain the specificity of psychological problems associated with KS. Concerning therapeutic aspects, specialists prone substitutive androgen therapy in case of too low testosterone blood levels, from the time of increase in FSH (around the age of 11-15). It prevents osteoporosis, backache and excessive tiredness often found in males with KS; testosterone also improves social drive, mood, concentration and ability at work. If KS diagnosis is made at adult age, androgen therapy has also shown some efficacy, though less than if started earlier. Due to the oral and written language problems of KS boys between 5 and 12 years of age, Graham et al. recommend anticipatory guidance for these boys. In addition, they insist on the importance of the information of the parents, language therapy, the reduction of the length of the instructions given by schoolmasters and specially stimulating and stable childhood conditions. Though it is generally thought that androgens increase agressiveness, we found no consistent data in litterature proving that the restoration of physiological androgen blood levels increases crimes nor aggressiveness. In the contrary, Miller and Sulkes described four cases of KS men presenting chronic fire-setting behaviors. Testosterone was introduced. For three of them, follow-up was available: their behavior seemed improved and none of them recurred. However, the initiation of androgen therapy for patients with severe psychiatric illness should be done very carefully. Conclusion - The Klinefelter's syndrome is frequent and, if not diagnosed (which seems to be the most common case), these men have higher risks to develop psychiatric disorders. Therefore, child psychiatrists and psychiatrists should evoke that diagnosis when they examine boys or men who present typical physical traits of KS (tallness, underdevelopped testes) associated to school problems and/or psychiatric disorders. Indeed, if the diagnosis is confirmed by an endocrinologist and a genetic testing, psychological follow-up and testosterone undecanoate treatment (in case of abnormal testosterone blood levels) should be initiated. This therapy generally improves physical well-being and improves mood, concentration, capacity at work. There is no consistent data in the litterature proving that restoring physiological testosterone blood levels would be dangerous for KS men presenting severe psychiatric troubles.

Nonsignificant trends included female sex (OR 4.1; 95%CI, 0.89 to 18.6); alcohol abuse (OR 2.1; 95%CI, 0.71 to 6.2); behaviour problems (OR 1.9; 95%CI, 0.71 to 5.2); and chronic cognitive impairment (OR 1.4; 95%CI, 0.55 to 3.8). Although living situation with nonspouse family, friends, or others and marital status of widowed, divorced, or separated were significantly associated with abuse when examined in separate logistic regression models, both were nonsignificant when examined together, suggesting collinearity. Both were retained in the model because they probably represent different aspects of vulnerability. The final model included living situation with nonspouse family, friends, or others (OR 6.1; 95%CI, 0.75 to 49.5) and widowed, divorced, or separated marital status (OR 2.4; 95%CI, 0.21 to 26.8). Nonsignificant trends included female sex (OR 2.6; 95%CI, 0.45 to 14.4); alcohol abuse (OR 2.2; 95%CI, 0.59 to 7.9); and lowest quartile on the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale (GAF < 35; OR 2.0; 95%CI, 0.64 to 6.0).\nThe practical implications of our study are that elder abuse and neglect are common among patients referred to geriatric psychiatry services, that such services should have access to multidisciplinary expertise and resources to deal with abuse, and that certain situations may signal higher risk. In our setting, the situation of living with nonspouse family, friends, or other persons in a nonsupervised setting and a history of family disruption by widowhood, divorce, or separation were significant correlates of abuse. Suggestive but nonsignificant trends of potential importance (OR > or = 2.0) included female sex, alcohol abuse, and lowest quartile of functional status.

A review of the prescription privilege debate for psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "The debate over whether clinical psychologists should be granted the right to prescribe psychoactive medication has received considerable attention over the last 2 decades in the US, but there has been relatively little discussion of this controversial topic among Canadian mental health professionals, namely psychologists and psychiatrists. Proponents of prescription privileges (PPs), including the American Psychological Association (APA), argue that psychologists do not and cannot function as independent professionals because the medical profession places many restrictions on their practice. It is believed that PPs would help circumvent professional psychology's impending marginalization by increasing psychology's scope of practice. Proponents also argue that PPs would enhance mental health services by increasing public access to professionals who can prescribe.\nThe purpose of this article is to inform psychiatrists about the major arguments presented for and against PPs for psychologists and to discuss the major implications of PPs for both professional psychology and psychiatry.\nWe conducted a literature search of relevant articles published from 1980 to the present appearing on Psychlit and Medline databases, using \"prescription privileges\" and \"psychologists\" as search titles.\nAlthough proponents present several compelling arguments in favour of PPs for psychologists, pilot projects relating to feasibility and efficacy are either sparse or incomplete. Thus, it is too soon to tell whether PPs could or should be pursued. Clearly, more research is needed before we conclude that PPs for psychologists are a safe and necessary solution to psychology's alleged impending marginalization."}, {"Title": "The dimensional symptom structure of schizophrenia and its association with temperament and character.", "Abstract": "Recent studies suggest that personality may influence symptom expression and social functioning in schizophrenia. This study investigated the relationships between personality and symptom dimensions in schizophrenia patients. Fifty-two schizophrenia patients and 25 five healthy subjects were assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). The patients were also assessed for positive and negative symptoms using SAPS and SANS and scored according to Andreasen's (1995: Andreasen, N.C., Arndt, S., Alliger, R., Miller, D., Flaum, M. 1995.

Revisiting the factor structure for positive and negative symptoms: evidence from a large heterogeneous group of psychiatric patients. Am. J. Psychiatry, 154, 371-377). Comparisons between patients and controls revealed significant differences on various TCI scores consistent with a global disorganization of personality in schizophrenia involving both basic neurophysiological and potentially genetically determined traits (i.e. temperament) and developmental aspects of personality (i.e. character). Correlation analysis showed distinct associations between symptoms and personality dimensions. The results suggest that the negative and disorganized dimensions of schizophrenia are related temperamental factors, whereas the psychotic symptoms are more related to characterological abnormalities. The observed patterns of associations also underline the heterogeneity of the classical negative and positive dimensions of schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "[Miguel Gayarre (1866-1936) and neurology in Madrid: a contribution to his biography].", "Abstract": "Miguel Gayarre y Espinal (1886-1936) is considered to be, together with Ach\u00facarro, one of the most scientifically influential persons on Lafora, and hence on the so-called Madrid Neurological School preceding the Spanish Civil War (late XIX and first third of the XX century). There is, however, a great deal of scarcity about personal biographic data on Gayarre. We document herein that Gayarre, after graduation, achieved his doctoral degree at the age of 29 by discoursing on a non-neurological subject (On essential paroxysmal tachycardia).

Significant relationships between CYP2D6 genotype and steady-state concentrations have been reported for perphenazine, zuclopenthixol, risperidone and haloperidol when used in monotherapy. Other CYPs, especially CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, also contribute to the interindividual variability in the kinetics of antipsychotics and the occurrence of drug interactions. For many antipsychotics, the role of the different CYPs at therapeutic drug concentrations remains to be clarified. Some studies have suggested that poor metabolisers for CYP2D6 would be more prone to oversedation and possibly parkinsonism during treatment with classical antipsychotics, whereas other, mostly retrospective, studies have been negative or inconclusive. For the newer antipsychotics, such data are lacking. Whether phenotyping or genotyping for CYP2D6 or other CYPs can be used to predict an optimal dose range has not been studied so far. Genotyping or phenotyping can today be recommended as a complement to plasma concentration determination when aberrant metabolic capacity (poor or ultrarapid) of CYP2D6 substrates is suspected. The current rapid developments in molecular genetic methodology and pharmacogenetic knowledge can in the near future be expected to provide new tools for prediction of the activity of the various drug-metabolising enzymes.

The questionnaires were sent to wards, patients and psychiatrists and were returned by 72.2% overall. The number of admissions per ward was calculated as 21 patients per one month, and comprised half of all admissions to the hospital. 50% were schizophrenia, 17% were affective disordes and 16% involved drug abuse. Seventeen patients were discharged from PWAT per one month, and comprised 43% of all patients discharged from the hospital. These results indicate that both 21 patients admitted and 17 patients discharged per month and needs to maintain the essential standard for PWAT and the standard should be come more flexible as admission from the other unit of ward than PWAT. As rate of re-admission within 3 months after discharge was around 10% of the total number of patients in the ward, 3 months was considered suitable length of acute treatment in the field of psychiatry in Japan. There was one psychiatrist working in PWAT, and specialized psychiatrists had 17.4 patients, the most number of patients among types of psychiatrist. Simulations of one psychiatrist to 16 and to 32 patients in PWAT were performed to determine how many psychiatrists were needed for a ward. When the ratio was 32 patients to 1 psychiatrist, it was necessary to increase the number of psychiatrists to a ward by 1, and in the case of 16 patients, 1-3 psychiatrists were needed. These indicate the standard number of psychiatrists for PWAT should be at most one psychiatrist for the ward or all of the psychiatrists working in PWAT should be allowed to work simultaneously in other wards. Preparing wards to treat acute phase psychiatric patients is a very important role of each psychiatric hospital, the standard for PWAT should include not only a high level of medical staff, but also preparing easy criteria for each hospital."}, {"Title": "[Use of positron emission tomography in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "For the past years, substantial amount of experimental data has been published on the use of positron emission tomography in different psychiatric disorders.

For each study the best available depression measure was taken as the index measure of depression outcome. Predetermined criteria were established to assist in the ranking of measures. Where authors reported categorical outcomes we calculated individual and pooled odds ratios for the odds of improvement in treated compared with control subjects. For continuous outcomes pooled effect sizes were calculated as the number of standard deviations by which the change in depression scores for the treatment group exceeded those for the control groups.\nThirteen trials (involving 506 participants) were included. No overall improvement with treatment compared to placebo was seen for children or adolescents (odds ratio = 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.25). A statistically significant but small benefit of treatment over placebo was seen in reducing symptoms (effect size (standardised mean difference) = -0.31, 95% confidence interval -0.62 to -0.01). Subgroup analyses suggest a larger benefit among adolescents (effect size = -0.47, 95% confidence interval -0.92 to -0.02), and no benefit among children (effect size = 0.15, 95% confidence interval -0.34 to 0.64).

Tetracyclics and MAOI/RIMAs were used significantly more often than tricyclics in the more severely physically ill and the elderly. The percentage of patients prescribed an antidepressant increased significantly over time, which is accounted for by the greater use of SSRIs across all age groups and degrees of seriousness of illness.

The gold standard of psychiatric treatment is to treat the underlying medical cause and use high-potency antipsychotics to treat the clinical manifestations of delirium. In the early 1990s, a new generation of novel antipsychotics was developed. Their mechanism of action, preferential serotonergic (5HT(2a)) blockade, results in a markedly lower rate of extrapyramidal side effects, an advantage over the typical, older antipsychotic medications. These agents have been shown to be effective and well tolerated in common psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia or bipolar disorder), but few studies have evaluated them in the treatment of delirium.

A belated commemoration on the 50th anniversary of his death].", "Abstract": "The 50th anniversary of the death of Theodor Ziehen was on December 29, 2000. As this occasion passed without fanfare, it is the authors' intent to recollect his importance in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry.\nA short description of his life and an evaluation of his scientific work is presented based on earlier publications.\nZiehen (1862-1950) was an extraordinarily versatile scholar. He is regarded as a great psychiatrist, psychologist and philosopher, as well as one of the founding fathers of child psychiatry. He began work on developmental psychiatry in Jena, publishing his first article \"Association Psychology in Childhood\" in 1898. He worked in close collaboration with the educators Rein and Tr\u00fcper. In 1902 the first part of his book \"Mental Diseases in Childhood\" was published, followed by further publications in 1904 and 1906. These volumes are regarded as the second most important in child psychiatry in Germany. His work is the first systematic and almost complete compendium in this field. Ziehen introduced the medical terms \"affective psychosis\" and \"psychopathic constitution\" to psychiatric literature. He also worked in the fields of medical education and education."}, {"Title": "Family physicians and psychiatrists.

During the past 15 years considerable effort has been expended in trying to establish the genetic loci associated with susceptibility to these and other mental disorders using principally linkage analysis. Despite this, only a handful of specific genes have been identified, and it is now generally recognized that further advances along these lines will require the analysis of literally hundreds of affected individuals and their families. Fortunately, the emergence in the past three years of a number of new approaches and more effective tools has given new hope to those engaged in the search for the underlying genetic and environmental factors involved in causing these illnesses, which collectively are among the most serious in all societies. Chief among these new tools is the availability of the entire human genome sequence and the prospect that within the next several years the entire complement of human genes will be known and the functions of most of their protein products elucidated. In the meantime the search for susceptibility loci is being facilitated by the availability of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and by the beginning of haplotype mapping, which tracks the distribution of clusters of SNPs that segregate as a group. Together with high throughput DNA sequencing, microarrays for whole genome scanning, advances in proteomics, and the development of more sophisticated computer programs for analyzing sequence and association data, these advances hold promise of greatly accelerating the search for the genetic basis of most mental illnesses while, at the same time, providing molecular targets for the development of new and more effective therapies."}, {"Title": "Happy birthday neuroleptics! 50 years later: la folie du doute.", "Abstract": "Given that we are celebrating the 50th birthday of neuroleptics introduction in psychiatry, the author proposes to take a look at certain results related to therapeutic practice. After a brief chronological literature review of the clinical practices and theoretical models that have controlled drug treatment of schizophrenia, the author presents a critical review of four meta-analyses. Since Delay, Deniker and Harl's initial report, the story of neuroleptics comprises several periods. In 1963, the hyper-dopaminergic theory of psychoses was proposed. Another period began with models mainly based on the serotonin/dopamine relative blockade receptor hypothesis. More recently, a new framework to understand the differential effect of antipsychotics is related to the appropriate modulation (e.g., fast dissociation) of the D2 receptor alone. The concept of atypicality has become a new vista for research and to market new compounds. However, after 50 years of neuroleptic drugs, are we able to answer the following simple questions: Are neuroleptics effective in treating schizophrenia? Is there a difference between atypical and conventional neuroleptics? How do the efficacy and safety of newer antipsychotic drugs compare with those of clozapine? Actually, the answers yielded by these simple questions by meta-analysis should elicit in us a good deal of humility. If we wish to base psychiatry on evidence-based medicine, we run a genuine risk in taking a closer look at what has long been considered fact. Each psychiatrist must continue to be critical, sceptical, optimistic (not overoptimistic) and to learn in order to integrate the positive aspects of our growing knowledge base."}, {"Title": "Criminal responsibility and cannabis use: psychiatric review and proposed guidelines.", "Abstract": "An evaluation of the criminal responsibility of an offender who has consumed cannabis necessitates knowledge of the effect of the product on the offender's mental state at the time of the alleged offense. However, the effects induced by cannabis are numerous and the forensic psychiatrist should base his diagnosis and his evaluation on facts which are as objective as possible. A selective literature review, using the computerized databases Medline, Psychlit and Embase, has been carried out to aid evaluation from a forensic psychiatry point of view. Biological means of cannabis detection, and the difficulties associated with using them to understand the clinical effect that the product has on any one user, are shown. Eight major categories which can be used in the domain of forensic psychiatry are detailed in this review: Acute usual effects, acute adverse effects, mood disturbance, acute toxic confusion, acute psychotic reaction, chronic paranoid psychosis, amotivational syndrome or other long term effects, and flashbacks. For each of these categories the effects of cannabis intoxication on cognitive and volitional capacities are analyzed, and guidelines for the evaluation of criminal responsibility are proposed."}, {"Title": "[Diagnosis related groups (DRG) in child and adolescent psychiatry: results of a prospective pilot study].", "Abstract": "Germany faces one of the biggest 'revolutions' in the health care system. As decided by the government in cooperation with medical boards and insurances, beginning with January 1st, 2003 all inpatient treatments will be paid on the basis of adapted Australian-Refined Diagnosis Related Groups. To date, hospitals are requested to obtain prospective databases in order to cluster homogeneous diagnostic groups and calculate realistic treatment-costs. Both psychiatry and child and adolescent psychiatry are so far excluded from the introduction of DRGs. However, most experts predict extensive shifts of patients into psychiatry (i.e. with comorbid internal diseases) under the pressure of short treatments in all non-psychiatric disciplines. Therefore, changes in the payment of psychiatric treatments are inevitably. As part of the DRG pilot-study, we created a catalogue adapted to child and adolescent psychiatry, which was used for 102 consecutively treated inpatients of a child and adolescent hospital. A total of 17.019 prospectively assessed procedures were obtained. Under clinical aspects, 11 categories of 'typical' disorders were analysed. Worst predictability of treatment costs was found for obsessive-compulsive disorders, personality disorders, and eating disorders.

In children with clinically significant emotional/behavioral problems, bilingual language skills were strongly and inversely correlated with problem scores, particularly global problems (r = -0.67, p < .001); social, thought, and attention problems (r > or = -0.54; p < .004); delinquency (r = -0.66, p < .001); and aggression (r = -0.52, p < .01). These correlations remained significant after IQ adjustment.\nPrior findings from monolingual children were confirmed in this bilingual sample, namely (1) the high prevalence of mixed receptive-expressive and other language disorders and delays and (2) the close tie between poor language skills and emotional/behavioral problems. The data strongly suggest the clinical importance and feasibility of language assessment and the significance of receptive problems in bilingual children referred for psychiatric services. A safe approach is to fully assess language skills, rather than misattributing these children's language delays to normal bilingual acquisition processes."}, {"Title": "[The epilepsypsychoses].", "Abstract": "The association of epilepsy, the epilepsypsychoses and schizophrenia has attracted the attention of psychiatrists and neurologists since the nineteenth century.

J. Psychiatry, 153 (1996) 321]. It is unclear whether cognitive dysfunction is related to specific areas of functioning in schizophrenia, such as coping abilities. Individuals with schizophrenia have deficient coping skills, which may contribute to their difficulties dealing with stressors [Am. J. Orthopsychiatry, 62 (1992) 117; J. Abnorm. Psychol., 82 (1986) 189]. The current study examined the relationship between coping abilities and cognitive dysfunction in a community sample of individuals with schizophrenia. It was hypothesized that executive dysfunction and mnemonic impairments would be positively related to deficiencies in active coping efforts involving problem solving and self-initiation (e.g. advocating for oneself and others with mental illness and becoming involved in meaningful activities, such as work), independent of the contributions of the general intellectual deficits associated with the disorder and psychiatric symptoms. The results indicated that both executive dysfunction and mnemonic impairments were related to decreased usage of active coping mechanisms after controlling for general intellectual deficits. Further, recognition memory made independent contributions to the prediction of coping involving action and help seeking after controlling for the effects of negative symptoms. These findings suggest that individuals with schizophrenia may be less flexible in their use of coping strategies, which may in turn contribute to their difficulties in coping with mental illness and its consequences."}, {"Title": "Assessment of a consultation-liaison psychiatry and psychology health care program.", "Abstract": "To investigate the relevance of subjective criteria adopted by a psychiatry and psychology consultation-liaison service, and their suitability in the evaluation of case registries and objective results.\nSemi-structured interviews were conducted and all supervisors of the university hospital service were interviewed.

The EMEA recommends clinical trials to detect a difference between the compound under investigation and placebo, and to assess at least non-inferiority against an active comparator. A placebo arm is intended to validate the study. The EMEA supports the use of placebo only when there is no serious risk for the patient. In schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder the Agency suggests that a three-arm study is the design of choice, to demonstrate superiority against placebo and a similar balance against an active comparator.\nDespite the many effective therapeutic options available for the pharmacological management of psychiatric disorders, the EMEA regulatory process still relies on the demonstration of efficacy in absolute terms, against a placebo.

The intentional drive and guidance mechanisms are organized through a ventral, respectively, a dorsal cortical-subcortical circuitry.\nA deficient implementation of these mechanisms at the limbic domain manifests itself as schizophrenia, whereby the heterogeneity in symptomatology is explained by the extent of the remaining cerebral activity and by the degree of indirect activation of these systems. In general, activation manifests itself as positive symptomatology and the absence of such activation as negative symptomatology. The model provides a more comprehensive explanation for existing clinical and epidemiological data than do the current alternatives. It is compatible with the major prevailing views on the illness, such as the theories that regard this as a progressive neurodevelopmental, or a connectivity disorder, or one resulting from a deficient cerebral lateralization, or an interrupted cortico-thalamo-cerebello-cortical circuitry.

The CPPS unit titled \"Geriatric Clinical Psychopharmacology\" was written for third- and fourth-year medical students; residents in psychiatry, family practice, and internal medicine;fellows in clinical pharmacology; and those studying for boards in clinical pharmacology. The CPPS unit \"Anisocoria and Glaucoma\" was written for more advanced students of clinical pharmacology. The CPPS unit titled \"Antiepileptic Drugs\" was intended for second-year medical students. The second teaching clinic was held in November 1993 and focused on the development and editing of the CPPS units and their evaluations by faculty and students from academic centers.

At the follow-up, patients with only partial weight recovery had a BMD loss of 3.2% at lumbar spine and 6.4% at femoral neck, whereas patients with total weight recovery had an increase of 7.8% at lumbar spine and 6.7% at femoral neck.\nThe risk of osteopenia in male adolescents with anorexia of more than 12 months' duration is high. In patients with total weight recovery, BMD increase is higher than normal."}, {"Title": "Emergency/Adjunct services and attrition prevention for randomized clinical trials in children: the MTA manual-based solution.", "Abstract": "Treatment studies in child and adolescent psychiatry are increasingly characterized by long-term, multisite, randomized clinical trials (RCTs). During the course of these RCTs it is common for clinical exigencies to emerge that require rapid, direct intervention. The challenge is to provide clinically appropriate responses that do not contaminate the delivery, distinctness, and interpretation of the treatments under investigation. In multisite studies, the problem is compounded by the need to minimize cross-site differences in the delivery of adjunct treatments. Such minimization requires fully operationalized and manual-based procedures for clinically mandated intervention. The NIMH Collaborative Multisite Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)--\"the MTA\"--is a long-term multisite collaborative study in which children with ADHD were randomly assigned to either medication management, behavioral treatment, the combination, or community-comparison assessment and referral. In designing its study, the MTA developed a manual-based set of procedures (the MTA Adjunct Services and Attrition Prevention [ASAP] Manual) for situations not covered by the protocol treatments. The majority of cases requiring adjunct services fell into two major categories: (1) crisis/emergent situations and (2) imminent risk of attrition. This report describes the ASAP guidelines for dealing with cases that required adjunct services that the MTA Steering Committee adopted before initiating the trial. Although the manual-based guidelines are especially applicable to multisite RCTs, many of the procedures in the ASAP Manual can apply to any treatment study in children."}, {"Title": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders (CRSD) in psychiatry--a review.", "Abstract": "Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders (CRSD) are a group of sleep disorders characterized by a de-synchronization between a person's biological clock and the environmental 24-hour schedule. There are four main types of CRSD, namely, Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) (the most common), Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (ASWD), Non-24-hour Sleep-Wake Syndrome (Free-Running Pattern) and Irregular (or Disorganized) Sleep Wake Pattern. These disorders lead to harmful psychological and functional difficulties and certain personality disorders may also be related to them. It has been found that psychotropic drugs, SSRI and haloperidol can cause CRSD, and this is also true for some cases of minor head trauma. They are often misdiagnosed and incorrectly treated due to the fact that many doctors are unfamiliar with them. This review describes the disorders, their consequences and available treatment."}, {"Title": "[Capacitive requirement for acute in-patient care of patients with psychosomatic diseases in bavaria].", "Abstract": "Estimations of the requirement for acute in-patient care of patients with psychosomatic diseases in Bavaria have to rely on respective data on their incidence and prevalence as valid requirement data are missing. The required capacity of in-patient beds depends on several, inconsistently figured parameters: hospitalization rate, length of stay, occupancy rate. Based on conservative assumptions the hospitalization rate was calculated to be at least 1.3 admissions per 1000 and for adequate treatment the average length of stay should not be limited to less than 50 days. In order to avoid unnecessary delay of treatment a realistic occupancy rate has to be 90 %. Thus the minimal capacity for in-patient care is assessed to be 2453 beds. At present patients with psychosomatic diseases in Bavaria receive in-patient treatment in psychosomatic departments of general hospitals, hospitals and rehab clinics of psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic medicine, and in hospitals of psychiatry and psychotherapy, in each with a different focus. When the expertise was drafted these acute care and rehab hospitals provided some 2500 beds - with only 76 beds in general hospitals. For quality assessment of the available beds for in-patient care and future planning minimal standards of structural quality have to be consented. At present it is not possible to make a clear and substantial distinction between the treatment for patients with psychosomatic diseases in acute-care hospitals and in psychosomatic rehab clinics respectively. Thus, the necessary in-patient rehab capacity can only be assessed roughly. The existing pluralism of the in-patient care providing system for patients with psychosomatic diseases is considered to be appropriate for different needs of this patient group. In the future excellent care for this patient group will acknowledge options for a more flexible and interconnected care-providing system.

Students' knowledge, attitudes, and confidence were assessed immediately before and after the interclerkship. In addition, during 1998-99, each student's clinical skills in SA assessment and intervention were evaluated at the completion of the student's six-week psychiatry clerkship using objective standardized clinical examinations (OSCEs) with two simulated patients, one with and one without active SA issues. Students who took the psychiatry clerkship in the first half of the year had not yet participated in the interclerkship. Students' pooled performances before and after the interclerkship were compared.\nStudents' attitudes toward and knowledge about SA disorders and their confidence about SA assessment and intervention all showed significant positive changes immediately after the interclerkship. The OSCE performance data demonstrated a significant sustained improvement in clinical skills in SA assessment and intervention as measured up to six months following the interclerkship.\nThese data suggest that brief intensive training in SA during the clinical years of medical school can have a positive and lasting impact on students' clinical performances."}, {"Title": "Just say no to psychotropic drugs!", "Abstract": "Prescribing drugs for mental disorders by psychologists means accepting an invalid model--the brain disease, biological-defect explanation of psychopathology--that is advanced by political conservatives and accepted by some naive, well-intentioned, but misinformed moderates who have not thought critically about the issue.

This is not well-known either in Germany or even in Per\u00fa or seems to be forgotten. The basis of it was the influence of German philosophy of the 19(th) and 20(th) centuries. A review is being given of the work of those that we consider to have been the pioneers of the German thought in these disciplines in Per\u00fa: Juan (Giovanni) Copello, Hermilio Valdiz\u00e1n (1885 - 1929), Dora Mayer (1868 - 1959), Enrique Encinas (1895 - 1971), Pedro Zulen (1889 - 1925), Honorio Delgado (1892 - 1967), Walter Blumenfeld (1882 - 1967), and some of their pupils. Without these it would not have been possible to advance in the knowledge, neither would it had been possible to set the basis for a national psychology and psychiatry. Due to the development of the American theories that cropped up in the fifties and invaded the theoretical field as much as the practical one in both, psychology and psychiatry, this era has come to an end.

The purpose was to compare their understanding of what their responsibility entailed as well as their perceptions of goals and required competence. A content analysis, supplemented with interpretations within a hermeneutic tradition, showed that there are both similarities and differences within and between the two organizations. A common finding is that professionals with the least education are to a great extent responsible for the practical care of persons with long-term mental illness.

Since some of the medications used in psychiatry have been implicated, an extensive review of available literature was made of the major classes, including antipsychotics, antidepressants, lithium, anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines. Further, where no publications were found on a particular medication, the pharmaceutical firms responsible for these items were contacted concerning possibly unpublished data. Results of the survey indicate that there may be difficulty in one of three situations: immediate (in the first minutes to hours after oral or parenteral administration), short-term use of 4 - 12 weeks or long-term use of 6 months. Based on this approach, the greatest concern is directed at the immediate application of haloperidol, droperidol, pimozide and trazodone, the short-term use of thioridazine, pimozide, sertindole, nortriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin and the long-term use of clozapine, olanzapine and carbamazepine. It is of interest that a reduction in QTc is reported with aripiprazole. Among the antidepressants, the tertiary tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine, amitriptyline and doxepin) appear to have a more general impact, while the secondary tricyclic antidepressants (nortriptyline, desipramine) may impact more on children and the elderly. Among other antidepressants, the only reports of torsades de pointes appeared to occur with mirtazapine. It was also of interest to find data showing no effect or reductions in QTc produced by sertraline, citalopram, paroxetine and bupropion in multiple studies. Effects of medications on other heart parameters are also briefly reviewed. In particular, the safety of sertraline in post-MI patients and of bupropion in heart disease patients is highlighted. Little information was available on other classes of medications used in psychiatric disorders. What is available concerning lithium, the anticonvulsants and the benzodiazepines indicates little effect on the QTc, although there may be effects on other cardiovascular parameters."}, {"Title": "Estrogen replacement therapy in the treatment of major depressive disorder in perimenopausal women.", "Abstract": "Increased vulnerability to mood disorders has been reported during perimenopause. Fluctuating estrogen levels accompany the perimenopausal transition. Thus, estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) has been proposed as a potentially effective treatment for mood disorders occurring during perimenopause.\nWe examined the efficacy of ERT in the treatment of depression in 16 perimenopausal women with DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder who were participating in the Mood Disorders Research Program at the Department of Psychiatry of the University of California, Los Angeles. Ten antidepressant- and ERT-naive women received ERT alone. Six women who were nonresponders or partial responders to an antidepressant received ERT in addition to existing treatment with fluoxetine. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) was administered to all patients at baseline and weekly thereafter during the 8-week open-protocol trial. Partial response was operationalized as a final HAM-D score < or = 50% of the baseline score. Remission was defined as a final HAM-D score < or = 7.\nAll patients exhibited clinical improvement as measured by HAM-D scores after the first week of treatment. Of the 10 perimenopausal depressed women receiving ERT alone, 6 remitted, 3 partially responded to treatment, and 1 did not respond by the end of the trial. Of the 6 women receiving antidepressant treatment with ERT, 1 patient remitted and 5 had a partial response by the end of the trial.\nThis small study suggests that for some antidepressant-naive perimenopausal women with clinical depression, ERT may have antidepressant efficacy.

In Tourette's syndrome, the absence of evident brain pathology resulted in vacillation between organic and functional explanations and persistent controversy about the nature of the illness.\nNeurology and psychiatry have, for much of the past century, been separated by an artificial wall created by the divergence of their philosophical approaches and research and treatment methods. Scientific advances in recent decades have made it clear that this separation is arbitrary and counterproductive.

Only about one in five people seen by a psychiatrist report the psychiatrist as the only mental health care provider. Disadvantaged areas of the cities and remote areas, when compared with the least deprived areas of the cities, showed lower rates of utilization. This effect is stronger in psychiatry than in other specialties. Patients seeing psychiatrists seem to be a more satisfied group than those seeing only other providers; nonetheless, some needs are not well met, and the role of the psychiatrist cannot be isolated as the cause of this satisfaction.\nMost care delivered by psychiatrists is de facto shared care. Psychiatrists as clinical professionals need to be continually mindful of the need to communicate with others providing care.

Sex-specific differences in prevalence rates and symptomatology of psychiatric disorders may also be better understood if divergent problems of adaptation for men and women in human evolutionary history are taken into account. Instead of mistaking the evolutionary approach for being deterministic and empirically untestable, it may rather be appropriate to provide a functional classification which adds to the contemporary psychiatric nosology through analysis according to specific conflicts of adaptation (at the ultimate level), the pursuit of biosocial goals, and proximate specifiers such as genetic, developmental, and interpersonal causes of disorders."}, {"Title": "The relationship between insomnia and health-related quality of life in patients with chronic illness.", "Abstract": "To determine the association between insomnia and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with chronic illness after accounting for the effects of depression, anxiety, and medical comorbidities.\nWe used a cross-sectional analysis of Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) data.\nThe sample consisted of 3445 patients who completed a self-administered questionnaire and who were given a diagnosis of 1 or more of 5 chronic medical and psychiatric conditions by an MOS clinician.

Both scales showed adequate properties in terms of: a) discriminant validity (MADRS/HARS-Clinical Global Impression: p < 0.001); b) convergent validity (MADRS-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale: p < 0.05 and 0.01; MADRS/HARS-EuroQoL 5D: p < 0.05; HARS-State Trait Anxiety Inventory: p < 0.05); c) internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: MADRS = 0.88; HARS = 0.89); d) test-retest and inter-raters reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient: MADRS = 0.94 and 0.98, respectively; HARS = 0.92 and 0.92), and, e) sensitivity to change (effect size: MADRS = 2.05; HARS = 1.36).\nSpanish versions of MADRS and HARS scales showed good psychometric properties, similar to those of the original scales.

In the mid twentieth century, psychiatrists' emergence from ideological confinement in asylums, where they were separated from urban culture and medicine in general, finally allowed them to benefit from accumulating knowledge and technological progress in the field of medicine. After its transition from a custodial to a therapeutic discipline, psychiatry has acquired a variety of new fields of action and duties that require a high degree of expertise on psychological and biological levels. At the same time, people have increasingly come to expect relief not only from disease, but also from manifold problems of everyday life. As a consequence, there has been an inflationary growth of professional psychiatric and psychotherapeutic and nonprofessional services. The professional requirements that psychiatrists should meet have also increased quantitatively and qualitatively in the wake of the historical change from a caring, paternalistic attitude towards the mentally ill to a therapeutic partnership. To a greater degree than physicians working in other medical fields, psychiatrists get personally involved with their patients. As a consequence, the mental burden of their profession is at times immense. For this reason, the ethics of a medical profession has special implications for psychiatrists. The fascinating advances in therapeutic methods, neurobiological knowledge, and the increasingly differentiated diagnostic tools, e.g., noninvasive investigation of the morphology and functioning of the brain, have turned psychiatry into one of the most interesting contemporary professions. Psychiatry is now facing an enormous challenge of meeting the standards of expertise."}, {"Title": "A Canadian experiment: the Institute of Neurosciences, Mental Health and Addiction.

It uses the principle of inductance to generate a magnetic current, which in turn activates cortical neurons. Stimulation is highly focused and interests specific regions of the cerebral cortex. This therapeutic technique is generally well tolerated. Side effects are rare, the most hampering one is epileptic seizures. It is favored by high frequencies (above 5 Hz) and arises mainly with patients having a history of personal or family epileptic seizures. The first open trials, quickly confirmed by controlled studies showed the efficiency of TMS in depression. With depression, double blind randomized trials, using high frequencies, stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex give positive results with significant decrease of scores on depressive scales applied to resistant and non resistant depressions. Some studies have stimulated the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using low frequencies. The decrease of scores is also significant on depressive scales. The modulating effect of rTMS on cortical excitability of the brain justifies this distinction between high and low frequencies, high frequencies having a facilitating effect whereas low frequencies have an inhibitory effect."}, {"Title": "[Amnesic presentations of the compulsive obsessional confusions (about 3 patients appearing in a consultation of memory)].", "Abstract": "Disorders or complaints of memory are a frequent cause of consultation in depression, major anxiety and psychiatry disease with personality disorders. We report 3 patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), without diagnosis and treatment, examined in a specialized memory consultation. They always had OCD with cognitive checking. Diagnosis of transient global amnesia and temporal complex seizure were discussed in 2 cases. Psychometric impairment only was observed in first free recall of a verbal memory task and was no specific. Behavioural during testing seemed to be very important to analyse. First, a 49-year-old man consulted because he had stereotyped transient amnesia lasted one minute, 2 or 3 times a week, since 6 months. He was a teacher. Transient amnesia always occurred during lessons. Suddenly he didn't know where he was or what he was speaking about. Episodes lasted one minute. After them, he had no confusion and no difficulty in concentration but intense anxiety. In an another hand, when he was in his car, after lessons, he could forget where he was during some minutes. CT scan and EEG were normal. Neuropsychological tests only objectived impairment in first free recall of Grober and Buschke's words. Patient explained that he could not prevent to check responses. He told us checking obsessive compulsive disorder during since long time ago. We discussed clear differences which existed between seizure and ruminations or preoccupations. Secondly, a 55-year-old woman was afraid of her memory performances. She was medical secretary and had no problem in her work but she would like a memory consultation to reassure herself. She was neither depressed nor anxious. She presented curious production in fluency task. She had to produce as many animals's names as possible: she could say 35 names which was an excellent performance but only in alphabetic order! Neuropsychological tests objectived impairment in her first free recall of Grober and Buschke's words. She tried in her first free recall to remember words in alphabetic order. She explained how she was bound to range everything in alphabetic order! She had a lot of rituals. She thought that she had an obsessive compulsive disorder but never consulted about this. The observation illustrated suspiscions about memory operations which could be observed in patients group with obsessive compulsive disorders. Finally, a 62-year-old man told us that he had presented a transient global amnesia during 4 hours. He had an important appointment and was upset about that. He didn't go to it and wandered in his flat. He always asked the same questions and forgot everything. He had no neurological deficit. He was anxious, sad and cried several times. He perfectly remembered the episod and thought that he had a panic attack! Verbal memory tests only objectived difficulties in his first free recall of Grober and Buschke words as the two others patients. He had a story of obsessive compulsive disorder with checking and rituals. In this observation, we discussed clear differences which existed between panic attacks and global transient amnesia. We analyzed patterns of neuropsychological performances which illustrated clinical features of obsessive compulsive disorder. These three patients impaired in their first free recall of verbal memory task. It is not a specific result. We observed during psychometric evaluation, strategic processing which impaired episodic memory: patients tried to check their performances. Memory complaints only were observed in checking obsessive compulsive disorder. It is a difficulty or a doubt about memory capacities. Difficulties could be due to particular cognitive processes who pertubate normal memory capacities."}, {"Title": "[Pharmaco-epidemiological study on antipsychotic drug prescription in French Psychiatry: Patient characteristics, antipsychotic treatment, and care management for schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "In 2000, a one week national survey was conducted among 202 psychiatrists (129 participants) in France, from hospitals and clinics, private or public. The first 20 inpatients and 10 outpatients prescribed at least one antipsychotic drug (age range 18-65), were included. The diagnostic procedure was standardized with a structured interview: the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). A total 2 068 patients were included, among whom 892 (43.1%) reached the criteria of schizophrenia according ICD-10. We present here data on these latter patients. Mean age was 38.8 years; with 38.8% females. Median duration of current antipsychotic treatment was 0.5 year in inpatients and 2 years in outpatients. Median duration of any antipsychotic treatment was 10 years, without difference between groups. Comorbid situations (anxiety disorder, depression and suicidal risk) were found in 33.1% of schizophrenic patients, with higher frequency among inpatients in private hospitals (54.8%) than in other groups. 46.8% patients were prescribed at least 2 neuroleptics, and 73.6% at least one non-neuroleptic drugs. Cyamemazine accounted for 16.6% of all neuroleptics drugs, and 56% of patients were prescribed an atypical antipsychotic (risperidone, olanzapine, amisulpride or clozapine). Atypical drugs accounted for 59.4% of patients who were prescribed only one neuroleptic drug. Inpatients had more neuroleptics coprescription than outpatients (mean 1.8 vs 1.4 drugs), with higher daily dose. In addition, inpatients had more other psychotropics prescribed (mean 1.5 vs 1.1 drugs). Overall, more other psychotropic drugs were prescribed among patients with -, than those without - comorbid situations (1.7 vs 1.2 drugs). Median time since admission, at the time of the study, were similar in private and public hospitals (107 vs 99 days) but maximal time since admission was respectively 2.8 and 48.9 years. Visit frequency for outpatients was more than one every two weeks for 43.1% in private and 24.7% in public clinics. Among inpatients only we found a difference between private and public hospitals for polypharmacy of non neuroleptics psychotropics, (mean 1.9 vs 1.5). In outpatients, long acting depot accounted for 26.6% of neuroleptics treatments in public clinics and 15.4% in private clinics. Finally, we found that polypharmacy among outpatients increased with duration of antipsychotic treatment.\nin France, important differences are reported in antipsychotic prescription for schizophrenia between in- and outpatients. Current antipsychotic prescription is more recent in inpatients than in outpatients, with similar duration of overall antipsychotic treatment. Inpatients have more drug prescription, antipsychotics and other psychotropics, than outpatients. Differences are less important between private and public providers. Inpatients in private hospitals receive more non neuroleptic drugs than in public hospitals, and depot antipsychotics are more used among patients of public clinics. Long term inpatients are found in public hospitals only. Outpatients follow up is more intensive in private than in public clinics."}, {"Title": "Fraternal birth order and birth weight in probably prehomosexual feminine boys.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to confirm a previous finding that homosexual males with older brothers weigh less at birth than do heterosexual males with older brothers. The subjects comprised 250 feminine boys referred to a child psychiatry service because of extreme cross-gender wishes or behavior and assumed, on the basis of previous research, to be prehomosexual, plus 739 control boys and 261 control girls referred to the same service for reasons unrelated to sexual orientation or gender identity disorder and assumed, from base-rate probabilities, to be preheterosexual. The feminine boys with two or more older brothers weighed 385 g less at birth than did the control boys with two or more older brothers (P = 0.005). In contrast, the feminine and control boys with fewer than two older brothers did not differ in birth weight. This finding suggests that the mechanism by which older brothers increase the odds of homosexuality in later-born males operates prior to the individual's birth. We hypothesize that this mechanism may be immunologic, that antimale antibodies produced by human mothers in response to immunization by male fetuses could decrease the birth weight of subsequent male fetuses as well as increase their odds of homosexuality."}, {"Title": "RITE performance predicts outcome on the ABPN Part I examination.", "Abstract": "This study examined the performance correlation the American Academy of Neurology Resident Inservice Training Examination (RITE) and Part I of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) examination.\nCandidates who took the RITE in the last year of training were tracked and their subsequent performance on the ABPN Part I examination was compared with their performance on the RITE.\nPerformance on the RITE is predictive of performance on the ABPN Part I examination.\nThe RITE can be used to assess a resident's readiness to take the ABPN Part I examination."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry and HIV].", "Abstract": "Are there specific psychiatric issues in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that force us to modify our typical model of care delivery in most communities? This appears to be the case. Most of these issues stem from the fact that the HIV-positive population has a high prevalence of a variety of psychiatric disorders. The integration of the psychiatric treatment with general medical treatment improves psychiatric and medical outcomes. Along this lines, how con understanding personality types improve our ability to prevent and treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Some people are far more likely to indulge in risky behavior than others. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic is driven by high-risk behaviors that are often associated with psychiatric disorders. Because of this, psychiatrists have an important role in the treatment and prevention of HIV. Furthermore, the current treatment for HIV requires strict adherence to complicated regimens, and untreated psychiatric disorders are a major barrier to effective treatment. Individuals who are \"unstable\" and/or \"extroverted\" make up the greatest group of patients in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) clinics. Understanding the dynamics of their character leads to better therapeutic approaches in their treatment.

During the court hearing the term 'psychopathic personality' was used in relation to Stewart and, following this and other similar cases, the average man or woman could be forgiven for believing that psychopathy is inextricably linked with dangerousness and criminality. In the light of the Government consultation paper entitled Managing Dangerous People with Personality Disorder. Proposals for Policy Development and the Government White Paper Reforming the Mental Health Act -- Part II: High-risk patients, this article proposes that whilst studies conducted with incarcerated psychopaths will continue to increase our knowledge and understanding of criminality, non-incarcerated psychopaths have an arguably equal potential to illuminate our understanding of the emotional difficulties, such as lack of empathy and lack of conscience, which underlie psychopathy and which lead to offending behaviour. Although a range of obstacles have hindered progress in this field of study, this paper proposes that developing an understanding of the nature of the emotional difficulties of the psychopath, unconfounded by criminality, has the potential to make a valuable contribution to the field of child psychiatry in ways which have implications for mental health nurses and society as a whole. It theorizes that if the psychological constructs which underlie psychopathy were better understood, children who display those emotional difficulties could be more accurately identified and strategies be generated which carry the ultimate aim of minimizing the risk of those children developing the offending behaviour associated with psychopathy."}, {"Title": "[Value of a consultation center and crisis intervention in addressing psychiatric disorders in the perinatal period].", "Abstract": "The Psychiatry department of the University Hospital Centre of Lille has developed, over the last 10 years, a treatment network for psychiatric disorders during pregnancy or in the post-partum period. There are liaison consultations in the maternity department, screening and management of psychopathological disorders in the perinatal period, training of midwives, support of patients seeking genetic counselling, collaboration with teams providing \"medically-assisted procreation\", etc. For severe disorders of the post-partum period (severe depression, serious alteration of mother-child interaction, puerperal psychosis), the Psychiatry department has a specialized unit where 3 \"mother-child\" groups can be admitted. This unit is particularly effective if the patients and their family understand this healthcare system and stick to it to a certain extent. Even if improvements are always possible, cases in which situations occur as an emergency, are when dysfunctions are most frequently seen. On 7th December 1998, a Crisis Intervention Unit (CIU) was created with 15 short-term beds, for stays up to 72 hours. The CIU was opened in the Psychiatry department, close to the main Accident and Emergency department, with 2 aims: firstly to provide a setting and resources for a number of emergency psychiatric situations, and secondly to provide a place and time for crisis situations which we admit to the unit, with a view to facilitating interaction and to propose in certain cases a process of crisis intervention, which later continues on an outpatient basis. After being open for a year, the CIU has proved to be an improvement to all of the healthcare services which are available. It should be noted that the situations which need highly specialized resources in such a short time, are those which cause the most acute problems. This is at times when the emergency services network, with its internal logic, require another network based on a different logic, that the interface problems are at their most acute. The situations reported here, which require a fluid interface between the emergency services and the \"mother-child\" networks, are examples. We report 3 clinical situations, which illustrate 3 possibilities of action: the first, in which 2 successive stays in the CIU allowed an admission to the \"mother-child\" unit in satisfactory conditions, the second, in which overall management was based on hospitalization in the Obstetrics department and several visits to our Unit, and the last one, in which the whole medico-psycho-social approach was set up after a single stay of 3 days. Since the opening of Crisis Intervention Unit, around 1,000 patients have been treated there; 37 were women with difficulties with their pregnancy, 17 of whom required direct intervention by the \"mother-child\" team. The contexts were: 5 prenatal depressions, 4 post-partum depressions, 3 cases of hyperemesis gravidarum, 5 rejections of pregnancy and/or situations at risk of infanticide. The almost constant suicidal risk should be noted, or even attempted suicide, at the time of admission to the CIU. The other 20 women had psychopathological disorders linked to sterility, medically-assisted pregnancy, termination of pregnancy or pregnancy in women suffering from long-term somatic illnesses (insulin-dependent diabetes, lupus, etc.). When a psychopathological episode occurs during pregnancy, it is essential to preserve the developing relationship with the child in an intermediate place, in a healthcare perspective and to prevent any future impairment of the quality of the mother-child relationship by the psychiatric disorder. The Crisis Intervention Unit is not an emergency \"mother-child\" unit. Other French experiences have been reported, an example being mother-baby hospitalization in a crisis centre. The aim of our interventions is not the same, and our local context, together with the availability of a healthcare network on different floors, which is specific and close-by, allows this approach. Also, the contribution of Liaison Psychiatry in emergency situations should not be minimized. It is necessary to work in collaboration with the obstetricians. In fact, the chance to work with us was given by asking for a hospitalization in the Obstetric unit, during the prepartum period of pregnancies with a psychiatric risk. This way of proceeding allows somatic monitoring in hospital to be performed, whenever the risk run by the mother and/or the child requires it. This \"analogue\" procedure, however preventative it may be, does not always allow specific treatment of the psychiatric disorders to be given, despite liaison psychiatry interventions. Our interventions are not a specialized \"mother-child\" unit, or a substitute for Liaison Psychiatry, but they are specifically aimed at the context of the crisis. Obviously, it is precisely this dimension of the crisis which makes the other types of management temporarily unsuitable. This new working framework, with the simple possibility of admitting women and interacting with them in a crisis situation, with the aid of the competence of \"mother-child\" teams, most often seems to allow an alternative to hospitalization in the Psychiatry department, at the same time keeping up quality management of problems linked to the pregnancy or post-partum period. The specificity of the CIU, with its project of taking the special psychiatric vulnerability of pregnancy into account, makes sure that the psychopathological aspects of the crisis situation and the physiological aspects of adaptation reactions to the perinatal period are not neglected, but that are respected by this type of interaction/intervention."}, {"Title": "[Influence of depressive history on biological parameters in major depression].", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder is associated with several biological abnormalities. Among them, sleep disturbances and alterations of hypothalamic structures and cortisol system have been largely studied. Most studies have found a relationship between depression and alteration of sleep. Electroencephalic sleep profiles during depression demonstrate abnormalities of sleep continuity, reduction of slow waves sleep and REM pressure (27). The cortisol system, investigated by the Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST), is abnormal in about an half of the depressed subjects. We confirm a cortisol escape from suppression by dexamethasone (21). A complex dysregulation of the Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal axis (HPA) is thought to explain this escape (15, 33). The HPA has been first involved in the theory of stress. There are two ways to study this. First by looking at early adversities and genetic susceptibility to stress, and second by studying acute stressors and depressive reactions (8). The sensitization model postulated that the acute abnormalities of depression may leave biological scares. Those scares could make people more vulnerable to latter depressive triggers (34). We could then suppose that biological correlates of depression become more severe during the course of the illness. The present study further examines relationships between DST, polysomnography and some clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the depressive illness. We tried to examine if there were increasing biological disturbances during the course of the illness. We also examined the effect of the history of illness on the psychosocial stressors, and the effects of those stressors on the biological correlates of depression.\nThe DST and polysomnographic recordings were performed in a sample of 130 inpatients with primary major depressive disorder, unipolar form, as defined with the RDC (41). All of those patients have been consecutively admitted to the Sleep Laboratory of the Department of Psychiatry, Erasme Hospital, between 1981 and 1992. This population has been previously reported elsewhere (19, 20, 21). The depressive symptom severity was assessed with the 24-items HRSD (17). The Newcastle Endogenous Depression Diagnostic Index was used to assess the endogenous character of the depressive episode (5). The history of the illness and the impact of psychosocial stressors were assessed retrospectively using the interview associated with the RDC (41), the SADS (7). Psychosocial stressor has been assessed using the item 216 of the SADS. We must remind that it is not a precise measurement of stress.\nTable I shows clinical characteristics and biological variables in our 130 depressed patients. No correlation were found between number of depressive episodes and DST or EEG sleep records (table II). Age of onset was correlated with DST and all sleep EEG parameters (REM latency, REM density, awakening and slow wave sleep). But the age was a major confounding factor. When corrected the results for age, a significant correlation between age of onset and DST still remained, but no correlation between age of onset and EEG sleep results (table III). The psychosocial stressors were correlated only with awakening. A positive trend was found between an augmentation of psychosocial stressors and the number of episodes (p = 0.06).\nThis study does not support the view that the biological correlates of depression are worsening with the course of the illness. We found only correlation between age of onset and DST, but a possible confounding effect of age cannot formerly be excluded. The impact of psychosocial stressors on the biological correlates of depression was minimal. The only significant correlation found was between awakening and psychosocial stressors. We found no correlation between psychosocial stressors and the course of depression. Those results do not support the view of sensitization of the illness, but it should be remember that evaluation of psychosocial stressors by item 216 of the SADS was probably not a sufficient sensitive measure. We suggest thus that the impact of the history of depression on biological correlates of depression is not very strong. An alternative explanation of the lack of correlation found is that we used inaccurate measurement of the course of depression. For example, we had no evaluation of the quality of remission between different episodes of depression and of subsyndromic depression. Recent works show the importance of this (6, 9). The major limitations of this work were the retrospective character of the study and the low precision of the evaluation of psychosocial stressors used."}, {"Title": "[Temperament and affective disorders.

However, self-alienation may be regarded as the hallmark of mental illness in general and is based on the ambiguous structure of human personality itself. Thorough analysis of the concept of the person is therefore indispensable to understanding psychopathology. This paper focuses on the contrast of \"persona\" (\"mask\" or \"role\") on the one hand to \"person\" as an individual self on the other. Their dialectical relation derives from basic anthropological structures such as sociality, self-reference, self-transcendence, and fictionality. As can be shown, the historical and cultural ontogeny of the personality includes experiences of self-alienation which may become relevant for psychiatry as depersonalization syndromes. The example of depression is used to illustrate vital and emotional depersonalization, whereas schizophrenia may be described as \"intentional depersonalization.\" Following this line of reasoning, the classic schizophrenic experiences of alien control or thought insertion are interpreted as a disturbance in the fundamental personality structures."}, {"Title": "[A family day clinic in child psychiatry.

It is exemplary for so many of his contemporaries of Jewish origin, who were forced to emigrate under the National Socialist dictatorship. Hauptmann's career was most of all marked by the short, but to him formative time with Max Nonne. Throughout his life his research focused on neurological topics. In 1926, Hauptmann got the chair of psychiatry at Halle University in order to continue the important neurological tradition of Eduard Hitzig, Carl Wernicke and Gabriel Anton. Until 1935, he worked as the director of the psychiatric clinic in Halle, but in the course of the Reichsb\u00fcrgergesetz he had to give up his chair and his work as a doctor. The way into emigration, which was accelerated by the temporary imprisonment in the concentration camp Dachau, is described considering personal documents. After his emigration into the United States, Hauptmann was not too successful in starting new as a scientist. His most important contribution is still the article on the efficacy of Phenobarbital as an antiepileptic, which had been written already in 1912.

Already at the beginning of his career as professor in Zurich, he had a very intimate knowledge of psychiatric patients from his 12 years as director of the Mental Hospital Rheinau (near Zurich) where he lived as a bachelor with his patients in the same building. In his inaugural lecture, Bleuler already discussed very practical problems of psychiatric service. e.g. work, employment, marriage, situation in patient's family, housing, occupational therapy etc. Working in the group of other patients should help to re-establish the relationship to the common reality and the society. Psychotherapy for schizophrenics was mentioned in 1911 as the only serious therapy, but was not further elaborated. In 1939, Bleuler was much more sceptical concerning the realistic possibilities of an efficient psychotherapy of schizophrenia. Psychoanalysis would only allow a psychological understanding of some symptoms in schizophrenia but would be unable to contribute to a theory of the underlying pathogenesis. In his view, schizophrenia has its own inherent development. This resignation concerning constructive and efficient therapy dominates his confession even in his last lecture when retiring 1927. Considering the paucity of therapeutic possibilities, Bleuler underlined the importance of prophylactic eugenic strategies."}, {"Title": "Public attitude to compulsory admission of mentally ill people.", "Abstract": "Assessing the public attitude to compulsory admission of mentally ill in Switzerland and analyzing the influence of demographic, psychological, and sociological factors.\nWe conducted a representative telephone survey with 1737 interviewees.

It is argued in this paper that Szasz's theory is incomplete for two reasons: first, in assuming that reasons are radically different from causes, it cannot account for the possibility that \"sane\" behaviour might be just as much caused as \"insane\"; and second, it tacitly assumes that the origin of behaviour always lies with the agent--a view that arguably is an accident of grammar.

Not to be left behind, the sexual predator and the obsessional harasser have found cyberspace to be a vehicle capable of meeting their needs: obtaining information, monitoring and contacting victims, developing fantasy, overcoming inhibitions, avoiding apprehension, and communicating with other offenders. Although clearly disparate offender categories, these two groups are included in this article because of the likelihood of their using the Internet in pursuit of their goals. Forensic psychiatrists should become familiar with computers and the Internet so that they can conduct relevant psychiatric evaluations of such individuals and can advise attorneys, victims, and law enforcement personnel competently, when retained in that capacity. This article discusses the Internet and its use by the sexual predator and the obsessional harasser, highlighting information of interest to the forensic psychiatrist, including the poorly understood field of digital evidence.

These articles, frequently anecdotal and with little empirical support, conceptualized supervision as a developmental process, a syndrome, or a process of identification. They focused substantially on the nature of the relationship between the trainee and supervisor. More recent writers have included trainees' perspectives. They have identified a number of problems with supervision, including role conflicts, uncertainty about boundaries, lack of supervisory training and lack of effective feedback, and have introduced the concepts of adult learning as highly relevant. These concerns, however, have led to little change to date.\nThe implementation by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) of new training by-laws provides an opportunity to define the meaning of supervision in the current clinical context, to undertake research to clarify the key elements in the process, and to evaluate different techniques of supervision."}, {"Title": "The roles and relationships of psychiatrists and other service providers in mental health services.", "Abstract": "A number of the problems facing psychiatry are identified as having common origins in unresolved issues about teamwork.

Teamwork and collaboration are central to good working relationships and service delivery. Effective teamwork and collaboration is supported by key elements including agreed goals, an agreed approach, effective communication styles, established ground rules, clear team roles, and competent leadership. The obstacles to effective teamwork and collaboration are discussed in terms of the following: ambiguity and conflict over roles; conflict and confusion over leadership; differing understandings of clinical responsibility and accountability; interprofessional misperceptions; and differing rewards between the professions.\nDeveloping an understanding of these issues opens the way to a series of recommendations in relation to education, professional organizations, and workplaces and government, which can be considered by a number of sectors and groups."}, {"Title": "Notes towards a professional ethics for psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The uniqueness of psychiatry calls for a unique ethics.

In some branches of medicine it is already used clinically, for instance, to diagnose tumours and in psychiatry its applications are gradually extending beyond research. Neurochemical changes have been found in a variety of brain regions in dementia, schizophrenia and affective disorders and promising discoveries have also been made in anxiety disorders.\nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy is a non-invasive investigative technique that has provided useful insights into the biochemical basis of many neuropsychiatric disorders. It allows direct measurement, in vivo, of medication levels within the brain and has made it possible to track the neurochemical changes that occur as a consequence of disease and ageing or in response to treatment.

This converging interdisciplinary data was used as a theoretical base for modelling the effects of early relational trauma on the developing central and autonomic nervous system activities that drive attachment functions.\nCurrent trends that integrate neuropsychiatry, infant psychiatry, and clinical psychiatry are generating more powerful models of the early genesis of a predisposition to psychiatric disorders, including PTSD. Data are presented which suggest that traumatic attachments, expressed in episodes of hyperarousal and dissociation, are imprinted into the developing limbic and autonomic nervous systems of the early maturing right brain. These enduring structural changes lead to the inefficient stress coping mechanisms that lie at the core of infant, child, and adult posttraumatic stress disorders.\nDisorganised-disoriented insecure attachment, a pattern common in infants abused in the first 2 years of life, is psychologically manifest as an inability to generate a coherent strategy for coping with relational stress. Early abuse negatively impacts the developmental trajectory of the right brain, dominant for attachment, affect regulation, and stress modulation, thereby setting a template for the coping deficits of both mind and body that characterise PTSD symptomatology. These data suggest that early intervention programs can significantly alter the intergenerational transmission of posttraumatic stress disorders."}, {"Title": "[Current status of studies of schizophrenia after DSM-III].", "Abstract": "The reinforcement of biological studies of schizophrenia by the DSM-III had been promoted by the general medicalization of psychiatry itself, following the successful introduction of antipsychotic drugs as well as the advance in brain research. The traditional view of schizophrenia has included since the time of Kraepelin till present the presumed biological basic diseases and specific psychological reaction. The DSM notion of schizophrenia presumes exclusively biological aspects in that it is based on a very simple unitary model, although the lack of sufficient validity has not been compensated by the advance in the biological studies that produced a number of related findings but not the marker of schizophrenia. The exclusion of the concept of psychosis makes it difficult to discuss the semantic isolation in which the patients of this disorder are often entrapped. The symptoms are regarded as indices of presumed biological diseases rather than a product of semantic interaction. The simple model of schizophrenia is easy to use in biological studies but too weak to give clinical significance to the various findings detected. It will be insightful to look into other modes of diagnosis such as Kleist-Leonhardt or French school as well as subtle basic disturbance in German school that are not mentioned in the current DSM system."}, {"Title": "Dimensional structure of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS).", "Abstract": "The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is a widely used instrument to assess obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. The present study provides evidence that the Y-BOCS is best represented by a three-dimensional model comprising severity of obsessions (factor 1), severity of compulsions (factor 2) and resistance to symptoms (factor 3). On the basis of exploratory factor analysis, this structure was found for both baseline (n = 109) and discharge ratings (n = 68) following a multimodal cognitive-behavioral intervention. The factor solution remained essentially unchanged when two optional items (items 1b and 6b) were dropped from analysis. The three-factor structure was replicated with confirmatory factor analysis and showed better fit than previously proposed single- and two-factor models. For future research, we propose a new Y-BOCS scoring algorithm that takes this factor structure into account.

In the present study, factors that influenced attrition at a child psychiatry outpatient clinic in Basel were assessed during two separate periods. Between the two assessments, the results of the first period were presented to the staff and were discussed. At first assessment, attrition was increased in patients who were referred as emergencies or by somatic hospitals. In contrast, attrition was low in patients who were referred involuntarily. At second assessment, there was a significant decrease in dropping-out for the total sample and for emergencies. This result may be explained by a more careful clarification of the setting before first consultation and, as a consequence, by higher congruence between patients' expectations and the clinic's offers. Further studies on the subject of attrition in child and adolescent psychiatry should focus on clearly defined clinical situations and samples and include measures of patients' expectations as well as of the therapeutic relationship."}, {"Title": "[Subjective quality of life of children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders: development and validation of a new assessment scale].", "Abstract": "Within paediatric disciplines and in particular in child and adolescent psychiatry very little work is available regarding the quality of life (QoL) of patients. After using literature search and interviews for identifying the relevant QoL domains, a set of self report questionnaires (for the parents: proxy rating) was developed (C-version: children 10 to 14 years, A-version: adolescents 14 to 18 years, P-version: parental proxy rating about child/adolescent). It was aimed at an almost identical wording within each questionnaire version in regard to the different QoL domains. The questionnaires should not primarily address symptomatology (like e.g. the Child Behaviour Checklist by Achenbach and Edelbrock 1983). After a pilot phase ensuring adequacy and appropriateness of the forms, the questionnaires were field tested in a consecutive series of nearly 700 patients which were referred to the Cologne university department of child and adolescent psychiatry for diagnosis and treatment between 1996 and 2000. The intended structure of the questionnaire system with symptom and functioning scales concerning the domains: \"physical performance, fatigue, anxiety, depression, peer group, school, family, beliefs, general QoL\" and some further single questions was confirmed by psychometric testing (validity and reliability). Interscale correlations were in general moderate, exhibiting the expected pattern. Analyses of variances using the method of \"known groups comparisons\" showed e.g. age, sex, and diagnosis related effects hinting towards clinically meaningful differences. The questionnaire forms were well accepted and understood by patients and parents and the wording of the addressed topics was reported to be adequate. Further work will include the psychopathological findings and will focus on specific subgroups of patients (e.g. different diagnoses) as well as on the longitudinal observation of special patient groups, e.g. patients with eating disorders.

Axis one results in a DSM-IV Axis II categorical diagnosis, whereas axis two refers to a symptomatological, dimensional or functional approach, in which the psychological dysfunctions of the nosological syndrome are depicted. Moreover, in a clinical context a basic aim of the diagnostic evaluation is to obtain therapeutically valid information that leads to a constructive conceptual framework, to a case formulation in which therapeutic interventions are understood, selected and implemented. This framework should be based on a biopsychosocial theoretical model and its application in the clinical context involves feedback to the patient, in which the descriptive evaluation is integrated with etiological; and pathogenic elements using an idiographic approach. This therapeutically orientated diagnostic strategy is illustrated by the use of the ADP-IV (Assessment of DSM-IV personality disorders) questionnaire within a cognitive behavioral orientation."}, {"Title": "Reflections on the past and present state of Russian psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This paper is an analysis of three periods of Russian psychiatry: before 1917, during the Soviet period, and after the fall of the Soviet Empire. The section on Russian psychiatry before 1917 considers the biomedical model in psychiatry which was transferred from somatic medicine without recognising the difference in the character of signs and symptoms. Mechanisms of mental disorders were analysed predominately from the position of the \"physiology of superior nervous activity\". At the same time, the role of the social and psychological factors in psychiatric problems was not totally ignored. The psychoanalytical approach was accepted and adopted. The second section considers ideological concepts which influenced the development of Soviet psychiatry. Psychological approaches to diagnosis, treatment and explanation of the mechanisms of development of the disorders were prohibited and excluded from the practice of psychiatrists. The clinical orientation of Soviet psychiatry was directed towards the disclosure of the symptoms, syndromes and nosologies according to oversimplified interpretation of psychiatric terminology. As a result psychiatrists developed a specific mentality and skills in detecting symptoms of psychopathology in every consulted person. Psychiatric statistics were published in a wholly misleading manner. The last section reviews current situation in contemporary Russian psychiatry. Its development continues to be influenced by \"negative\" aspects inherited from the Soviet era. It is expressed, particularly, in the continued hyper diagnosis of schizophrenia and extremal postponement of the official use of the adapted version of ICD-10 containing several deformations as compared to the original one. However, psychological approaches are revived and many Russian psychiatrists are taking an active interest in recent developments in the field of psychodynamic and transcultural approaches, and to deploy them in their clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Intravenous valproate: a new perspective in the treatment of manic symptoms.", "Abstract": "Over the last few years, the use of valproate in psychiatry has increased considerably.

The intravenous formulation of valproate, while retaining the rapidity of action of oral loading, also avoids some of the adverse effects of the oral preparation. Moreover, reports are pouring in that intravenous valproate loading may be more efficacious than oral valproate loading in the treatment of acute mania.

Cases must therefore be identified before practical help can be offered.\nAfter two and a half hours of formal training, local community health workers in rural Kerala were asked to identify possible cases of dementia from the community they served. Diagnoses were then verified by a senior local psychiatrist with clinical and research interests in old age psychiatry.\nThe community health workers identified 51 out of 1979 over 60 year old residents (a prevalence of 2.6%) as suspected cases of dementia. Following the psychiatrist's assessment, 33 met DSM-IV criteria for dementia. The majority of confirmed cases were of the Alzheimer's Disease sub-type. Most \"non-cases\" were found to be suffering from other major psychiatric disorders, with substantial unmet need.

However, a second stigma has contributed to the late development of interest in the psychological dimensions of cancer: negative attitudes attached to mental illness and psychological problems, even in the context of medical illness. It is important to understand these historical underpinnings because they continue to color contemporary attitudes and beliefs about cancer and its psychiatric comorbidity and psychosocial problems. Over the last quarter of the past century, psycho-oncology became a subspecialty of oncology with its own body of knowledge contributing to cancer care. In the new millennium, a significant base of literature, training programs, and a broad research agenda have evolved with applications at all points on the cancer continuum: behavioral research in changing lifestyle and habits to reduce cancer risk; study of behaviors and attitudes to ensure early detection; study of psychological issues related to genetic risk and testing; symptom control (anxiety, depression, delirium, pain, and fatigue) during active treatment; management of psychological sequelae in cancer survivors; and management of the psychological aspects of palliative and end-of-life care. Links between psychological and physiological domains of relevance to cancer risk and survival are being actively explored through psychoneuroimmunology.

This paper provides a brief overview of BDD in adolescents, presents and evaluates the most recent literature on approaches to diagnosis and treatment, and highlights some of the characteristics that distinguish BDD from other disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, depression, and eating disorders."}, {"Title": "The use of electroencephalography in psychiatry of the medically ill.", "Abstract": "The psychiatrist considering recommending an EEG should look for acute changes in the history or examination suggestive of an organic cause. If he or she judges that the EEG will help to clarify or confirm the diagnostic impression already formulated, it is worth considering whether adding provocative maneuvers could increase the yield. The authors cannot overemphasize the importance of using the EEG in correlation to further inform old-fashioned clinical detective work already in process, particularly when the EEG could rule out a potential organic contributor to a psychiatric phenotype.

Close relatives, if not killed in the fire, often also experience clinically significant bystander stress. Closeness of relationships may be lost, and self-image may suffer. Property damage and loss of crucial resources may be associated with fires. Although many burns result from accidents, most result from preventable causes associated with psychiatric disorders, which include mood disorders, psychoses, cognitive disorders, and substance-use disorders. Burns then result from: Deliberate self-harm Impaired judgment and poor coordination associated with substance intoxication Risk-taking behavior Poor supervision of children and impaired elderly persons Careless handling of flammable materials. Many clinical syndromes, such as delirium, ASD, acute psychosis, suicidality, and pain need to be addressed by the consulting psychiatrist to facilitate surgical treatment of the burn injury. Other psychiatric disorders, such as PTSD, major depression, and adjustment disorder, need to be treated to expedite long-term adjustment. Hospital length of stay and RTW/RTS are major outcome variables. The psychiatry consultant can positively affect both variables substantially using both pharmacologic and psychosocial measures. The important role of psychiatric issues both before and after burn injury support the need for more consistent and comprehensive medical insurance coverage for psychiatric consultation to burn units and clinics. Burn Support Groups are an invaluable asset."}, {"Title": "Is auditory evoked potential augmenting/reducing affected by acute tryptophan depletion?", "Abstract": "Several lines of evidence suggest that the auditory evoked potential (AEP) augmenting/reducing slope may serve as a biological marker of central serotonergic activity. According to Hegerl and Juckel (Biol. Psychiatry, 33, 1993, 173), reduced serotonergic activity is hypothesized to increase the slope of the AEP amplitude stimulus intensity function (ASF-slope). Hints for this hypothesis were investigated by employing the acute tryptophan depletion paradigm in 18 healthy females. A within-subject, placebo controlled double-blind cross over design was used for that purpose. Subjects ingested both a 50 g amino-acid drink with (placebo condition) and without tryptophan (depletion condition). With respect to the N1/P2-slope, test-retest reliability of a 1 week interval ranged between r=0.56 and 0.58 for the pre-ingestion baseline recording sessions. Affect was not altered by tryptophan depletion and not related to the ASF-slope. The comparison between placebo and depletion conditions did not reveal significant alterations of the ASF-slope, neither after 5 nor 6 h post-ingestion. Thus, the results do not support the assumption of the ASF-slope reflecting central serotonergic function."}, {"Title": "Functional brain mapping of psychopathology.", "Abstract": "In this paper, we consider the impact that the novel functional neuroimaging techniques may have upon psychiatric illness. Functional neuroimaging has rapidly developed as a powerful tool in cognitive neuroscience and, in recent years, has seen widespread application in psychiatry. Although such studies have produced evidence for abnormal patterns of brain response in association with some pathological conditions, the core pathophysiologies remain unresolved. Although imaging techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity for investigation of physiological function of the living human brain, there are fundamental questions and assumptions which remain to be addressed. In this review we examine these conceptual issues under three broad sections: (1) characterising the clinical population of interest, (2) defining appropriate levels of description of normal brain function, and (3) relating these models to pathophysiological conditions. Parallel advances in each of these questions will be required before imaging techniques can impact on clinical decisions in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Cortical connectivity in high frequency beta-rhythm in schizophrenics with positive and negative symptoms.", "Abstract": "During the last decade the role of high frequency EEG activity in the 'binding phenomenon' was discovered.

Exploratory factor analysis was conducted after 440 medical students rated one of 12 diverse conditions. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed after 163 medical students rated two psychiatric conditions. Validity was evaluated by the scale's ability to meaningfully stratify the 12 conditions and identify changes in attitudes toward psychiatric conditions after a psychiatry clerkship.\nExploratory factor analysis supported an 11-item unidimensional solution (all factor loadings >.40, coefficient alpha =.87). The final scale, the Medical Condition Regard Scale (MCRS), taps the degree to which medical students find patients with a given medical condition to be enjoyable, treatable, and worthy of medical resources. The unidimensional model also was supported by the confirmatory factor analyses for the two psychiatric conditions (both comparative fit indices =.98). The scale stratified the 12 conditions as expected: straightforward medical conditions rated highest, somatoform conditions rated lowest. Students showed greater regard for patients with major depression after the psychiatry clerkship, and students who rotated through an addiction treatment program showed a greater increase in regard for patients with alcoholism than did students not exposed to addiction treatment.\nMCRS scores are reliable, and the scale appears to be a valid instrument for assessing regard for any medical condition."}, {"Title": "Comparative bioethics in bipolar and epilepsy research.", "Abstract": "AEDs are increasingly evaluated for efficacy in bipolar disorders utilizing double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) as required by the FDA. However, the risk to patients is under-estimated in trial design. Bipolar depression has a significant risk for suicide; bipolar episodes can lead to kindling with increased long-term morbidity; rapid regression may occur during the placebo phase or during dose ranging trials with resultant active suicide status. The associated risks mandate that the ethics of FDA-required protocols are addressed.\nComparative analysis and literature review of bipolar and epilepsy research designs.\nIn psychiatry, all INDs require RCTs for approval. In epilepsy, AEDs are initially approved as add-on agents only. Once AEDs have demonstrated add-on efficacy, cross-over studies comparing active AEDs, sub-optimal dosing paradigms, new-onset, and pre-surgical inpatient placebo trials are utilized to prove efficacy of the new AED in monotherapy. Ethical considerations to avoid seizures and to minimize risks to subjects have led to newer clinical trial designs.\nThe FDA initially requires add-on studies with new AEDs due to the risk of seizures during the placebo phase. The author argues that bipolar research warrants similar add-on studies to prove efficacy because the risk of suicide and increased long-term morbidity in the bipolar population is as significant as the risk of seizures in the epilepsy population. Although the number of patients needed to prove statistical efficacy would increase, the safety of such research would also markedly increase. The author further concludes that with the risk of suicide during bipolar research, ethical considerations require increased frequency of patient contact with a significant other co-signing the informed consent for research and serving as a contact for the coordinator."}, {"Title": "Color and number preferences of patients with psychiatric disorders in eastern Turkey.", "Abstract": "Color and number preferences have not been studied in healthy sublets and psychiatric patients in Turkey.

Problem-based learning (PBL) was chosen as the central educational method throughout the 5 years. A thematic interdisciplinary style provided a framework around which to select and integrate content. The theme for family, reproductive and child health for the 14-week Families and Children Module (FCM) in year 4 integrated content from obstetrics-gynaecology, paediatrics (including child psychiatry), genetics and public health. This paper focuses on the FCM which has put to test some of the principles of integration.\nThe educational process and outcome of the FCM was evaluated with information from (1) Open Forum feedback sessions (2) student questionnaires and (3) students' performance in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE).\nSignificant problems were encountered during the first year of the FCM (1997--98). An Open Forum for all students and staff was convened after each module in order to address the level of concern. Students' responses to questionnaires reflected the overall impression obtained from the Open Forum. Difficulties appeared to be more than the anxieties and challenges inherent in organisational change and were not simple practical timetabling problems. Tutors perceived a loss of coherence and student contact; students reported difficulties maintaining sufficient continuity of focus in clinical and academic learning experiences. The intended level of integration of paediatrics and obstetrics-gynaecology was unmanageable. Consequently, the FCM (1998-99) was divided into separate attachments for clinical learning and experience in paediatrics and obstetrics-gynaecology, each of 7 weeks' duration. Further open feedback sessions revealed that the modifications implemented in 1998-99 were associated with positive experiences for students and tutors. Comparison of responses to the evaluation questionnaires showed that students' overall rating of the module was higher (P=0.002) for 1998-99 (mean 3.4, SD 0.9) than for 1997-98 (mean 3.0, SD 1.1).\nWe emphasise that horizontal integration can result in an experience of disintegration for students and tutors.

Forty patients with recurrent unexplained syncope referred for head-up tilt testing were compared with age- and sex-matched patients free of known chronic PDs referred for arrhythmia. All patients underwent a semistandardized psychiatry questionnaire (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) to assess their profile. Additional stress coping was performed to study adaptational processes to stressful situations. After tilt testing and psychiatric evaluation, a drug-free follow-up was performed in patients with syncope. Of the 80 patients who referred to the psychiatric interview, 40 had evidence of at least 1 psychiatric disorder. They were 26 patients (65%) in the syncope group and 14 patients (35%) in the control group (p = 0.01). Detailed analysis revealed a more frequent subprofile of anxiety and panic disorders in patients with syncope than in controls (30% vs 12% and 20% vs 10%, respectively), whereas the subprofile of depression was similar in both groups. Moreover, those with syncope were more likely to have a high anxiety index (25 +/- 5 vs 22 +/- 4, p = 0.004), and were more prone to avoidance-oriented coping strategies when experiencing undesirable life events than controls. Considering syncope patients, no difference could be found between the 25 with a positive tilt test and the 15 with a negative tilt test with respect to the number of syncopal episodes and psychiatric profile. After a 3-year drug-free follow-up, 15 patients (37.5%) had at least 1 recurrent syncope. The recurrence rate was similar in patients with positive and negative head-up tilt test results (9 of 25 vs 6 of 15, respectively). In contrast, the syncopal recurrence rate was higher in patients who fulfilled criteria for affective disorders (13 of 26 vs 2 of 14, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 2.55, relative risk 1.7, p = 0.04). Thus, patients with recurrent unexplained syncope are more anxious and are more prone to panic disorders and avoidance-oriented coping strategies than control patients with arrhythmia. The presence of a psychiatric disorder is associated with an increased risk of recurrence. The outcome of such patients may be improved with recognition and treatment of PDs."}, {"Title": "Dopamine may be 'hyper' with respect to noradrenaline metabolism, but 'hypo' with respect to serotonin metabolism in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "Noradrenaline: Hechtman (J Psychiat Neurosci 1994;19:193) argued for a role for frontal dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) in ADHD, where Oades (Prog Neurobiol 1987;29:365) has described lateralised functional impairments. Mechanisms (e.g. via alpha-2 sites) for stimulating low NA activity in ADHD children (J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry 1997;36:1688) in order to promote interactions with mesocortical DA have been discussed (J Psychopharmacology 1997;11:151; Psychiatr Res 1994;52:305). We described with indicators of overall transmitter metabolism (monoamines, metabolites in 24 h urine samples (Behav Brain Res 1997;88:95)) significantly lower utilisation ratios (MHPG/NA) in ADHD children with respect to healthy controls. Interestingly, a comparison of between catecholamine levels (DA/NA) showed a correlation with the conditioned blocking measure of selective attention recorded at the time of collection. This measure was negatively associated with blocking in controls. These results are consistent with reports of lower DOPEG and increased DOPAC in ADHD urine (J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol 1996;6:63) and indicate that the relatively hyperactive DA versus NA systems may have functional consequences. Serotonin: the relevance for ADHD of an association of impulsivity with low serotonin (5-HT) metabolism (Behav Brain Sci 1986;9:319) has long been played down. Yet, some symptoms have been related to CSF measures of the metabolite 5-HIAA, and in particular the HVA/5-HIAA ratio has been reported to correlate with ratings of activity (Psychiatr Res 1994;52:305). We find that while urinary measures of 5-HIAA are somewhat higher, the ratio HVA/5-HIAA is markedly lower in ADHD children versus controls. In these ADHD children 5-HIAA levels were negatively related to d-prime measures in a continuous performance task (CPTax), and the HVA/5-HIAA was negatively associated with conditioned blocking. These results suggest a relatively low DA versus 5-HT activity may have functional consequences, albeit in a subgroup of ADHD.

Adaptationist and nonadaptationist conceptualizations.", "Abstract": "Darwin's theory of evolution, and in particular one of its mechanisms, natural selection, is being used as the explanatory cornerstone of many unsolved problems in human biology and human affairs. Psychiatry is an example of that. Darwinian psychiatry's main proponents endorse the adaptationist program to carry out their project to implement an evolutionary psychiatry. The adaptationist program is an attempt to view all evolutionary novelties as adaptations, i.e., classically, features that favour survival and/or reproduction. This position is definitely teleological, and anthropomorphism plays a central role in its construction. This paper takes issue with the adaptationist approach. We argue that organism-environment interactions are bidirectional processes. Hence, as a result of the fact that \"a surprisingly large amount of the environment, which affects natural selection on an animal is the more or less direct result of the animals own behavior\" [Waddington, C.H., 1976. Evolution of the subhuman world. In: Jantsch, E., Waddington, C.H. (Eds.), Evolution of Consciousness. London, UK, pp. 11-23], a more appropriate term to describe these interactions appears to be construction rather than adaptation alone [Lewontin, R., 2000. The triple helix: gene organism and environment. Harvard Univ. Press]. We present factual anatomical, physiological and clinical data critical of the platonic Kraepelinean classification of mental diseases, and claim that this classification is contrary to modern ideas on the evolution of nervous systems. We argue against the view of mainstream evolutionary psychiatrists that mental diseases are adaptations. We do so on two accounts. One is methodological; authors in this position do not ask whether every disease has evolutionary causes, but assume this in order to explain all diseases in such terms. The other mistake is biological; it is their belief that adaptation is the driving force of evolution while in fact it is just an outcome of evolution. The current status of the controversy between cognitive versus emotional experiences as essentially independent is reviewed, and evidence is presented, that they cannot be considered platonic, categorically independent functions of CNSs. These data, taken together, plus arguments derived from the high degree of plasticity of nervous systems, lead us to suggest a different approach to classification of mental diseases."}, {"Title": "[Disease and responsibility for one's own actions--history of forensic expertise].", "Abstract": "In the 19th century, a general rule of exemption from jural imputability for the mentally deranged was codified in Norwegian criminal law. The legislative measure was not phrased in medical terminology; nevertheless, the ground was cleared for increasing usage of medical expertise in criminal proceedings. The medical community in Norway held diverse opinions as to the role of forensic medicine/psychiatry. This article explores the debate within the profession from the vantage point a homicide case from 1874 in which expert opinions were sought from a country doctor, the director of a state asylum, and from the professors of the national university's faculty of medicine. The various opinions testify to the elasticity of the jural notion of imputability and how inaccurate it would be to label positions in this highly contested field as either progressive or reactionary: 19th century notions of mental illness were as complex as they were context-sensitive."}, {"Title": "[Models for understanding personality pathology].", "Abstract": "The prevalence of personality disorders is high and patients with personality disorders are known to be difficult to treat. The assessment of different types of personality disorders has been facilitated by the development of explicit diagnostic criteria. However, the diagnostic manuals have tended to be atheoretical, defining and classifying personality disorders mainly on a descriptive level of behaviour and symptoms. There is no consensus on a theoretical understanding of personality pathology. The concept of personality disorder is currently under debate and investigation, theoretically as well as empirically.\nThis paper presents some of the major theories of personality disorders that are currently discussed in the literature.\nThe models represent different schools of thought, lean on different methodological assumptions, and focus on different aspects of personality. The theories are to varying degrees focused on aetiology, classification and treatment. A major trend is to supplement theories developed within the context of clinical psychiatry with models from normal psychology.\nPersonality disorder is a complex phenomenon. Different theories are probably useful for different aspects of personality pathology and for different groups of personality disorders. More empirical research is needed in order to clarify the validity of the different models."}, {"Title": "[The application of the patients' rights law in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The application of the Israeli law of patients rights in psychiatry raises several dilemmas.

Eight healthy volunteers were scanned during rest and when presented startle-eliciting stimuli. We performed a theory-driven directed search for activity in the nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis, situated in the pons. Because habituation of cerebellar activity during acoustic startle repetition has been reported [Timmann, D., Musso, C., Kolb, F.P., Rijntjes, M., Juptner, M., Muller, S.P., Diener, H.C. & Weiller, C. (1998) J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry 65, 771-773], we also predicted habituation in the cerebellum and in the pons as a function of startle repetition. Measurements of eye electromyography validated the presence of a startle response and its habituation. Analysis of regional cerebral blood flow revealed higher neural activity during startle stimulation than at rest in a medial pons area consistent with the location of the pontine reticular nucleus. As a consequence of startle repetition, regional cerebral blood flow increased in the medial cerebellum, and habituated in the ventral cerebellum and in a ventral pons area separate from the pontine reticular nucleus. In the ventral pons, but not in the pontine reticular nucleus, regional cerebral blood flow and the startle reflex were positively correlated. In the cerebellum both positive and negative correlations with the startle reflex were observed. Thus we conclude that the neurofunctional correlates of the startle circuit and its habituation in humans are similar to that previously described in animals."}, {"Title": "Audit of the Forensic Psychiatry Liaison Service to Glasgow Sheriff Court 1994 to 1998.", "Abstract": "This study seeks to describe the demographic, offence, and diagnostic details of subjects referred by the Procurator Fiscal at Glasgow Sheriff Court to the Forensic Psychiatry Liaison between 1994 and 1997.

In the last 10 years, the concept of posttraumatic stress disorder as originated in the USA became dominant.\nPsychiatry in Germany has a long and inconsistent tradition of theories and concepts on trauma. The historical view may enrich the current debate in which the concept of posttraumatic stress disorder has been increasingly criticized."}, {"Title": "Attributions of physical symptoms in patients of an old age psychiatry service.", "Abstract": "Somatization is a phenomenon found across all medical specialities and in all types of care. There has been little in the way of systematic investigation of the phenomenon in older people.\nThe objective was to establish whether treatment for psychiatric illness would be accompanied by a fall in somatic attributions.\nPatients' attributions of physical symptoms were studied in a consecutive group of older people with functional disorders (mostly depression) referred to an old age psychiatry service. Depression, anxiety, physical illness and attributional style were measured soon after referral and seven months later.\n41 subjects were interviewed in the first leg. Anxiety was the chief association of abnormal attributional style. At follow up (n = 29) mean depression and anxiety scale scores and somatic attributions of symptoms had fallen significantly.\nAbnormal focus on physical symptoms in depressed elderly patients may resolve with treatment."}, {"Title": "The second Leicester survey of memory clinics in the British Isles.", "Abstract": "The number of memory clinics in the British Isles has increased since our first survey in 1993.\nThe aim of this survey was to determine the memory clinics' characteristics and functions, and to compare these with the findings of our previous survey.\nAn expanded version of the 1993 questionnaire was sent to 102 possible memory clinics, identified by various means. There were 72 replies, 58 of which were from currently active clinics.\nThere has been a substantial growth in the number of clinics since our previous survey in 1993, apparently stimulated by the licensing of cholinesterase inhibitor drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the development of services for early-onset dementia. Most of the new memory clinics have been set up within NHS old age psychiatry services, and they tend to be smaller and have less of an academic focus than the older clinics. However, they are similar in many aspects of their functioning, and have a similar range of practice with regard to patient assessment.\nAs memory clinics move out from academic centres into mainstream clinical services, there is potential for greater co-ordination of their activities, and the development of an agreed core data set for assessment that would be valuable in the national monitoring of new anti-dementia treatments in clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder: fact or artifact?", "Abstract": "To clarify whether the symptoms of inattention and distractibility commonly seen in children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) represent true comorbidity with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or a manifestation of obsessional anxiety.\nPhenotypic features and functional correlates of ADHD-like symptoms were examined in youths with and without OCD from a large sample of pediatric psychiatry patients consecutively referred since 1997.\nThe number, frequency, and types of core ADHD symptoms as well as ADHD-associated functional indices were identical in all youths with DSM-IV-diagnosed ADHD irrespective of the presence or absence of comorbid OCD.\nThese findings suggest that when ADHD-like symptoms are seen in youths with OCD, they reflect a true comorbid state of OCD plus ADHD and that the ADHD syndrome may be independent of OCD in comorbid youths."}, {"Title": "A child psychiatry chairman's view.", "Abstract": "Knowledge and services for children do not fare well when they are subordinate to either general or adult organizations. The history of the American Academy of Pediatrics and its publication, Pediatrics, and of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent psychiatry and the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry provides eloquent evidence of how independence and autonomy foster organization and productivity for forging ahead in the service of a richer collaboration with adult psychiatry departments. Independence in acquiring and disseminating clinical and scientific knowledge based on child and adolescent perspectives enriches in breadth and depth our capacity to improve priorities for children and youth as part of the continuum of the life cycle in human development. It is long overdue that child psychiatry should follow the inspiration and support of the Academy in establishing independent, autonomous clinical and academic departments of child psychiatry. I believe the department of child psychiatry can be replicated nationally and internationally, but not without conviction, medical center commitment, and major independent fund-raising."}, {"Title": "The administration of residency training programs.", "Abstract": "The position of training director is perhaps the most difficult job in a department of psychiatry. The training director must implement the values, culture, and philosophy of the department; nurture residents, faculty, and support staff; maintain collaborative ties with the hospital and medical school-allied specialties and administration; and monitor the integrity and quality of clinical and academic training. All this must be accomplished in a role that has considerable authority but no real power. The director needs to understand the context in which training occurs and take into account the limited resources of the health care delivery system and the constraints imposed by the current era of managed care. This article provides an overview of the requirements for successfully achieving these complex goals and objectives."}, {"Title": "Political lobbying for child and adolescent psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Lobbying for child and adolescent psychiatry works best when association members team with staff to communicate with members of Congress. Communication comes in many forms, some more effective than others, but without it, no opportunities for policy changes are generated. Legislators want to know what their constituents are interested in, and child and adolescent psychiatrists serve themselves and their profession by knowing the legislative agenda, using the tools available for reaching out to legislators, and using every opportunity available to move the agenda."}, {"Title": "Child and adolescent psychiatry. A state administrator's view.", "Abstract": "In the course of the nation's evolution toward managed-care service delivery and financing models, state administration of Medicaid and other public-sector health care services has become increasingly complex. This article reviews and comments on key policy issues that state administrators face in the organization and financing of Medicaid-managed behavioral health care services. The author offers recommendations for states that are considering additional reforms."}, {"Title": "Child and adolescent psychiatry. Exploring the option to be a manager in an academic medical center.", "Abstract": "Traditionally, few child psychiatrists have opted for careers as senior managers in academic medical centers, preferring to emphasize their clinical role and hoping their clinical work will be valued and reimbursed despite economic pressures. Yet the career of a hospital-wide manager in an academic medical center provides opportunities to promote an individual's career, the mission of the whole organization, and child psychiatry itself. Drawing on some of the issues discussed in the general literature on the clinician-executive, this article outlines the basic qualities and skills required to be a successful child psychiatrist executive and delineates the essential steps and potential pitfalls in building such a career. This delineation looks at the developmental stage of both the psychiatrist and the organization involved. The authors emphasize the importance of child psychiatrists assuming active roles within academic medical centers to protect and enhance the field of child psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Leadership in child psychiatry. A perspective from a department chair.", "Abstract": "A departmental chairman's expectations for the leader of a division of child and adolescent psychiatry vary widely. The author shares his personal experiences in this role as he describes clinical practice goals, clinical service delivery, research productivity, teaching excellence, and faculty development, as well as other administrative issues. The current shortage in senior academic leadership is discussed, as is the question of when a division of child and adolescent psychiatry should become an autonomous department."}, {"Title": "The administration of programs for infants and toddlers.", "Abstract": "In this article, models for providing training in infant and toddler mental health are described. The goal has been to outline programs in enough detail that they may serve as models for persons who wish to develop infant psychiatry training and services within their academic division or their clinical program. From an administrative and fiscal perspective, developing training experiences in infant mental health has many advantages. Consultation experience and clinical experience with infants and young children are training requirements of the psychiatry Residency Review Committee. There is also a workforce shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists and clinicians who can work with children, and there is an even greater shortage of child psychiatrists and psychologists who can work with very young children. This shortage allows a division chief or program director a particular opportunity to earmark core training funding for this underserved area and to partner with affiliated institutions and programs that can help fund these training efforts. The author's program was helped immensely by a private foundation grant, but for the first 20 years it was able to be self-sufficient through a commitment to training and reimbursement for clinical services. Currently, there seems to be an awareness on the part of community and public sector programs that they not only need to pay for trainee time but also must include administrative and faculty time. Finally, experience has defined major important principles of this work with infants, toddlers, and their families. First, training and clinical service must be provided within a context of knowledge and experience in child development. Second, the principles and knowledge of infant mental health must be used. Third, an understanding of relationship-based interventions provided within the context of reflective supervision and mentorship must be provided."}, {"Title": "Early-onset schizophrenia as a progressive-deteriorating developmental disorder: evidence from child psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The developmental perspective as reflected by investigations of childhood and early-onset schizophrenia has become a major research area during recent years and contributed much to the understanding of schizophrenia at all ages. This paper reviews clinical features, neurobiological and neuropsychological findings in childhood and adolescent onset schizophrenia including some results of studies of the author on age at onset, premorbid symptoms, treatment and course. Childhood-onset schizophrenia is a rare disorder with a prevalence of one child in 10,000 before the age of 12 and a remarkable increase around puberty and early adolescence. Developmental events and precursors of schizophrenia cover a wide range of dysfunctions and disturbances including elevated rates of soft neurological signs and birth complications, slow habituation and high baseline autonomic activity, high rate of developmental disorders of speech and/or language and overall and specific cognitive deficits. Brain morphological studies and intelligence testing as well as investigations of the course provide evidence of deterioration. Therefore, early-onset schizophrenia can be understood as a progressive-deteriorating developmental disorder."}, {"Title": "[Max Isserlin, Kantian orientation at K\u00f6nigsberg, psychotherapist with Kraepelin, founder of child psychiatry at Munich, emigrant to Britain].", "Abstract": "This account of the life and work of Max Isserlin (1879 - 1941) wants to be a reminder of a German-Jewish fate next to Kraepelin and as a forced emigrant. Immediately after his studies at K\u00f6nigsberg Isserlin in 1903 came to Kraepelin at Heidelberg, later he followed him to Munich. All his life he kept a Kantian orientation and defended Kraepelin's positions out of this background. Kraepelin entrusted to him all of psychotherapy, theory and practice, which Isserlin for at least 18 years gave courses of in Kraepelin's department. His textbook of psychotherapy thus transmissions Kraepelins convictions about this topic also. During World War I Isserlin was the head of a field-hospital for brain damaged soldiers and continued working this way after the end of the war. Finally he became the founder of child psychiatry in Munich, until he was forced to leave Germany for Britain with a heavy heart."}, {"Title": "Two perspectives on the indicators of quality in psychiatry residencies: program directors' and residents'.", "Abstract": "To determine whether psychiatry program directors and residents agree on the characteristics most important in determining the quality of a residency program.\nThe authors carried out factor analyses of the results of two national surveys that asked participants to rate the importance of 41 items in determining the quality of residency programs: a 1997 survey completed by 180 psychiatry residents and a 1998 survey completed by 234 psychiatry program directors and rotation heads.\nResidents' factors determining program quality were the interpersonal culture in the program, the curriculum, academic resources and opportunities, clinical resources and opportunities, and outcomes. Program directors' factors were program administration, curriculum and clinical resources, the quality of the institution, the supportiveness of the program, and individual preferences.\nProgram directors and residents focus on different indicators of the quality of residency programs, differences that can be conceptualized as those between the \"producer\" and the \"consumer\" of the program. Four domains appear to underlie the results of the resident and faculty factor analyses: the context, content, culture, and consequences of the program. Multidimensional evaluations by multiple stakeholders may be the most appropriate way to evaluate the quality of residency programs. These results also strongly suggest that the interpersonal culture of a program should be assessed as part of its evaluation process."}, {"Title": "Assessment and measurement in neuropsychiatry: a conceptual history.", "Abstract": "Since the time the parent discipline of psychiatry became organized as a profession, one of its ludi saeculares (neuropsychiatry) has enjoyed at least 4 vogues. On each, neuropsychiatry has been known to ally itself to a cause: currently it is the big business of neurobiology. This move can be seen as scientific progress or as a side-effect of the (professional rather than scientific) infighting that affected neuromedicine during the late 19(th) century and which led to the construction of the notion of \"neurological disease.\" Alienists responded to this variously: some, like Kahlbaum and Kraepelin accepted the split and returned to the more botanico approach; others, like Ziehen chose psychology; yet others, like Freud, delved in hermeneutics; lastly, there were those, like Meynert, Wernicke, Von Monakow, and Liepmann who sought an accommodation with neurology. Born out of this compromise, neuropsychiatry has remained a blurred activity (whose definitions range from \"psychiatry of neurology\" to a crusade for the \"naturalization of the mind\"). Neuropsychiatric assessment is a methodology designed to collect information about patients whose mental symptoms are thought to be caused by brain disease. When it first appeared, it was torn by the debate between \"nomothetic versus idiographic\" science. For a time, the neuropsychiatry assessment techniques stuck to the old personalized narratives characteristic of 19(th) century \"casenotes\" (trying to meet its descriptive, explanatory, therapeutic, legal, and ethical obligations). But during the late 19(th) century, measurement and quantification became part of the new rhetoric of science. Soon enough this affected psychology in general and neuropsychology in particular and neuropsychiatric assessment followed suit. It has changed little since except that now and again old tests and markers are replaced by more \"reliable\" ones and phenomenological data are squeezed out further. Its laudable enthusiasm for objectivity and truth was ab initio justified by 19(th) century Positivism; currently, it seems to be supported by a na\u00efve version of Popperian falsificationism. In the meantime, the scientific worth of the neuropsychiatric assessment remains unclear; indeed, in an age of evidence-based medicine, it is surprising that both its informational and communicational value and its efficiency as a general epistemic tool have not been subjected to any serious empirical testing."}, {"Title": "Twin studies in psychiatry and psychology: science or pseudoscience?", "Abstract": "Twin studies are frequently cited in support of the influence of genetic factors for a wide range of psychiatric conditions and psychological trait differences. The most common method, known as the classical twin method, compares the concordance rates or correlations of reared-together identical (MZ) vs. reared-together same-sex fraternal (DZ) twins. However, drawing genetic inferences from MZ-DZ comparisons is problematic due to methodological problems and questionable assumptions. It is argued that the main theoretical assumption of the twin method--known as the \"equal environment assumption\"--is not tenable. The twin method is therefore of doubtful value as an indicator of genetic influences. Studies of reared-apart twins are discussed, and it is noted that these studies are also vulnerable to methodological problems and environmental confounds. It is concluded that there is little reason to believe that twin studies provide evidence in favor of genetic influences on psychiatric disorders and human behavioral differences."}, {"Title": "Rehab rounds: training professionals in use of positive methods for community integration of persons with developmental disabilities.", "Abstract": "Mainstream psychiatry has all but ignored the clinical needs of persons with developmental disabilities. With some notable exceptions, individuals in this group have been served in the community by behaviorally oriented psychologists or relegated to long-term institutional care. However, effective interventions are available, beginning with a functional analysis of the antecedents and consequences of targeted problem behaviors. Procedures for building adaptive coping and functional skills or compensating for their deficiency have been developed that are based on skills training, wraparound supports for employment and community living, stimulus control, and contingencies of reinforcement. Applied behavior analysis using task analysis, stimulus control, and contingencies of reinforcement also spawned some of the first techniques--including the token economy--shown to improve functioning and reduce psychopathology among persons with schizophrenia. One of the premier organizations to have documented the efficacy of person-centered, behavior-analytic, and community-based wraparound support services for persons with developmental disabilities is the Institute for Applied Behavior Analysis in Los Angeles. The institute was founded 20 years ago and has served more than 1,000 children, adolescents, and adults with developmental disabilities. Its staff have designed and empirically validated nonaversive techniques for modifying the behaviors that place their clients or others at risk of harm or injury and that often lead to the clients' ejection or isolation from community life. In this Rehab Rounds column the authors describe and evaluate the institute's training and consultation activities."}, {"Title": "The case against \"the evidence\": a different perspective on evidence-based medicine.", "Abstract": "An evidenced-based approach to psychiatry is playing an increasingly prominent role in treatment decision-making for individual patients and for populations. Many doctors are now critical of the emphasis being placed on \"the evidence\" and concerned that clinical practice will become more constrained.\nTo demonstrate that evidence-based medicine is not new, sources of evidence are limited and psychosocial aspects of medicine are neglected in this process.\nSome of the literature is reviewed. Ideas and arguments are synthesised into a critical commentary.\nThese are considered under four headings: evidence-based medicine is not new; what evidence is acceptable; the doctor as therapist; and the emergence of a new utilitarian orthodoxy.\nIt is agreed that a degree of professional consensus is necessary. However, too great an emphasis on evidence-based medicine oversimplifies the complex and interpersonal nature of clinical care."}, {"Title": "Olanzapine oro-dispersible (Velotab TM ) - an alternative to depot?", "Abstract": "Olanzapine oro-dispersible (Velotab TM ) was introduced to the United Kingdom in May 2000. It rapidly dissolves in the mouth, and therefore patients may find it preferable to swallowing tablets. Another advantage is that the opportunity to hide the medication is much reduced. The study examined the usage of Velotab TM in a forensic psychiatry setting.\nDrug expenditure for different classes of antipsychotic was examined for 6 months before and 7 months after the introduction of olanzapine Velotab TM .\nThe results showed a change in prescribing practice, with a significant inverse correlation between the use of Velotab TM and depot medication.\nThis suggests that forensic psychiatrists, who may have particular concerns about compliance, had confidence in oro-dispersible administration as an alternative to depot medication. It is suggested that making other neuroleptics available in an oro-dispersible form would allow for a wider choice of atypicals in populations in whom there are significant compliance problems.

Diagnostic guidelines in both ICD10 and DSM-IV are stated to be based on the \"clinical description of the variety of concepts\" and are based on the subjective complaints, i.e. symptoms.\nIn particular, we argue that no significant effort has been made to segregate the presence of accompanying physical signs in Major Depressive Illness, DSM-IV 296.2x, and Panic Disorder Without Agoraphobia, DSM-IV 300.01.\nThese physical signs are psychophysiological correlates of clinically significant depression and anxiety. Advances in structural biology, genetic engineering and brain imaging provide an opportunity to narrow the gap between physical signs and psychiatric symptoms in psychiatry.\nTherefore we suggest that the next revisions of the DSM and the ICD classifications lead the way in incorporating physical signs alongside those symptoms pertaining to each psychiatric illness.

Each succeeding Diagnostic and Statistical Manual has broadened the concept of pain disorders, and, gradually, the diagnosis has become increasingly removed from the original idea of \"psychogenic pain.\" The advantage of this broadening has been the increased use of the diagnosis in clinical settings. However, there remains a problem of validity, as the disorder continues to imply a mind-body dualism, and clinicians are asked to determine the relative contribution of both to the overall picture of pain. After examining this problem, the article looks at some alternative models, and offers some generalizations regarding the dimensions of the pain experience. The article ends by tentatively offering some suggestions for future approaches to pain diagnoses in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Efficacy of brief dynamic psychotherapy for children with emotional disorders.", "Abstract": "Child psychiatry has enjoyed a long tradition of using brief psychotherapy with children, but research on its efficacy and effectiveness in the setting of routine clinical care is remarkably sparse; the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an original model of brief psychodynamic psychotherapy (BPP) for children with emotional disorders in a clinical outpatient setting.\nA sample of 30 subjects (6.3-10.9 years old) was divided into an experimental BPP group and a control group. Each subject was evaluated at the beginning, after 6 months and at an 18-months follow-up. Outcome measures were Children's Global Assessment Scale and Child Behavior Check-List. Statistical and clinical significance of change were evaluated.\nAt the first evaluation, the experimental group showed a better improvement in global functioning; at follow-up, the two groups improved to a comparable degree, but only the mean of the experimental group moved to a functional range. The experimental group showed a significant reduction in total behavioral problems and externalizing problems at the follow-up.\nThe better improvement of the experimental group in two outcome measures suggests that BPP is efficient in emotional disorders. The hypothesis that BPP introduces changes at long term (sleeper effects) is suggested. The improvement in global functioning of the two groups is discussed in relation to specific characteristics of emotional disorders. Finally, limitations of the study are discussed and in particular the bias introduced by lack of randomization."}]
