[{"Title": "A comparison of the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) in severely depressed patients.", "Abstract": "We set out to examine the psychometric properties of the MDI in comparison to the BDI in a mixed group of patients with primary depression.\nAt the Department of Biological Psychiatry in Vienna currently depressed inpatients with either a depressive or a schizo-affective disorder filled out both MDI and BDI on day of admission and at a time-point two weeks later during their treatment. Furthermore the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) was administered by the treating clinician at both time-points.\nIn total, 51 patients were included in the study. The non-parametric item response analysis was preferred to the classical Cronbach coefficient \u03b1 as the latter is influenced by the number of items in a questionnaire. MDI obtained a Mokken analysis coefficient above 0.40, indicating unidimensionality. To determine external validity severely depressed patients with psychotic symptoms (N = 10) were compared to the remaining non-psychotic depressed patients (N = 41). Although BDI and MDI showed a lower score for psychotic than for non-psychotic inpatients, the standard deviations for both were greater for psychotic inpatients. On the intercorrelations between the different scales, MDI showed for all coefficients values above 0.70. On the other hand BDI and MDI both showed the same degree of linear relationship as the usual versions of HAM-D.\nOur results demonstrate that the MDI had the highest coefficients values and was sufficient as a measure for depressive disorders in psychiatric patients."}, {"Title": "Prevalence and predictors of poor medication adherence among out-patients at a psychiatric hospital in Benin City, Nigeria.", "Abstract": "To determine the prevalence and predictors of poor or non-compliance with medications among respondents attending an adult psychiatry out-patient clinic in Benin City, Nigeria.\nRespondents (n = 137) were randomly selected over a 3-month period using a cross-sectional study design. They were administered a questionnaire adapting the Factors Influencing Neuroleptic Medication Taking Scale as well as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) to ascertain medication, illness-related and psychosocial variables. Medication adherence was determined by self report and for the purpose of the study confined to the week prior to interview.\nAlmost half (42.3%) were poorly adherent to medications. Most admitted to good psychosocial support, but believed that their illness had a spiritual aetiology. Stigma, higher frequency of medication dosing as well as illness severity as measured by their BPRS scores were significant predictors of poor medication adherence.\nThe prevalence of poor medication adherence in this environment is higher than in studies from Western cultures, and replicates rates from previously published reports in this environment. Factors responsible for poor adherence can form the template for intervention studies and programs to improve compliance."}, {"Title": "Effect of communication skill training using group psychoeducation method on the stress level of psychiatry ward nurses.", "Abstract": "Nursing is a dynamic and supportive job, with the main role of taking care of patients. Maintaining appropriate communication of the nurse with the patients is particularly known as the main core of care in mental health. However, in spite of the importance of providing communication, one of the main sources of stress in nurses of psychiatry wards is communication with the patients. Some important reasons for inappropriate relationship between the nurse and patient can be lack of necessary skills to communicate with patients because of insufficient training. Although training communication skills is an important part of the education of medical and paramedical students, in recent studies it has been demonstrated that the communication skills learned in theoretical courses would not necessarily be transferred to clinical settings, and proving training in clinical settings is a must. The present study was carried out to determine the effect of training communication skills using psychoeducation method on the stress level of nurses of psychiatry wards in 2010.\nThis is a quasi-experimental study. The participants were 45 nurses; 23 and 22 in the experiment and control groups, respectively, working in psychiatry wards of Noor and Farabi hospitals, Isfahan, Iran. The sampling was carried out by the census method, and then the participants were randomly assigned to the two groups of experiment and control, using random number table. The two groups filled out the demographic data form and also the questionnaire on nurses' occupational stress, designed by the researcher. The questionnaire was filled out three times; before, immediately after, and one month after the training. Training of communication skills was carried out using group psychoeducation method, in six sessions, each lasted for 1.5 hours. The training sessions of the experiment group were held in Farabi Hospital.\nThe findings indicated that before the intervention, the members of the two groups had a high level of occupational stress. Immediately after the training, the stress level of the experiment group decreased significantly, and the decrease was sustained for the following one month.\nTraining communicative skills using group psychoeducation method can decrease the occupational stress of psychiatry ward nurses."}, {"Title": "Disease mongering in psychiatry: fact or fiction?", "Abstract": "Disease mongering starts at the top of recent accusations being hurled at psychiatry.

Cenesthesia refers to the internal, global, implicit and affective perception of one's own body. The concept of cenesthopathy was coined by Dupre and Camus in 1907 to describe a clinical entity characterized by abnormal and strange bodily sensations.\nIn this review, we examine the history of these concepts and the influence they have had on clinical, nosographical and phenomenological psychiatry and on cognitive neuropsychiatry.\nWe performed a narrative review of the published research literature.\nClassical French and German psychiatrists have written extensively on cenesthesia and cenesthopathy although these notions are no longer in the mainstream of contemporary psychiatry. However, they are still present in contemporary psychiatric nosography in the form of some controversial clinical entities clearly related to cenesthesia such as cenesthetic schizophrenia, hypochondriacal monothematic delusions, or the Capgras and the Cotard syndromes. These clinical entities are all associated with a state of depersonalization. We point out the similarities between Ey's description of the depersonalization syndrome, especially in psychosis, and the characteristics of cenesthesia. Philosophers like Sartre or Merleau-Ponty have developed the concept of cenesthesia, and in particular have added new concepts like \"body schema\". Similarly, phenomenological psychiatrists like Minkowski or Tellenbach have attempted to describe psychiatric disorders associated with cenesthesia and have also proposed new concepts (i.e. atmospheric sense) in order to understand them better. More recently, cognitive neuropsychiatry has tried to discover the mechanisms, which cause or contribute to the genesis of delusions. The majority of delusion theories developed in cognitive neuropsychiatry consider that the explanation of monothematic delusions involves one or two explanatory stages. The first stage corresponds to an abnormal experience (the experiential stage) while the second is related to abnormal reasoning (the inferential stage). This theoretical first stage has been considered to be the result of a highly unusual or bizarre perceptual experience. According to the authors, this experience refers to a phenomenon of depersonalization, a loss of cenesthesia, or a loss of a feeling of familiarity. For example, the neurocognitive models of the Capgras and Cotard syndromes have in common the belief that they are both based on various kinds of unusual experiences. These unusual experiences are thought to include affective or emotional experiences. Capgras' syndrome is possibly triggered by an abnormal affective experience in response to the sight of closed-person's face. Similarly, the Cotard syndrome may result from a general flattening of affective responses to external stimuli. The inferential stage can also differentiate between the two syndromes. Some empirical validation has already been obtained in Capgras' syndrome but not yet in Cotard's syndrome.\nThis review illustrates that the historical descriptions of cenesthesia and cenesthopathy remain relevant in contemporary neurocognitive models and more generally suggests that the comprehension of quite complex phenomena like delusion requires a multidisciplinary approach."}, {"Title": "[Validation study of the French schizotypal personality questionnaire in a sample of adolescents: a confirmatory factor analysis].", "Abstract": "This article aims to validate the schizotypal personality questionnaire in a sample of French speaking adolescents. Because early schizotypal manifestations are predictive of psychosis-proneness, reliable self-report measures are crucial for early detection of vulnerability to schizophrenia during adolescence. Unlike most existing self-reports, the questionnaire de personnalit\u00e9 schizotypique (SPQ) assesses individual differences in all nine feature of DSM-IV schizotypal personality (i.e. ideas of reference, excessive social anxiety, odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experience, odd behaviour, no close friends, odd speech, constricted affect and suspiciousness). Furthermore, it yields dimensional scores concerning the main schizotypal factors, which represent valuable information for the clinician's case formulation and can be used as a screening instrument in the general population.\nOur sample consisted of 174 adolescents (98 girls) between 12 and 17 years old. All completed the SPQ 74-item self-report. Participants were recruited in secondary schools in Switzerland, and through the child and adolescent community outpatient psychiatric service (office m\u00e9dico-p\u00e9dagogique) affiliated to the University of Geneva's Psychiatry Department and to the Canton of Geneva Education Department. A confirmatory factorial analysis was conducted on our sample to test nine competing models of SPQ. The 3-factor model of Raine et al. was compared to concurrent 2, 3, and 4-factor models. Simple structure models of Raine et al. and Stefanis et al. were also tested.\nThe following observations were highlighted in our results: (1) goodness-of-fit indices are better for structures allowing cross loadings than for simple structures; (2) amongst the simple structures, the best goodness-of-fit index was obtained for the Raine model and (3) the fit between our data and the Raine model is improved by a cross loading for suspiciousness subscale. The latter seems problematic for the global data fitting. This led us to test simple structures models of Siever and Gunderson, Raine et al., and Stefanis et al., based on eight subscales rather than nine. Without suspiciousness subscale, goodness-of-fit indices are enhanced in these three models. The 3-factor model yields the clearest and most reliable results in comparison with other competing models. In summary, the best goodness-of-fit indices were obtained for the 3-factor Raine model. Goodness-of-fit indices could be improved by the exclusion of the suspiciousness scale.\nConsistent with earlier analyses by Raine et al. and Dumas et al., our data confirm the 3-factor model of the SPQ (cognitive-perceptive; interpersonal; disorganized) in a sample of French speaking adolescents. Our analyses confirm that two dimensions are insufficient to explain the structure of schizotypy during adolescence. These results further suggest the stability of a 3-factor structure during lifespan. We note that the inclusion of the suspiciousness subscales engenders statistical issues. Most studies to date have dealt with these issues by performing a cross-loading with this subscale, or by the inclusion of a paranoid factor which is linked with the negative and the cognitive-perceptive factors. We found that the most statistically sound strategy was reached without the inclusion of the suspiciousness subscale. Future studies with larger samples could investigate the SPQ structure at an item-level, which carries the benefit of reduced restrictions on the factorial analysis. In conclusion, the current study shows that the French version SPQ constitutes a reliable self-report questionnaire for the assessment of schizotypal trait expression during adolescence that may assist in the evaluation of psychosis proneness in youths."}, {"Title": "Postgraduate year-1 residency training in emergency psychiatry: an acute care psychiatric clinic at a community mental health center.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine resident satisfaction with an acute care psychiatric clinic designed in collaboration with a nearby community mental health center.

The DALY estimation clearly shows that psychiatric disorders are the top source for burden of diseases to the individual life and society. Schizophrenia is a most devastating psychiatric disorder in which the onset is usually at youth and the cognitive dysfunction persists for life-long in some patients. Schizophrenia is associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities. It has been unknown whether post-onset progressive pathology is also present in schizophrenia until the recent sophistication of in vivo neuroimaging techniques. Longitudinal neuroimaging studies on first-episode schizophrenia have shown a progressive deterioration of structure and function of neocortical regions in the early stage of the disorder. Insult to dendritic spines through glutamatergic dysfunction may underlie this process, which may in turn be a promising molecular target for intervention to improve the functional outcome of schizophrenia. More recently, the question of whether early intervention can be targeted at prodromal stage of schizophrenia has called special attention in psychiatry. In University of Tokyo, the integrative neuroimaging studies for schizophrenia targeting early intervention and prevention (IN-STEP) is ongoing. Through these efforts, we would like to contribute to the establishment of \"youth mental health\", where every youth in the community can know, prevent, and have easy access to needs- and value-based services, and pursue mental well-being and recovery."}, {"Title": "Depression in mild dementia: associations with diagnosis, APOE genotype and clinical features.", "Abstract": "Depression is common in dementia, with important clinical implications.

Bleuler was already well known in Britain before his schizophrenia book appeared, with the journals containing numerous references, mainly positive, to his work. The psychiatry textbooks, however, were slower to integrate his contribution.

Seclusion continues to be widely used in the management of disturbed behaviour in hospitalized patients. Although recent studies serve to strengthen the link between the use of seclusion and negative patient responses, they are limited in extending our understanding of the seclusion experience. The objective of this work was two-fold: to examine the perceptions and experiences of patients about their seclusion experience and then suggest ways of improving the use of seclusion in relation to an ethical perspective.\nWe conducted face-to-face semi-structured interviews with inpatients in a French Public Psychiatric Hospital, 3 weeks after their seclusion. They were conducted until no new ideas emerged in the content analysis, comprising 30 patients. Interviews were conducted using an interview guide by a physician. Specific attention was paid to their perceptions of seclusion. This guide was based on the concepts of medical ethics (autonomy, beneficence, non-malfeasance). Interviews were retranscribed and content analysis was performed by two of the authors who were skilled in textual analysis. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0 software.\nAutonomy was challenged by 50% of interviewed patients. For 70% of patients, there was a lack of information and explanation during the seclusion on therapeutics, practices, procedures, expected length of time in seclusion and behaviours. This can contribute to perception of this process as punishment expressed by the patients. The dominant view of patients was that more effective communication about seclusion was needed. A majority of patients perceived the beneficence of the health professionals even if most of them did not express a benefit from this experience: only 26% believed that seclusion made them calm down and 36% that seclusion helped them to feel and behave better. The level and the quality of the relationship with staff during and following the seclusion experience was a major source of satisfaction for patients and can counter-balance their negative perception of seclusion. The non-malfeasance was questioned by patients. The therapeutic value of seclusion was not recognized by a majority of them. Seclusion from the patient's perspective appears to invoke a complex range of feelings that include helplessness (76%), anger (60%), humiliation (60%), depression (50%), and fear (63%). For 60% of patients, the act of placing them in seclusion had a profound negative impact. Seventy-six percent of them considered that seclusion could be prevented.\nDespite advances in our knowledge and understanding of mental illness, seclusion continues, and is likely to continue, as a treatment option for a number of patients. In our study, a certain number of trends were observed. Globally, there is some tension concerning ethical principles. Attention to the specific needs of patients while in seclusion may serve to reduce the punitive connotations linked to the practice. What is needed is a permanent ethical reevaluation of seclusion. For this purpose, healthcare professional staffs may be useful for a truly ethical reflection. The aim is to recognize the patient as the agent of his/her own empowerment through appropriate information. This approach should not only provide the patient with the opportunity to understand why the seclusion occurred, but also some means for overcoming the negative effects of the procedure."}, {"Title": "[Assessment of targeted clinical audit in suicide attempt].", "Abstract": "Suicide attempt is a serious condition that is frequent in France.

The standards from the Anaes had 16 criteria in three fields: care on admission (n=10); assessment of family and social environment (n=2); management for after hospital care (n=4). A project manager and a MD certified in health care quality supported the medical (MD certified in acute care and in psychiatry) and nursing staff of the emergency wards. All the wards analyzed 30 patients' files for the first cycle, set up and implemented improvement actions and then performed the second cycle of data collection.\nAll wards fully satisfied the protocol with 30 patients' files per cycle and two cycles. In all wards the teams consisted of physicians (both certified for emergency or psychiatry) and others care providers (nurses, psychologists, social workers, secretary). For the first cycle, three criteria (patient assessment, somatic examination and coordination) met the 100% target for more than half of the wards while three criteria (sociofamily and environmental evaluation, management for after hospital care, monitoring of follow-up) did not conform by more than 50% in more than half of the wards. All wards implemented changes after the first cycle with a total of 29 interventions, each one specifically devoted to improving a particular criterion. Intervention included better coordination and communication, protocol design and reminders, and information tools. The second cycle showed modest and mixed changes. After the interventions only one criteria reached the 100% target in one ward; the degree of conformity decreased in nine cases (with a mean of -23%) and increased in 16 cases (+19%).

Most men (56%) were less than 30 years old whereas 60.6% of women were within 30-59 years aged bracket. For men the main diagnosis was schizophrenia (30.5%), followed by substance related disorders (16.5%) then depression (14.0%); for women the main diagnosis was also schizophrenia (30.3%), this was followed by depression (24.5%), only one woman was diagnosed with substance related disorder. A statistically significant association was also found between having a personality disorder and being a male (p = 0.009). Most female were single and belong to the lowest occupational group. There was no significant difference in the gender distribution of patients with respect to length of stay on admission (p = 0.161).\nThe results revealed how psychiatry diagnosis is significantly influence by gender issues.

Patients suffering from these disorders do not seek to obtain immediate secondary benefits, contrary to simulation. They send the physician a challenge, sometimes by means of self-mutilation, or exposure to a vital risk. Their objective is to raise the interest and the mobilization of the medical community. The patient will develop intense relationships with the medical staff, technically mobilized as well as emotionally, as far as the factitious character of the disorder is uncovered. In some cases, factious disorders are conditions in which a person acts as if he or she has a psychiatric disorder, by deliberately exhibiting psychiatric symptoms. Most often described are factitious acute psychotic disorders, mourning, affective disorders and post-traumatic stress disorders. Psychiatric factitious disorders are difficult to diagnose, but they share common diagnosis criteria with other pathomimias. These subjects may suffer from pathomimia because of the occurrence of other psychiatric symptoms, such as pathological personalities, adaptation disorders, abuse and/or dependence on alcohol or other substances, or depressive disorders. This paper describes three clinical cases of pathomimia, diagnosed after hospitalization in a psychiatric unit for depressive symptoms, as a correlate to their factitious or authentic character.\nThree case reports, describing patients with pathomimia hospitalized in a department of psychiatry for depressive disorders.\nThe first case was a 57 year-old man considered as suffering from a bipolar disorder hospitalized for a depressive syndrome. The symptoms described and reported are those of a factitious disorder. The patient interrupted the medical care by asking to be discharged from the hospital. The second case was a young woman hospitalized following a suicide attempt. She has a history of multiple somatic and psychiatric factitious disorders. On admission she had depressive symptoms, more likely linked with a pathological personality, rather than with a major depressive episode. The third case presented a Munchausen syndrome. He was hospitalized for depressive symptoms. He had a comorbid major depressive episode. The prescription of antidepressants led to a significant clinical improvement.\nThese three cases indicate that a real depressive syndrome may be observed with a patient suffering from pathomimia. Therefore, a neutral and complete psychiatric evaluation is necessary so as to not deprive these patients from the opportunity for an adapted treatment."}, {"Title": "[Hollingshead and Redlich: research on social class and mental illness fifty years after].", "Abstract": "This article examines the book Social class and mental illness: a community study by A.B.

The aim is to deliver an accessible, responsive, cost-effective, rolled-out service. Consultant gastroenterologists, a specialist liaison psychiatrist, psychiatric alcohol liaison nurse, gastroenterology-based liver nurse practitioner and ward nurses provide joint inpatient and outpatient care for people with alcohol misuse, especially alcohol-related liver disease. A ward based, consultant-led, multidisciplinary team, with a dedicated social worker, meets daily to discuss all inpatients, unify treatment and facilitate discharges. On Monday-Friday, the two alcohol specialist nurses assess, triage and give brief advice to all alcohol-related medical admissions, liaise with consultants about admission or arrange outpatient appointments with the community alcohol team. This has reduced the average length of stay from 8.0 days to 5.7 days, saving the Trust more than 1000 bed days annually. This highlights the need for a 7 day alcohol specialist nurse service, one of 11 key recommendations in a recent position paper by the British Society of Gastroenterology, Alcohol Health Alliance UK and British Association for Study of the Liver on future alcohol care required in British district general hospitals.

Such presumed causality is the basis of evidence-based psychiatry. We examined the strengths and weaknesses of research onto the causality of relationship between diagnosis and therapy of major depressive disorder and suggest what could be done to strengthen eventual claims on causality. Four obstacles for a rational evidence-based psychiatry were recognised. First, current classification systems are scientifically nonfalsifiable. Second, cerebral processes are-at least to some extent-nondeterministic, i.e. they are random, stochastic and/or chaotic. Third, the vague or lack of relationship between therapeutic regimens and suspected pathogenesis. Fourth, the inadequacy of tools to diagnose and delineate a functional disorder. We suggest a strategy to identify diagnostic prototypes that are characterised by a limited number of parameters (symptoms, markers and other characteristics).

The directors of nursing answered questions concerning policies about and use of antipsychotic medications.\nThe most commonly reported intervention to manage symptoms in residents with dementia since the black box warning was to lower doses of antipsychotics. Over half of facilities report obtaining more frequent psychiatry/psychology consults. One-hundred seven facilities have a policy regarding informing family members of residents about the black box warning. Most facilities (63.6%) with a policy require family to sign consent. In the NH setting, the presence or absence of a policy did not correlate with the reported change in use of antipsychotics or types of alternative interventions.\nNotably, a large number of NH facilities have policies regarding informed consent on the use of antipsychotics. However, in our study, the rate of use of antipsychotics did not change in many facilities since the black box warning. In addition, having a policy did not correlate with decreased antipsychotic use or with use of alternate agents or nonpharmacologic methods to address symptoms. The results of this survey suggest that NH administrators should worry less about the legal exposure of using antipsychotics and focus on actions that result in improved patient care."}, {"Title": "Neurocognitive correlates of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in a Turkish sample.", "Abstract": "We established a neuropsychological testing profile among Turkish adults presenting with ADHD controlling for general intelligence and comorbid psychiatric conditions. Adults with ADHD frequently present with comorbid conditions (e.g., mood and substance use/abuse disorders) that may have a detrimental impact on neurocognitive function. Hence, we excluded patients with ADHD meeting criteria for comorbid psychiatric syndromes. A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery was administered to adults with ADHD attending a general psychiatry clinic in Istanbul, Turkey, and healthy control participants. Adults with ADHD demonstrated performance deficits on tests of attention, information processing speed, and general and working memory. Patients with ADHD also reported a significantly greater number of symptoms associated with frontal lobe syndromes (i.e., dysexecutive symptoms and disinhibition). Patients with ADHD demonstrated rather striking deficits on tests of verbal and nonverbal memory. Once information was encoded, however, patients with ADHD do not demonstrate significant information loss. Patients with ADHD and healthy controls did not differ on tests of alternation learning, inhibitory control (error rates), and ToM skills. Findings support the contention that dorsal-prefrontal (rather than ventral-prefrontal) dysfunction is associated with adult ADHD. Unexpectedly, groups did not differ on executive control and fluency tasks. Yet patients with ADHD obtained substantially higher scores on a self-report measure of executive dysfunction. This suggests that dysexecutive symptoms among patients with ADHD in the current study do not reflect set-shifting or organizational deficits. Rather, symptoms may reflect attentional and working memory deficits as well as diminished information processing speed."}, {"Title": "The quality of life of children and adolescents with ADHD undergoing outpatient psychiatric treatment: simple disorders of activity and attention and hyperkinetic conduct disorders in comparison with each other and with other diagnostic groups.", "Abstract": "(1) How does the quality of life of patients with ADHD treated in an ambulatory care setting compare to that of other patient groups in child and adolescent psychiatry?

At the intersection of science and the humanities, narratives aid in the interpretation of lived experiences, provide a window to that experience, and a public medium that engages writers and readers as they interpret the world. Engaging narratives to interpret both experience and medical jargon may reveal for both those experiencing depression and those engaged in their care, a way of mediating that experience. Narratives can help dissect and thus illuminate the official language of medicine and psychiatry and the personal language of depression.

It joins in the wider spectre of the interpersonal dependency. More and more patients suffering from this disorder are coming for psychiatric consultation. However, this notion remains vague and absent in the vocabulary of the psychiatrists. Globally, this term describes the functioning of certain patients who present a fear of not being loved and a dependency on another person. The fear of not being loved provokes a fear of abandonment or incites development of strategies to be loved (seduce, help). Dependency on another person is a consequence of the lack of confidence in the capabilities of the individual. The other person reassures them because this person does what the patient is afraid of doing, because he/she does not feel capable. The lack of confidence in own's capabilities can also incite the individual to become a perfectionist and successful. The fear of not being loved and of not being competent is determined partly in the person's childhood. These impressions are real and/or the individuals are hypersensitive.\nThe article describes the emotional, cognitive and behavioural levels, the various types of interpersonal dependency: dependences of type \"umbilical cord\", \"rescuer\", \"stereotype\" and \"against dependence\". The objective is to specify the concept better on clinical level, with the aim of defining criteria and pathological limits. This is the first stage before beginning rigorous scientific research. The stakes are high. There are relationships with anxiety, depressive disorders, alcoholism, food behaviour disorders, suicide and somatic pathologies.\nDependency seems to be the consequence of a pathological expression of the normal dimensions of the personality: the need to be loved and valued (admired). The onset of dependency occurs in stages, when the person is weakened by events of life or by depression. The impression not to have been loved and/or valued in childhood is vulnerability. We detail the common points and the differences between the types of described dependences and the diagnostic categories of the DSM. The category-specific classification of the DSM is not adapted to making a diagnosis in these patients. To diagnose a pathological personality, the patient has to be constantly in a functioning of pathological intensity, which is not still the case. This is a real problem, because these clinical situations are very frequent. We defend a dimensional approach of the personality disorders. A meeting between the psychiatry and the relationally dependent person is possible, on one hand in a dimensional classification of personality disorders and, on the other, by working on self-esteem. The relational dependency and self-esteem share the same appearances and the same causes.

The goal is to both render a precise diagnostic (teleexpertise) and favour assistance and support to residents and their families while instituting a medical education tool for the health professionals of this unit.\nThe creation of this telehealth experience, using multiple contact video conferencing, was possible thanks to the existence of the Megalis network, a high speed telecommunication system deployed in the Britanny and Loire region. The connexion of the two sites is made through Cisco type routers. Both sites are linked to the network through urban fiber optics (2-40 MMytes/s output) or Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Access (64 or 128 kbytes/s output). This virtual private network (VPN) style high speed link offers a transparent and secure connexion through the service provider (Novasight) which supervises the technical organisation and the management of the address books of the various listed sites, controls access to the network and manages the network speed.

His/her functions are to guarantee a precise format for the meeting, to distribute speaking time fairly, to clearly formulate the decisions made (organisation of results, summing up diagnostic results and evaluation of competencies, common institutional actions, arrangement of projects, university research and trainings, scheduling future meetings). Still using their experiences, the authors put forward several recommendations on technology, video and audio links (framing, sound checks, multidirectional microphones, video quality - forcing people to limit rapid gestures\u2026) but also insist on having fit for purpose rooms (soundproofing, neutral decor, homogenous lighting, neon for example\u2026). Contact with patients and their family through video-conference: despite being used less, this technique has shown its pertinence especially for the evaluation of diagnostics and competencies.

To detect and evaluate affective spectrum disorders, all the enrolled patients were interviewed on days 2-3 of AMI, by using the screening questionnaire developed at the Moscow Research Institute of Psychiatry (MRIP), Russian Agency for Health Care, and 4-5 days and 2 and 6 months after the onset of AMI they underwent an in-depth psychopathological examination by a psychiatrist who applied the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS). To correct affective symptomatology in some patients with verified depression, the antidepressant tianeptin was added to the conventional therapy for AMI on its days 5-7.\nThe screening questionnaire study revealed depressive spectrum disorders in 45.4% of the patients with AMI. The in-depth psychopathological examination confirmed the presence of AD in 40.7%. Mild and moderate depressive episodes were observed in 26.9% of the patients and adjustment disorders were seen in 13.8%. The sensitivity and specificity of the MRIP screening questionnaire for the diagnosis of depressive spectrum disorders in patients with AIM was 86.2 and 69.6%, respectively. The concomitant symptoms of anxiety were detected in 27.8% of the patients with AMI. The duration of a course of antidepressant therapy with tianeptin averaged 3.9 +/- 1.1 months. Six moths after AMI, the tianeptin group a showed significant reduction in HDRS scores by 50% (p = 0.0013) and in HARS scores by 52.7% (p = 0.0004) versus the baseline values. During a follow-up, there was no significant decrease in HDRS and HARS scores in a group of patients who refused antidepressant therapy.\nAffective spectrum disorders are most common in myocardial infarction (MI). The use of the MRIP screening questionnaire favors a more adequate diagnosis of depressive spectrum disorders in patients with AMI. Tianeptin therapy for AD concurrent with MI causes an evident reduction in psychopathological symptomatology and a statistically significant decrease in HDRS and HARS scores."}, {"Title": "Prevention in psychiatry: effects of healthy lifestyle on cognition.", "Abstract": "People are living longer than ever.

In this article, I argue that rather than attacking schizophrenia for its lack of scientific validity, we should focus on the conceptual history of this label. I reconstruct a specific tradition when exploring the conceptual history of schizophrenia. This is the concern with the question of the sense of life itself, conducted through the confrontation with schizophrenia as a form of life that does not live, or as Robert Jay Lifton termed it \"lifeless life\" (1979: 222-39). I conclude by arguing that the contemporary attempt to deconstruct or abolish the schizophrenia concept involves a fundamental shift in concern. The attempt both to normalize psychotic experiences, and to conceive them purely in terms of cognitive processes that can be mapped onto brain function, results in a fundamental move away from the attempt to understand the experience of madness."}, {"Title": "The noncompliant patient in psychiatry: the case for and against covert/surreptitious medication.", "Abstract": "Nonadherence to treatment continues to be one of psychiatry's greatest challenges. To improve adherence and thus improve the care of patients, clinicians and patients' family members sometimes resort to hiding medication in food or drink, a practice referred to as covert/ surreptitious medication. The practice of covert drug administration in food and beverages is well known in the treatment of psychiatrically ill world-wide but no prevalence rates exist. Covert medication may seem like a minor matter, but it touches on legal and ethical issues of a patient's competence, autonomy, and insight. Medicating patients without their knowledge is not justifiable solely as a shortcut for institutions or families wishing to calm a troublesome patient and thus alleviate some of the burdens of care giving. The paramount principle is ensuring the well-being of a patient who lacks the competence to give informed consent. Ethically, covert/surreptitious administration can be seen as a breach of trust by the doctor or by family members who administer the drugs. Covert medication contravenes contemporary ethical practice. Legally, treatment without consent is permissible only where common law or statute provides such authority. The practice of covert administration of medication is not specifically covered in the mental health legislation in developing countries. Many of the current dilemmas in this area have come to public attention because of two important developments in medical ethics and the law - the increasing importance accorded to respect for autonomy and loss of the parens patriae jurisdiction of the courts [parens patriae means 'parent of the country'; it permitted a court to consent or refuse treatment on behalf of an 'incapacity', or alternatively to appoint a guardian with such powers]."}, {"Title": "Inpatient psychiatry: why do we need it?", "Abstract": "The author makes the case for the necessity of inpatient psychiatric services in a comprehensive, community based, system of care.

The U.K. experience.", "Abstract": "Locating psychiatric wards in general hospitals has long been seen in many countries as a key element in the reform of services to promote community integration of the mentally ill. In the U.K., however, this is no longer a policy priority, and the recent trend has been towards small freestanding inpatient units, located either within the communities they serve, or on general hospital sites, but separate from the main building. Whether locating the psychiatric wards in the general hospital is essential to psychiatric reform has been little discussed, and we can find no relevant evidence. Perceived strengths of general hospital psychiatric wards are in normalisation of mental health problems, accessibility to local communities, better availability of physical health care resources, and integration of psychiatry with the rest of the medical profession, which may faclilitate recruitment. However, difficulties seem to have been encountered in establishing well-designed psychiatric wards with access to open space in general hospitals. Also, physical proximity may not be enough to achieve the desired reduction in stigma, and complaints from the general hospital may sometimes result in undue restrictions on psychiatric ward patients. There are strong arguments both for and against locating psychiatric wards in general hospitals: an empirical evidence base would be helpful to inform important decisions about the best setting for wards."}, {"Title": "Geriatric psychiatry--an emerging specialty.", "Abstract": "This paper reviews the emergence of geriatric psychiatry in the United States and Missouri.

Although understanding the brain anatomy and its functional organization provided a first and indispensable foundation, it became clear that a static view was insufficient. To understand the complexity of neuronal communication, it is necessary to examine the chemical nature of the neurotransmission and, using the example of the acetylcholine receptors, follow the different layers of networks that can be distinguished. The natural alkaloid nicotine contained in tobacco leaves acts as an agonist with a subclass of acetylcholine receptors, and provides an interesting tool to approach brain functions. Analysis of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are ligand gated channels, revealed that these receptors are expressed at different critical locations on the neurons including the synaptic boutons, neurites, cell bodies, and even on the axons. These receptors can modulate the activity at the microcircuit synaptic level, in the cell processing of information, and, by acting on the velocity of action potential, the synchrony of communication between brain areas. These actions at multiple levels of brain organization provide an example of the complexity of brain neurocircuitry and an illustration of the relevance of this knowledge for psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Neuroimaging techniques in modern forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Applied neuroscientific knowledge such as brain neuroimaging has widespread application in the medical diagnostic and treatment areas. Neuroscientific progress such as cognitive neuroscience has strong implications in specific medical fields such as forensic psychiatry. Significant progress in forensic psychiatry has affected the practice of law, in which an understanding of the complex relationship among mind, brain, and behavior is becoming necessary. Forensic psychiatry is concerned with the relationship between psychiatric abnormalities and legal violations and crimes. Due to the lack of available biological criteria, assessment, evaluation and therapy in forensic psychiatry have so far been restricted to psychosocial and mental criteria of offender personality. Recent advances in nuclear radiology such as brain imaging techniques (fMRI, DT-MRI, PET SPECT) allow a closer approach to the neural correlates of personality, moral judgments and decision-making. Introduction of neurobiological criteria (based on advanced neuroimaging techniques) in the field of forensic psychiatry and establishing the rules to what extent such biological criteria will be more reliable choice in evaluating mentally ill offenders would be of fundamental value in the modern forensic psychiatry.

We aimed to bring together in one place all the studies which have been carried out, up till mid 2009, in order to demonstrate the evidence that shared collaborative care has important advantages in terms both of depression outcomes and cost benefits, in order to argue for the adoption of this approach in the United Kingdom and n Europe.\nwe carried out a literature search using PUBMED in order to identify and describe all trials, systematic reviews and Metanalyses which have been carried out on shared care until mid 2009. We also described a shared care service for depression which some of us had been involved in developing and working in in Luton in the late 1990's. We have excluded papers which describe trials which have not yet been carried out, and instead focussed on the trials which have reported.\nit has been demonstrated in numerous recent studies that shared care in the treatment of depression, which includes the training of General Practitoners in the treatment of depression, and the provision in Primary Care of a Nurse specialist or another professional who will impart psycho-education, ensure concordance with medication, and may provide psychotherapy, leads to both improved treatment outcomes and increased doctor and patient satisfaction, as well providing some cost-benefits, despite somewhat increased immediate costs. This is the case in both adult and adolescent patients, while in the case of diabetic patients depression is improved, despite the lack of improvement in glycaemic control. The shared care intervention continues to be useful in the case of patients with resistant depressive symptoms, though a longer input will be necessary in such cases. Patients with subthreshold depression will not benefit as much, and patients expressed more satisfaction when psychological interventions were offered. It is also the case that collaborative or shared care is effective in treating depression in the elderly. This is shown by studies which include older patients who also suffer from multiple health conditions, arthritis, diabetes, anxiety and PTSD, the poorer, those with suicidal ideation, and also in Ethnic Minorities.\nThe results described above are mostly based on studies carried out in the USA, but similar studies have been reported from the United Kingdom, and are consistent with the experience of the service in Luton which we describe. From these results it would seem important that shared, collaborative care, with primary and secondary care doctors (General Practitioners and Psychiatrists) working as part of a single team, with the help of mental health practitioners attached to primary care, but with easy access to secondary care is a productive way of optimising the treatment of depression. In the UK, however, it has not yet been possible to develop such a service for the whole population. This is becausein the UK, General Practice is managed by Primary Care Trusts, while Secondary Care, including Psychiatry, is managed by Mental Health Trusts. This has led the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, and indeed local commissioners of care to focus on a Stepped Model for the treatment of depression, with one key issue being access (or referral) to secondary care, and discharge back to primary care, with a group of Mental Health workers focussing on the facilitation (or gate-keeping) of these processes, rather than focussing on actually optimising outcomes of care.\nthe evidence argues for the development of collaborative care between primary and secondary care for the treatment of Depression. This will require common medication guidelines across both Primary and Secondary Care, easy access so that General Practitioners can receive advice from Psychiatrists about patients, and the use of Mental Health Professionals to provide patients with psycho-education, support of concordance with treatment, and psychotherapy. It may be that, in order for this to be achieved, services may need to be re-structured, to allow easy communication between professionals."}, {"Title": "The effects of behavioral activation therapy with inpatient geriatric psychiatry patients.", "Abstract": "This study examined the effects of Behavioral Activation (BA) treatment on depressive symptoms and quality of life among older adult patients in a geriatric psychiatry facility.

In the field of psychiatry, there has been a trend of shortened psychiatric hospitalizations which some have suggested may be due to pressures related to insurance coverage. In Israel, soldiers have comprehensive medical coverage provided by the military, and this coverage includes full payment for psychiatric hospitalizations. In contrast, Israeli civilians are insured by the government according to a global payment system. In this study, we aimed to examine differences between these two groups in terms of length of stay (LOS) in psychiatric hospitals.\nData on psychiatric admissions of soldiers (aged 18-21) spanning the past 30 years was obtained from the military database (N=2,106). Corresponding data was collected on first psychiatric hospitalizations of a cohort of matched civilians (N=6556). The mean LOS of the two groups was compared.\nCivilians had a significantly longer LOS than soldiers. Moreover, LOS decreased between the seventies and the nineties for both groups, and the decrease was observed for all diagnoses regardless of disease severity.\nWe conclude that in the managed care era, economic considerations may at times take precedence over psychiatric ones, irrespective of the degree of severity of illness. The parallel process is manifested in a general trend towards deinstitutionalization in the United States, Canada and Europe."}, {"Title": "Postgraduate trainees as simulated patients in psychiatric training: Role players and interviewers perceptions.", "Abstract": "Teaching skills to enhance competence in clinical settings need to have a focus on learning how to do.

This exercise is performed in front of consultants and peers who subsequently provide feedback about the content and process using a structured format. In order to assess the subjective experience of the interviewer and the role players they were requested to provide structured feedback on several aspects. The trainee role player provided feedback on comfort in playing the role, need for further inputs, satisfaction regarding role play, satisfaction with the interview, and the overall effect of the activity. The trainee interviewer gave feedback on his/her level of comfort performing in front of a peer group, being watched, and evaluated in a group.\nThe feedback forms from 15 sessions were analyzed. Only two of the role players indicated that they felt very uncomfortable while the rest reported comfort. Twelve of the 15 trainees who simulated patients felt they needed more inputs to improve the clarity of the role play; however they all reported feeling satisfied with the role play or interview. The feedback from the interviewers indicated that most were comfortable in all aspects, i.e. conducting the interview, performing in front of a group, being evaluated, and given feedback in front of a group.\nThe trainees report indicates that those simulating patients need more clarity on their roles and majority had no discomfort performing in front of a group. Interviewers were satisfied and comfortable with all aspects. On the whole, simulated interviews and role plays were found to be an acceptable teaching method by postgraduate psychiatry trainees."}, {"Title": "Pathway of care among psychiatric patients attending a mental health institution in central India.", "Abstract": "Only a limited proportion of patients with psychiatric disorders attend the healthcare facilities, and that too when the condition becomes severe.

The latter will be subsequently divided in two main categories, the bipolar disorder on the one hand and recurrent depression on the other hand, this separation being still current, and extensively diffused by the mean of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The DSM, whose revisions largely determine the evolution of the contemporary nosographic models, mainly relies on a categorical approach of the mental disorders. The next revision will probably continue to follow this kind of approach, even if the use of dimensional components could also be developed. In the future, true nosographic advances can be waited from clinical epidemiology studies, as those which recently made it possible to highlight various sub-types of affective disorders on the basis of clinical, biographical or temperamental characteristics. Etiological approaches, centered on the pathophysiology of the affective disorders, could also contribute to build nosographic models on the basis of an objective knowledge on these diseases."}, {"Title": "[Efficacy of the treatment program for substance use disorder under the Medical Treatment and Supervision Act in Japan].", "Abstract": "In Japan, the Medical Treatment and Supervision Act (MTSA) has been in effect since 2005 as a new system for treating mentally disordered offenders.

Subjects were the 15 inpatients admitting to this ward, who participated in had the TPSUD due to co-occurrence of SUD. A self-reporting questionnaire, which consisted of the Self-Efficacy Scale for Drug Dependence (SESDD), and Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES), and some clinical information, was administered before and after the program. Consequently, the subscale score of the SOCRATES, \"recognition,\" was significantly elevated after the TPSUD in alcohol related problems, while the subscale score of the SESDD, \"global change of self-efficacy for drug dependence,\" was significantly elevated in drug-related problems. Additionally, either rate of the subjects who started to the anti-alcohol drugs or who manifested to participate in self-help groups for SUD was also significantly elevated.

One of the causes of their disappointment is a 'bogus contract' (Smith, 2001) between patients and psychiatrists. Patients tend to idealize modern psychiatry as if it could solve many of their problems, including social ones. Psychiatrists, however, know that modern psychiatry has limited powers and that they cannot solve all problems, especially social ones. There is a huge mismatch between what psychiatrists are trained for and what they are required to do. In fact, the biological model of depression is inadequate to help depressive patients, particularly patients with psycho-social problems. It has long been believed that antidepressant medications represent the best established treatment for major depressive disorder. Recent meta-analyses (Kirsch et al., 2008; Fournier et al., 2010), however, found little evidence that anti-depressants have a specific pharmacological effect relative to a pill placebo for patients with mild or moderate symptoms. This may be owing partly to the fact that depression is associated with ineluctable life events like separation, interpersonal conflicts, unexpected adversities, etc., that are central to being human. Both patients and psychiatrists should be aware of the limitations of psychiatric treatment. A more realistic relationship is required between patients and psychiatrists. Psychiatrists should be open about their limitations. Patients cannot leave social problems to psychiatrists. However, some chronically depressed patients may be capable of managing their social problems. In such cases, respecting patients' autonomy promotes clinical practice and prevents them from entering a state of chronic patienthood."}, {"Title": "Relationship between anger, alcoholism and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorders in war veterans.", "Abstract": "Studies among veterans indicate that veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) express anger, hostility and aggression as well as alcohol and substance abuse more then veterans without PTSD.

Developed in the early 1990s at McMaster University in Canada, EBM captured a simple and compelling principle--that clinical decision-making should be based on the most up to date, rigorously generated research findings. The same principle has been applied in the development of evidence-based psychiatry. However, numerous scholars have pointed out epistemological problems in EBM's concept of evidence and have highlighted ways in which social factors can influence and distort the generation, interpretation and dissemination of EBM-preferred research data. These issues may be more problematic in psychiatry as compared to other medical specialties. Furthermore, as this paper argues, there are other kinds of data excluded by EBM that are essential to psychiatric practice. The validity of these data have been investigated empirically only rarely. In an era in which evidence- based psychiatric practice is becoming synonymous with \"good\" practice, developing a comprehensive understanding of what constitutes evidence in psychiatry -rather than the narrower version allowed by EBM- is an urgent priority. This paper represents an initial effort to develop a defensible, broader version of psychiatric evidence."}, {"Title": "[Possibility and limits of the understanding-horizon of psychiatry].", "Abstract": "A significant approach in present day psychiatry called evidence-based (EBP) resorts to research as well as practice using standardized methods of evaluation of operating symptoms and description of symptoms.

However, the progressive detachment from the concrete, the situational disconnection and disregard of the subject in its facticity leave open gaps in the scientific nature of psychiatry.

Functional connectivity of the OFC, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging with an emotional face-matching task, was measured before and after the trial. Higher OFC connectivity with the left motor areas and the OFC regions prior to the trial characterized responders (p<0.05, false discovery rate). The treatment non-responders were characterized by higher OFC-cerebellum connectivity. The strength of response was positively correlated with functional coupling between left OFC and the caudate nuclei and thalami. Differences in longitudinal changes were detected between venlafaxine and mirtazapine treatment in the motor areas, cerebellum, cingulate gyrus and angular gyrus.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate several validity aspects of the NPD construct.\nThe material consisted of data from 2277 patients (80% of whom had a personality disorder [PD]) who were admitted to units connected to The Norwegian Network of Psychotherapeutic Day Hospitals. The Axis II diagnoses were assessed by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM, Fourth Edition, Axis II Personality Disorders.\nThe frequency of NPD was very low (0.8%). Male patients were overrepresented both on a diagnostic level and on criteria levels. The NPD category was positively associated with other cluster B disorders and negatively associated with avoidant PD. The criteria \"demands excessive admiration\" and \"fantasies of unlimited success\" correlated almost as highly with the histrionic PD category and loaded primarily on a histrionic factor. The dominant NPD factor also included the antisocial criterion of \"showing no regret having injured others.\" The major part of the patients' personality pathology could be attributed to other PD criteria.\nThe results challenge the notion of NPD as a distinct diagnostic category. Rather, narcissism should be conceived as personality dimensions pertinent to the whole range of PDs. The results support the views put forward by Russ et al (Refining the construct of narcissistic personality disorder: diagnostic criteria and subtypes.

Participants performed the task under each of the four drug conditions across four consecutive sessions.\nMethylphenidate led to a reduction in both response time variability and stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), indicating enhanced response inhibition compared with all other drug conditions. Crucially, the enhancement of response inhibition by MPH occurred without concomitant changes in overall response speed, arguing against a simple enhancement of processing speed. We found no significant differences between ATM and PLAC, CIT and PLAC, or ATM and CIT for either response time variability or SSRT.\nAn acute dose of MPH but not ATM or CIT was able to improve SSRT and reduce response time variability in nonclinical participants. Improvements in response inhibition and response variability might underlie the reported clinical benefits of MPH in disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder."}, {"Title": "Prevalence and comorbidities of somatoform disorders in a rural california outpatient psychiatric clinic.", "Abstract": "This study examines the prevalence and comorbidities of somatoform disorders in a rural setting with a diverse ethnic population.\nA retrospective chart review was conducted of active psychiatric outpatients in a clinic located in a rural community. Data abstracted included demographic variables, multi-axial diagnoses (DSM-IV-TR), length of treatment, psychotropic medications, and number of medications discontinued because of side effects. Improvement in level of function with treatment was measured by change in global assessment of functioning (GAF) scores.\nOf 737 records reviewed, 37 (5%) contained a diagnosis of somatoform disorder. The most common comorbidities in the somatoform group were depression (P < .01), hypertension (P < .01), and arthritis (P < .05). The somatoform group was significantly more likely to have a chronic medical illness (P < .01) and history of surgeries (P < .05). The somatoform group patients' \u0394GAF was one fourth the \u0394GAF scores in all other psychiatric outpatients (1.41 vs 6.79, P < .01). The somatoform group changed medications more often because of side effects (1.35 times vs 0.71 times, P < .01), received a greater number of psychotropic medications (2.05 vs 1.62, P < .05), and was more likely to be taking an antidepressant (P < .05) than the nonsomatoform group.\nSomatoform disorder patients had a higher prevalence of depression, chronic medical conditions, and surgeries. They responded less favorably to treatment when compared to patients without a somatoform disorder, and manifested a decreased tolerance to medication side effects. Female gender, fewer years of education, and Latino ethnicity did not increase the probability of having a somatoform disorder."}, {"Title": "Motor examinations in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The capacity for voluntary motor activity underpins all behavior.

The subsequent imposition of the rigid conceptual dichotomy between depression and anxiety strengthened a notion that the focus of psychiatry should be on the 'depression side' of this divide. Having promoted cognitive-behavioural therapy as the best treatment for anxiety disorders, clinical psychologists have largely 'taken over' the anxiety disorders from psychiatrists. It is suggested that psychiatrists' surrender of the anxiety disorders may have negative consequences for the future of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Symptoms of ADHD and depression in a large adolescent population: co-occurring symptoms and associations to experiences of sexual abuse.", "Abstract": "Symptoms of either attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or depression constitute the most common reasons for contact with child and adolescent psychiatry.

The factors associated to the profile type of the patient with relevant physical symptoms were: being a woman, having a background of depression and/or anxiety, anxiety according to the DSM-IV, any concomitant condition in general, and specifically hepatic-digestive and osteoarticular system affectation and, as protective factor, being 70 years of age or older.\nThe PHQ-15 questionnaire in its Spanish version has been shown to be feasible, reliable and valid to evaluate somatic symptoms in patients with depression and/ or anxiety disorders in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Conflict and deficit in etiopathogenia].", "Abstract": "Currently, there is a proliferation of theories and theoretical languages in the field of Mental Health. These different languages, with their accompanying discourse, can be a great source of confusion for the therapist, who is often forced to use them in clinical practice. The purpose of this paper is to describe and compare two principal theories in an attempt to integrate their different theoretical languages and approaches. To this end, two approaches in etiopathogenia, conflict and deficit, characteristic of two principal models, namely the medical-psychiatric model and the psychoanalytic-psychodynamic model, are described and compared. Firstly, deficit and psychic conflict are defined in the context of psychopathology. Secondly, Freud's complemental series is described and suggested as a model to enable the inclusion of both concepts in the etiopathology of mental disease. Thirdly, the diagnostic process is examined to illustrate how each model operates using a different methodology to collect data. In the field of psychiatry, clinical observation involves finding generalities to classify the disease in a nosography. In contrast, psychoanalysis investigates the conflict in the therapeutic relationship, and thus preserves the singularity of the subject. Finally, it is suggested that both models may be necessary and complementary, as they are both instrumental in the treatment of mental illness."}, {"Title": "[The differential diagnosis of hysteria in the ravines of contemporary psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The diagnosis of \"hysteria\" has recently become part of the history of Psychiatry.

Research on the topic of no-show for initial and consecutive appointments in the field of forensic psychiatry is scarce. This study therefore aims to determine the prevalence and causes of no-show and to explore reasons for nonattendance. The study was carried out in an outpatient clinic in northern Netherlands. Telephone interviews were administered to 27 no-show clients, 84 follow-up no-show clients, and 41 attendees of 18 years and older. A no-show rate of 24.9% and a follow-up no-show rate of 9.8% was found. The majority of appointments missed were in the beginning phase of clinic contact. No-show clients were younger than their attending counterparts and more often dropped out from clinic contact. Also, less family social support was experienced by nonattendees.

The cost of untreated mental illness in the United States is estimated to be >$100 billion annually and nearly half of that cost can be attributed to persons age \u226560. In this paper we present a comprehensive review of empiric data available on primary prevention for the most common psychiatric illnesses in this patient population.\nWe did an English language literature review of published studies and selected only those with the strongest emphasis on primary prevention for the most common psychiatric illnesses in older adults.\nModifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors and several primary prevention strategies have been described, several of them with positive outcomes mainly for depressive disorders and suicide. In conditions such as bipolar disorder, dementias, and geriatric schizophrenia, there is either a paucity of studies or no robust primary prevention strategies identified.\nModification of risk factors, a healthy lifestyle that includes a healthy diet, exercise, socialization, and education are important aspects of primary prevention in elderly patients.

It includes promotion of mental health, identification of risk factors across the life cycle, and appropriate early interventions. Recent emphasis on intervention early in the development of mental illness has resulted in several preventive programs with varying degrees of success.\nWe reviewed the literature on primary prevention in mental health, categorizing reports as evidence of universal, selective, or indicated prevention.\nIndicated prevention through early intervention is the best-researched area of prevention in the spectrum of psychotic disorders, especially schizophrenia. Pharmacotherapy for ultra high-risk individuals combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown promising results in several studies. Strategies that teach younger individuals to cope with stress and provide psychosocial support have been effective in preventing mood and anxiety disorders.\nThere is evidence that primary prevention may delay the onset of mental illness. Future research on the etiologies of mental illnesses is required to facilitate development of additional primary prevention strategies. These efforts may contribute to reallocation of resources and enactment of public policies that curb the staggering effects of mental illness on society."}, {"Title": "Relevance of psychiatry in dermatology: Present concepts.", "Abstract": "Skin is an organ that has a primary function in tactile receptivity and reacts directly upon emotional stimuli. Dermatological practice involves a psychosomatic dimension. A relationship between psychological factors and skin diseases has long been hypothesized.

This article reviews different dermatological conditions under each of the three categories namely psychosomatic disorders, dermatological conditions due to primary and secondary psychiatric disorders. Dermatological conditions resulting from psychiatric conditions like stress/depression and those caused by psychiatric disorders are discussed. This review intends to present the relationship between the 'skin' and the 'mind' specifically from the dermatology point of view.

In recent years, there has been a particular focus on medical care for cancer patients provided by palliative care teams. This type of medical care has the following two characteristics from the perspective of the organizational theory of CPL. One is that this type of medical care has elements of both medical care of a consultation model and medical care of a liaison model. The other is that dual team medicine combining team medicine within a palliative care team and team medicine between the palliative care team and a primary doctor and floor nurses is performed. Such an understanding is important in order to enrich medical care provided by palliative care teams in the future. Moreover, in clinical CLP, there are some characteristics that are frequently and specifically observed in cancer patients. Among those, patients may have a feeling of helplessness due to the absence of effective self-care and limitations on the ability of the patients to act by themselves. An empowerment approach is effective for this, and we have described the actual methods for carrying out such an approach."}, {"Title": "Toward an osteopathic psychiatry: the biocognitive model of mind.", "Abstract": "Osteopathic medicine represents a valid tradition in Western medicine, but there are concerns about whether it is a viable tradition: will it end up a \"poorer cousin\" of the allopathic tradition or will it eventually simply be absorbed by the dominant model? This is particularly the case in psychiatry, where osteopathic medicine has never established a firm presence. Currently, the dominant ethos in psychiatry is reductive biologism, which tries to eliminate the notion of mind as a causative factor in behavior. The author's case is that this has failed to give rise to a human-centered psychiatry. His own model of mental disorder, the biocognitive model, is based on a molecular resolution of the mind-body problem (ie, the ancient question of how the immaterial mind and the material body interact). It is manifestly dualist (ie, it accords causative primacy to mind). This is firmly in the osteopathic medical tradition and is offered as a means of developing a distinctive model of psychiatry and hence a holistic general medicine."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents presenting with unexplained chronic pain: what is the prevalence and clinical relevancy?", "Abstract": "The prevalence of psychiatric disorders among children with unexplained chronic pain (UCP) is high in unselected populations and pain clinics, yet the clinical relevance of these disorders in children referred for unexplained pain is not known. This study assessed the prevalence of clinically relevant psychiatric disorders and their predictors in children referred to a children's hospital for UCP. Psychiatry morbidity was assessed in 134 children, aged 8-17 years, using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-parent version (DISC-P) and the Semi-structured Clinical Interview for Children and Adolescents (SCICA). Clinical relevance was determined using a maladjustment criterion of 61 or lower on the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). Pain parameters were measured with standardized questionnaires. Results were analysed by logistic regression. According to the DISC-P, 21% of the children had clinically relevant psychiatric disorders, predominantly anxiety disorders (18%). According to the SCICA, 28% of the children had clinically relevant psychiatric disorders, consisting of anxiety, affective, and disruptive disorders (12, 19, and 9%, respectively). Headache (compared to musculoskeletal pain) was an independent clinical predictor of psychiatric morbidity (OR = 3.10; 95% CI 1.07-8.92, p = 0.04/adjusted OR 2.99; 95% CI 1.02-8.74, p = 0.04). In conclusion, clinically relevant psychiatric disorders are common among children and adolescents referred for UCP.

Therefore, there is a need to study and evaluate effects of certain conditions for anti-aging of the brain. Nutrient supplementation can modify the brain function. The chemistry and function of both the developing and the mature brain are influenced by diet (Fernstrom, Am J Clinical Nutrition 71:1669S-1673S, 2000). Clinical, biochemical, and pathological aspects have shown a correlation between mental symptoms, especially depression and cognitive decline, with high incidence of folate deficiency (Bottiglieri et al., J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 69:562, 2000). In the present study, consequences of folic acid supplementation on brain dysfunction as a result of aging were studied in cerebral cortex, mid brain, and cerebellar regions of rat brain. This study was carried out on 6-, 11-, and 16-month-old rats, which received folic acid at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight/day for a period of 8 weeks. Respective control groups of the same age groups were also taken. At the end of the treatment duration, behavioral studies were performed and later the animals were killed for various biochemical and histological investigations. Results indicated significant improvement in memory as assessed by active avoidance, passive avoidance, and plus maze tests in the folic acid supplemented aged animals. Significant improvement was also seen in the cellular protective mechanisms where by the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes increased in folic acid supplemented group and so was the glutathione content. Increased lipid peroxidation content, a marker of aging, was also found to be decreased during folic acid supplementation in all the three regions of brain in our study. Thus, it can be concluded that folic acid helps in improving the memory status by reducing oxidative stress and maintaining the integrity of neurons during aging."}, {"Title": "First episode psychosis and treatment delay--causes and consequences.", "Abstract": "According to the clinical perspective, early diagnosis of the prodromal phase and early treatment provision in the first episode of psychosis (FEP) is able to prevent or reduce morbidity.

The question that arises is which theory is to be used to explain the issue. In the interpretation of phenomena in psychiatry, Kecmanovi\u0107 discusses possibilities of different approaches (biological, psychological, social and biopsychosocial models) and concludes that none of them provide a complete solution as to how to approach different disorders. The question, therefore, is how to proceed? Although according to Kecmanovi\u0107, the biopsychosocial model, as Engel has formulated it, \"provides only ingredients not a prescription\", it is our opinion that it indeed does not need to provide prescriptions- it is sufficient if it indicates the necessary ingredients. The prescription itself is to be found in novel scientific disciplines, in particular neuropsychology and epigenetics. Gilbert, on the other hand, points out that the bio- psychosocial approach is holistic, and more than that. \"The bio psychosocial approach addresses the complexity of interactions between different domains of functioning and argues that it is the interaction of domains that illuminates important processes\" e.g. a hierarchical dimension of the model as one and development as another dimension provide the basis for a comprehensive perspective on psychiatric disorders, in this case of AD/HD as a risk factor for conduct disorder."}, {"Title": "Critical review of studies on quality of life in psychiatric patients published in Serbian medical journals from 2000 to 2009.", "Abstract": "Quality of life (QoL) is known to be indicative of the level of social functioning in mental health patients.

It seems nowadays that effects of psychotherapy could be monitored and measured by state-of-the art brain imaging techniques. Today, the psychotherapy is considered as a strategic and purposeful environmental influence intended to enhance learning. Since gene expression is regulated by environmental influences throughout life and these processes create brain architecture and influence the strength of synaptic connections, psychotherapy (as a kind of learning) should be explored in the context of aforementioned paradigm. In other words, when placing a client on the couch, therapist actually placed client's neuronal network; while listening and talking, expressing and analyzing, experiencing transference and counter transference, therapist tends to stabilize synaptic connections and influence dendritic growth by regulating gene-transcriptional activity. Therefore, we strongly believe that, in the near future, an increasing knowledge on cellular and molecular interactions and mechanisms of action of different psycho- and pharmaco-therapeutic procedures will enable us to tailor a sophisticated therapeutic approach toward a person, by combining major therapeutic strategies in psychiatry on the basis of rational goals and evidence-based therapeutic expectations."}, {"Title": "National survey carried out by the Mexican Society of Transplantation in 2009 regarding deceased-donor kidney allocation.", "Abstract": "The Mexican Health Law stipulated that the criteria to be taken into account for deceased donor kidney allocation should include the following: \"seriousness of recipient's condition, opportunity of transplant, expected benefits, compatibility with recipient, and all other accepted medical criteria.\" The practical application of these criteria has been perceived by several members of transplantation committees as allowing inequity in kidney allocation.

As a compromise, Australian psychogeriatricians often prescribe moderate dose (three times the threshold) treatment. However, older patients' thresholds sometimes rise steeply as treatment progresses. If energy levels are kept low to make treatment safer, the result might be that patients' recovery is delayed. We report here on changes in prescribed energy over a course of six unilateral treatments.\nA retrospective review of data collected routinely on 42 depressed patients aged \u2265 65 years given moderate dose unilateral ECT in five aged psychiatry services in Victoria, Australia.\nPrescribed energy rose with time, but only 31% of patients reached high dose levels by their sixth treatment.\nWe cannot comment on the safety or effectiveness of moderate dose ECT. We focus instead just on changes in prescribed energy levels. These did not rise quickly in most cases, suggesting that moderate dose ECT cannot be dismissed as a treatment option simply because of the rate of change in electrical stimulation."}, {"Title": "Learning to collaborate: the teaching legacy of Howard Zonana in forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The teaching legacy of Howard Zonana in forensic psychiatry has been in educating psychiatric fellows and law students to collaborate in advocacy on behalf of individuals whose problems exist at the intersection of the law and mental health. The author describes more than three decades of collaborative teaching with Dr. Zonana in Yale Law School legal clinics serving mental hospital patients, prisoners, children, and immigrants. In those clinics, law students and forensic psychiatry fellows have worked collaboratively in representing clinic clients and advocating for their legal and medical rights. The article reports three examples of this interdisciplinary collaboration: a project conducted at a state hospital shortly after the Supreme Court's decision in O'Connor v. Donaldson; a class action on behalf of individuals with developmental disabilities inappropriately subjected to long-term confinement in a state hospital; and an asylum case on behalf of a severely traumatized African woman fleeing persecution in her home country. The author concludes that Dr. Zonana's legacy reflects not only his contributions to medical and legal education, but also his profound commitment to effective and humane medical practice and to justice."}, {"Title": "Commentary: the dynamic evolution of forensic psychiatry at Yale and the Zonanian sphere of influence.", "Abstract": "Forensic psychiatry at Yale begins, develops, and endures through the life and work of Howard Zonana.

As forensic psychiatrists, you are the voice of psychiatry in the law and the interpreter of law to your colleagues in psychiatry. I offer provisional impressions of your collective accomplishments under three themes: expertise, influence, and integrity. First, you have established and nurtured the expertise and authority of forensic psychiatry, which has become increasingly evidence-based and reflects a prudent sense of humility. Second, you have had a significant influence on the design and daily application of mental health law in both criminal and civil spheres. Through the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law (AAPL) and relevant components of the American Psychological Association, you have been a strong and effective advocate for protecting both the needs and rights of people with mental illness and have had demonstrable influence in the Supreme Court as well as at the grassroots. Finally, you have nurtured and protected the ethical integrity of the profession in the face of ever-increasing challenges, due in no small measure to the habits of ethical reflection that Howard Zonana has modeled and taught over the course of his extraordinary career."}, {"Title": "Howard Zonana and the subspecialty maturation of forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The formal process of specialization and subspecialization in medicine began at the start of the 20th century. Although forensic psychiatry has long held a central place within organized psychiatry, it was not officially recognized as a subspecialty until the end of the 20th century. This milestone was achieved through the efforts of many leaders in the field, and prominent among them has been Howard Zonana, MD. His contributions as a clinician, scholar, leader, and mentor over the past several decades have helped advance the maturation of forensic psychiatry and pave the way for its accreditation as a subspecialty.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the question arose of what role, if any, was proper for psychiatrists to play with regard to evaluations of competence to be executed and treatment of incompetent prisoners. Dr. Zonana was a major force in developing the American Psychiatric Association's position, in which the rights of prisoners were balanced with protection of the integrity of the medical profession. He was then deeply involved in helping to persuade the American Medical Association to reject a more extreme position and to adopt this approach. Similarly, in the mid-2000s, Dr. Zonana brought to the attention of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) the participation of psychiatrists in interrogation of detainees in national security settings. The policy that he subsequently helped to craft was adopted by APA and influenced the subsequent, very similar AMA policy. These two examples, of the many that could have been chosen, illustrate the profound impact that Howard Zonana has had on the ethics of psychiatry as a whole and on the ethics of forensic psychiatry in particular."}, {"Title": "Commentary: the problem of agreement on diagnoses in criminal cases.", "Abstract": "The authors present an important two-part study as they strive to provide an empirical analysis of psychiatric diagnoses in criminal case reports in Australia. In the first part, they compare the level of agreement or correlation of diagnoses between pairs of experts who prepared reports for either the prosecution or defense with other reports prepared for the same and opposing sides and by profession (i.e., psychiatrists and/or psychologists). In the second part, they compare the level of agreement or correlation between experts retained by either the prosecution or defense and treating practitioners. Psychiatric diagnoses are fundamental requirements that may affect the adjudication of criminal and civil cases. Both parts of the study focus on criminal cases and are very exciting in that they review not only the correlation of agreements in these areas but also address indirectly the concept of the so-called hired gun. The development of specialized expertise in the evaluation and assessment of defendants by designated opinion or expert witnesses has progressed over time. The nexus between psychiatry and the law (i.e., forensic psychiatry) has included the presentation of psychiatric diagnosis to the courts and the necessity for the expert or treating practitioner to address legal questions raised by the court. This study makes important steps in the direction of examining and analyzing the role of psychiatric diagnosis according to the responsibilities of the evaluator (i.e., as independent examiner or treating practitioner), as well as the possible influence of professional training and experience on differences in diagnoses between two evaluators. It is anticipated that there will be further work in these areas to address not only diagnoses but forensic recommendations and opinions."}, {"Title": "Commentary: sildenafil in phallometric testing--an evidence-based assessment of sexual offenders.", "Abstract": "The field of medicine has moved toward best practices based on evidence. There is pressure on all medical disciplines, including forensic psychiatry, to adopt this approach. Some areas of forensic psychiatry have a stronger scientific basis that clearly fits the definition of evidence-based medicine than do other areas. One of these areas is the assessment and treatment of sexual offenders, which has a strong scientific basis and meets the definition of evidence-based medicine, as defined by Sackett et al. in 2007.

At the same time, the federal government has been placing in detention more individuals who are here illegally. The number of immigration cases awaiting resolution has surpassed 200,000. The absence of a clear U.S. immigration policy contributes to this development. The conflicts in Iran and Afghanistan have resulted in an increase in the number of individuals seeking asylum. Psychiatric evaluations and psychological testing that provide organized life histories coupled with diagnostic evaluations of the effects of past trauma are relevant to the criteria needed for refugee status. Courts have found them useful, and attorneys and clinics are requesting them. Several forensic training programs have set up consultation agreements with these programs and are finding them to be excellent training experiences for fellows who can help not only with the formal evaluations but also in educating law students in relation to their interviewing techniques and boundary problems that arise in a professional relationship."}, {"Title": "Commentary: so the pendulum swings--making sense of the duty to protect.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry has been struggling for nearly 40 years to make sense of the duty to protect. The great jurisdictional disparity as to what constitutes the duty has been a significant contributing factor. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) released the Model Statute in 1987 to establish a framework to guide legislators and courts toward consensus, to some effect. In response to case law and statutory requirements in most states, psychiatric practice has incorporated the assessment of risk to third parties by patients as an essential element of psychiatric assessment and care. Although court cases shortly after the Tarasoff decision expanded the scope and breadth of the duty to protect, in recent years there appears to have been a shift toward a more narrow interpretation as to what conditions must exist to find a defendant psychiatrist guilty of failing to exercise the duty properly. The threshold for the duty to warn or protect often rests precariously beside the criteria permitting an exception to confidentiality, placing the psychiatrist in a tenuous position. If appellate verdicts continue to find for the defendant psychiatrist in cases claiming a breach of the duty to protect, it could have an impact on how psychiatrists assess and manage threats made by patients toward third parties."}, {"Title": "Time-lag bias in trials of pediatric antidepressants: a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "To determine whether there is evidence of a time-lag bias in the publication of pediatric antidepressant trials.\nWe conducted a meta-analysis of published and unpublished randomized placebo-controlled trials of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in subjects less than 18 years of age with major depressive disorder. Our main outcomes were (1) time to publication of positive versus negative trials, and (2) proportion of treatment responders in trials with standard (<3 years after study completion) versus delayed publication.\nWe identified 15 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of SRIs for pediatric depression. Trials with negative findings had a significantly longer time to publication (median years \u00b1 standard deviation = 4.2 \u00b1 1.9) than trials with positive findings (2.2 \u00b1 0.9; log-rank \u03c7(2) = 4.35, p = .037).

Modular networks allow for flexibility within the modular processing units and across interconnected modules affording optimization of task performance and deficit compensation in disease. As an example it will be shown that differentiated modules in medial frontal cortex play a critical role for the control of behaviour.

A survey of five residency programs.", "Abstract": "In the face of fewer psychiatrist applicants for psychoanalytic training, determining the interest of current psychiatric residents in psychoanalysis and psychodynamic psychiatry is a pressing concern. To gauge this interest, an anonymous online survey was sent to residents from five psychiatry residency programs in the Midwest and South. Seventy-five residents responded, for a return rate of 42%. The data suggest that residents value psychoanalytic concepts and most plan to incorporate the practice of psychodynamic psychotherapy into their careers after graduation; however, residents have little confidence in their level of skill and the adequacy of their training. While 46% express interest in further psychodynamic psychotherapy training, only 22% express interest in psychoanalytic training. Most cite the cost and time involved as reasons they would not pursue further training. This study demonstrates that psychiatric residents have strong interest in and respect for psychodynamic psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. The data suggest that psychiatric residents are a viable pool of applicants for psychoanalytic training, especially if barriers to training can be reduced and creative ways for psychoanalysts to engage residents can be fostered."}, {"Title": "Validation of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.", "Abstract": "The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a questionnaire that assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month period.

Between January 2006 and September 2007, the PSQI-BR was applied to a group of consecutive patients who were submitted to overnight polysomnography with clinical suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) or insomnia. As in the original article, a group of patients with depression and a control group were included. The depression group was composed of patients from the Mood Disorders Unit of the Psychiatry Department of Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), Brazil. The control group was composed of subjects with a history of normal sleep habits, without noticed snoring.\nA total of 83 patients and 21 controls completed the questionnaire and were submitted to overnight polysomnography. The seven-component scores of the PSQI-BR had an overall reliability coefficient (Cronbach's \u03b1) of 0.82, indicating a high degree of internal consistency. The groups included 43 patients with OSAS, 21 with insomnia, 19 with depression and 21 controls. The mean (\u00b1SD) PSQI-BR score was 8.1\u00b14.0 for patients with OSAS, 12.8\u00b13.7 for insomnia patients, 14.5\u00b13.7 for those with depression and 2.5\u00b12.0 for control subjects. The one-way ANOVA demonstrated significant differences in PSQI-BR scores across the four diagnostic groups (p<0.001).

PSQI-BR scores for insomnia did not differ from those obtained for depression (p>0.05), but both were higher than for OSAS (p<0.05).\nThe results of the present study demonstrate that the PSQI-BR is a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of sleep quality and equivalent to its original version when applied to individuals who speak the Brazilian Portuguese language. Despite relevant influences of language and cultural background, no major cultural adaptations were necessary during the validation process.

Few families were notified about their relation's seclusion. More hours of seclusion were reported in the evening and at night. Our results are comparable to those obtained by other investigators. Some of the variables have not been the subject of much research: for example, health conditions during seclusion with or without restraint and partnerships with family members. Our findings also suggest that, in their analyses, studies should differentiate between cognitive-impairment and adult-psychiatry units as well as long-term seclusion and short-term seclusion.

Of these, 16% reported abuse in their current relationship, 58% in a previous relationship, and 57% reported a history of childhood abuse. High-risk groups for abuse included females (43%), gay/bisexual males (35%), and Aboriginals (61%). We found an association between a history of domestic violence and delayed access to care (p < 0.05), missed appointments (p < 0.001), and an increased use of clinic resources such as social work (p < 0.0001) and psychiatry (p < 0.001). Mental health conditions prior to HIV diagnosis, including depression (p < 0.0001), suicidal ideation (p < 0.0001), and anxiety disorder (p < 0.0001) were associated with abuse at any time, while a history of adjustment disorder was associated with childhood abuse (p < 0.05). A simple domestic violence screening tool was helpful for identifying patients experiencing abuse in our diverse HIV-infected population.

The latter give rise to polypharmacy which may lead to drug-drug interactions. Assessment of drug interactions is more and more difficult as the total number of drugs taken increases. In the present study hospital discharge medication was analysed semiautomatically for possible drug-drug interactions.\nIn-hospital cases were randomly selected. Discharge medication was analysed using PsiacOnline, a large web-based database for drug interactions.\nThe selection yielded 342 cases from 213 patients (mean age 46.3 years, 53 % females). 86 patients had one psychiatric diagnosis; the other patients had at least two or more diagnoses. The discharge prescription was analysed for 55 different psychotropic drugs from 4 large drug groups (18 antidepressants; 17 antipsychotic drugs; 5 mood stabilisers/epileptic drugs and 13 different hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs). Antipsychotic drugs were the most frequent drugs (n = 334); followed by antidepressants (n = 312) and mood stabilizers (n = 112). 47 patients (13.7 %) were discharged with monotherapy.

However, current classification approaches are mainly based on data from a single biomarker, making it difficult to predict disorders characterized by complex patterns of symptoms.\nTo integrate neuroimaging data associated with multiple symptom-related neural processes and demonstrate their utility in the context of depression by deriving a predictive model of brain activation.\nTwo groups of participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during 3 tasks probing neural processes relevant to depression.\nParticipants were recruited from the local population by use of advertisements; participants with depression were inpatients from the Department of Psychiatry, Psychosomatics, and Psychotherapy at the University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.\nWe matched a sample of 30 medicated, unselected patients with depression by age, sex, smoking status, and handedness with 30 healthy volunteers.\nAccuracy of single-subject classification based on whole-brain patterns of neural responses from all 3 tasks.\nIntegrating data associated with emotional and affective processing substantially increases classification accuracy compared with single classifiers. The predictive model identifies a combination of neural responses to neutral faces, large rewards, and safety cues as nonredundant predictors of depression. Regions of the brain associated with overall classification comprise a complex pattern of areas involved in emotional processing and the analysis of stimulus features.\nOur method of integrating neuroimaging data associated with multiple, symptom-related neural processes can provide a highly accurate algorithm for classification. The integrated biomarker model shows that data associated with both emotional and reward processing are essential for a highly accurate classification of depression.

If we can learn more about the ways in which the stress process unfolds for children, we will gain important insights into the factors that influence initial set points of trajectories of mental health over the life course. This will simultaneously extend the scope of the stress process paradigm and elaborate the life course perspective on mental health. Incorporating children's lives into the sociology of mental health will also extend the intellectual influence of the discipline on sociomedical and biomedical research on mental illness. I contend that sociology's greatest promise in understanding trajectories of mental health across the life course lies in a systematic analysis of the social and social-psychological conditions of children, the stressful experiences that arise out of these conditions, and the processes that mediate and moderate the stress process in childhood. In this regard, there are three major issues that sociologists could begin to address: (1) the identification of structural and institutional factors that pattern children's exposure to stress; (2) the construction of a stress universe for children; and (3) the identification of key elements of the life course perspective that may set or alter trajectories of mental health in childhood and adolescence."}, {"Title": "Mental health concerns among Canadian physicians: results from the 2007-2008 Canadian Physician Health Study.", "Abstract": "In light of prior reports on the prevalence of stress, depression, and other mental health problems among physicians in training and practice, we examined the mental health concerns of Canadian physicians using data from the 2007-2008 Canadian Physician Health Study.\nAmong 3213 respondents, 5 variables (depressive symptoms during the past year, anhedonia in the past year, mental health concerns making it difficult to handle one's workload in the past month, problems with work-life balance, and poor awareness of resources for mental health problems) were examined in relation to sex, specialty, practice type (solo practice vs group or other practice settings), and practice setting (inner city, urban/suburban, or rural/small town/remote).\nNearly one quarter of physicians reported a 2-week period of depressed mood, and depression was more common among female physicians and general practitioners/family physicians.

Descriptive statistics were calculated and odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for having different types of related problems, stratified on clinical settings, using physicians working in internal medicine as reference group.\nSickness-certification consultations were frequent; 67% of all physicians had such, and of those, 83% had that at least once a week. The proportion who had such consultations >5 times a week varied between clinical settings; from 3% in dermatology to 79% in orthopaedics; and was 43% in primary health care. The OR for finding sickness-certification tasks problematic was highest among the physicians working in primary health care (OR 3.3; CI 2.9-3.7) and rheumatology clinics (OR 2.6; CI 1.9-3.5). About 60% found it problematic to assess patients' work capacity and to provide a prognosis regarding the duration of work incapacity.\nSo far, most interventions regarding physicians' sickness-certification practices have been targeted towards primary health care and general practitioners. Our results indicate that the ORs for finding these tasks problematic were highest in primary health care. Nevertheless, physicians in some other clinical settings more often have such consultations and many of them also find these tasks problematic, e.g. in rheumatology, neurology, psychiatry, and orthopaedic clinics. Thus, the results indicate that much can be gained through focusing on physicians in other types of clinics as well, when planning interventions to improve sickness-certification practice."}, {"Title": "[The new hospital reimbursement system: a chance and a challenge to child and adolescent psychiatry or \u00abmuch ado about nothing\u00bb?].", "Abstract": "New legislation in the financing of psychiatric hospitals in Germany stipulates the introduction of a new reimbursement system for psychiatric child and adolescent psychiatric and psychosomatic hospitals in Germany by 2013. In several steps norms are to be empirically defined and services to be documented, and the current per diem system of hospital charges has to be replaced by a more specific system reflecting differences in the level of distinct patient groups. This discussion paper gives an overview of the legal framework as well as the risks and chances of the new system. An increased effort in documentation will be one of the clear consequences of the new system (\u00abmuch ado\u00bb ...). Psychiatric inpatient treatment will be much more transparent in detail, though it is not yet clear whether there will be a real improvement for patients (... \u00ababout nothing\u00bb).

To answer this question, we have to consider professional standards, legal rules, and ethical reflections. With reference to the latter, four bioethical principles were proposed by Beauchamp and Childress to identify and to deal with ethical problems and conflicts. On the basis of this scheme we reflect on the legal aspects and discuss the following topics: (1) self-determination of adolescents concerning their own psychiatric treatment, (2) conflicts between autonomy and care, which occur relatively often, whenever restrictions to personal liberty are indicated, and (3) admission of adolescents in adult psychiatric wards. The bioethical principles facilitate a reliable decision-making process in individual cases. The standards of right and good action have to be implemented in the field of distributive justice. We find evidence that prioritization decisions for inpatient admission are already established in German child and adolescent psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[The significance of functional psychophysiological methods in child and adolescent psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Psychophysiological research focusing on child development and on child and adolescent psychiatric disorders has provided many important insights.

The SCID-I, SCID-II, Multidimensional Anger Scale, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Social Comparison Scale, Boratav Depression Screening Scale, and Beck Hopelessness Scale were administered to consecutive admissions of 50 males and 50 females.\nAxis-I diagnoses were present in 60% of males and 74% of females. Axis-II diagnoses were present in 28% of males and 36% of females. Somatoform disorders and impulse control disorder were higher in males, whereas anxiety disorders and mood disorders were higher in females. Depression was diagnosed in 10% of males and 36% of females. \"Not being taken seriously\" was the most prominent reason for anger among females. The \"Revenge reactions\" score was strongly correlated with the education level of the mother in both genders (in females r=0.472, p=0.001; in males r=-0.396, p=0.006). The best predictor of an axis-I diagnosis in women was the \"anger symptoms\" total score, whereas it was the \"thoughts related to anger\" subscale score in males. On the other hand, the best predictors of an axis-II diagnosis were \"anxious behavior\" in females and \"smoking\" in males.\nAnger is an important component of psychiatric disorders.

In due course, as what often happens with innovations, the concept of dual diagnosis displayed considerable limitations and was progressively replaced by comorbidity. This paper critically reviews the limitations of dual diagnosis and comorbidity and formulates an alternative proposal based on clinimetric methods. In many instances of diagnostic reasoning in psychiatry and in clinical psychology, the process ends with the identification of the disorders and their diagnoses. However, diagnostic end-points, the customary guidance of diagnostic reasoning, should be replaced by the conceptualization of disorders as \"transfer stations,\" which are amenable to longitudinal verification and modification. Indeed, diagnoses might encompass a wide range of manifestations, seriousness, prognosis, and response to treatment that need to be evaluated. A new clinimetric approach which takes advantage of clinimetric methods (including macro-analysis, micro-analysis, staging, and evaluation of subclinical symptoms) is proposed. This approach may allow an accurate analysis of the different problem areas of each patient and their hierarchical organization and may yield important implications for mental health and substance abuse clinics."}, {"Title": "Comparative performance of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 in pregnant and postpartum women seeking psychiatric services.", "Abstract": "Adoption of a standard depression measures across clinics and populations is advantageous for continuity of care and facilitation of research. This study provides information on the comparative utility of a commonly used perinatal-specific depression instrument (the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale-EPDS) with a general depression screener (Patient Health Questionnaire-9-PHQ-9) in a sample of perinatal women seeking psychiatry services within a large health care system. Electronic medical records (which included PHQ-9 and EDPS) were abstracted for a final sample of 81 pregnant and 104 postpartum patients (n=185). Psychometric properties were examined among women who met the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) based on clinician diagnoses, as compared to women without any mood disorder diagnosis. Using commonly recommended cut-off scores, both measures had comparable sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for both pregnant and postpartum women. Comparative AUC for ROC contrasts were not significantly different between the two measures. Thus, this study found few significant differences in the performance of the PHQ-9 and EPDS in detecting clinician-diagnosed MDD in a psychiatry outpatient sample of pregnant and postpartum women."}, {"Title": "Objections to routine clinical outcomes measurement in mental health services: any evidence so far?", "Abstract": "Routine clinical outcomes measurement (RCOM) is gaining importance in mental health services.\nTo examine whether criticisms published in advance of the development of RCOM have been borne out by data now available from such a programme.\nThis was an observational study of routine ratings using HoNOS65+ at inception/admission and again at discharge in an old age psychiatry service from 1997 to 2008. Testable hypotheses were generated from each criticism amenable to empirical examination. Inter-rater reliability estimates were applied to observed differences between scores between community and ward patients using resampling.\nFive thousand one hundred eighty community inceptions and 862 admissions had HoNOS65+ ratings at referral/admission and discharge. We could find no evidence of gaming (artificially worse scores at inception and better at discharge), selection, attrition or detection bias, and ratings were consistent with diagnosis and level of service. Anticipated low levels of inter-rater reliability did not vitiate differences between levels of service.\nAlthough only hypotheses testable from within RCOM data were examined, and only 46% of eligible episodes had complete outcomes data, no evidence of the alleged biases were found.

Specifically, their role in the action of the antipsychotics is debated. Our study has analyzed glial reactivity in rats treated with antipsychotics.\nIn a first ultrastructural study of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, the animals were treated with chlorpromazine for 40 days, and were sacrificed at the end of the treatment, after 20 days of rest without treatment. In another series of studies, with the light microscope and immunohistochemistry we evaluated the immunoreactivity of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in six regions of the central nervous system of rats treated with typical and atypical antipsychotics.\nWith the electron microscope, the animals treated with chlorpromazine showed a significant reduction of the axosomatic synapses on the neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus and an increase of glial presence, as noted by the greater amount of astrocyte processes. The mentioned modifications were reversible, tending to normalize in a group of animals sacrificed 20 days after completion of the treatment. In the immunohistochemical study, the glial reaction was important in the territory of the nucleus accumbens with all the antipsychotics, moderate in the cingulate cortex, although only with atypical antipsychotics, and scarcely significant in the rest of the regions.\nOur results confirm that the glial cells are targets of the antipsychotic action, and this will allow us to better understand the action of these drugs and the role of the glial cells in the normal function of the nervous system and in the mental disease."}, {"Title": "Are psychiatric residents still interested in psychoanalysis?

Application of the US Food and Drug Administration's geriatric labeling rule provided further impetus. Developments in the knowledge about 3 principal classes of medications (antidepressants, antipsychotics, and treatments for Alzheimer's disease) illustrate the trajectory of geriatric psychopharmacology research. Nonetheless, the loss of information about age effects that has resulted from applying age exclusion criteria in studies limited to either younger adults or geriatric patients is regrettable. Antidepressant trials have moved from studying younger and medically well \"geriatric\" samples to focusing on \"older old\" persons and those with significant medical comorbidity including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and dementia. Increased specificity is reflected in studies of relationships between specific neuropsychological deficits, specific brain abnormalities, and antidepressant responsiveness. Clinical trials in older adults have demonstrated that the efficacy of antipsychotic medications continues across the lifespan, but that sensitivity to specific side effects changes in older age, with poor tolerability frequently mitigating the benefits of treatment. Treatments for Alzheimer's disease have fallen within the purview of geriatric psychopharmacology. The research focus is increasingly shifting from treatments to slow the course of cognitive decline to studies of early diagnosis and of interventions designed to prevent the development of deficits in vulnerable individuals. The importance of geriatric psychopharmacology will grow further as the average lifespan increases all over the world."}, {"Title": "Diagnosing autism spectrum disorders in elderly people.", "Abstract": "As autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have largely been neglected in old-age psychiatry, the objective of the present paper is to describe the diagnostic process in elderly patients.\nA systematic review of the literature on ASD in older age was undertaken and illustrated by a case series of three elderly patients first diagnosed with ASD in later life by a tertiary mental health clinic.\nThe search of the literature only yielded three papers on late-life ASD, while the review of the available diagnostic procedures among adults suggests some relevance for screening instruments (Autism Questionnaire), diagnostic instruments (Module 4, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule), and neuropsychological examination to profile impairments. Nonetheless, the case reports clearly showed that taking a thorough history with the patient, corroborated and supplemented by a close relative or caregiver who has known the patient for at least ten years, still remains the most important diagnostic tool.\nThe three case studies show that in clinical practice ASD can easily be missed in elderly individuals presenting with comorbid psychiatric disorders, potentially causing iatrogenic damage. Although further research on phenotyping and diagnosing ASD in older people is warranted, the most important step at this point is to create a greater awareness of the possibility of ASD in old age among health-care professionals working with people in this age group."}, {"Title": "Living in squalor: neuropsychological function, emotional processing and squalor perception in patients found living in squalor.", "Abstract": "Patients living in squalor have a wide range of psychiatric diagnoses, but these may have a common neural basis involving frontal systems.

Throughout this history, DSM architects have struggled with the seemingly fundamental, but complex question of how to define a mental disorder. Current proposals indicate that a spectrum model of mental illness will be embraced in DSM-5, prompting renewed concern and debate about pathologizing normal existence. While a spectrum view of mental illness may reflect biologic reality and help pave the path towards validated models of psychiatric disorder, diagnostic expansion does have important practical implications and could give rise to problems in clinical work and society at large, including the further sanctioning of a shift from psychiatric treatment to neuroenhancement. Debates about what should or should not be considered a mental illness in DSM-5 are likely to remain unresolved and, in the future, must be framed according to contextual utility.

This is especially the case in psychiatry when we usually have no direct method of measuring the pathology underlying the disorder being studied but, rather, have to rely on the subjective assessment of psychiatric symptoms. The use of the electroencephalogram (EEG) offers two potential major means of addressing this problem. First it is able to provide direct data relating to neural activity that may be abnormal in certain disorders. As such there are opportunities for utilizing the EEG in a variety of ways as an objective outcome measure. Second there is growing evidence that in certain circumstances the EEG can be used to predict which patients are likely to respond to treatment, thus potentially increasing the power of studies by decreasing non-response rates and increasing mean changes in outcome measure. Both of these uses of the EEG are illustrated in reference to the study of mood disorders and in particular depression and its treatment with antidepressants."}, {"Title": "Prisoners v.

We review the development of the hierarchy of security in the British psychiatric services, beginning in the early 1970s with the establishment of the Butler Committee that determined a hierarchy of three levels of security for the treatment of patients, culminating with the establishment of principles for the operation of medium security units in Britain (Read Committee, 1991). These developments were the basis for the forensic psychiatric services in Britain. We discuss the relevance of the British experience to the situation in Israel while examining the current status of mental health facilities in Israel. In our opinion, a safe and suitable environment is a necessary condition for a treatment setting. The establishment of medium security units or forensic psychiatry departments within a mental health facility will enable the concentration and classification of court-ordered admissions and will enable systemic flexibility and capacity for better treatment, commensurate with patient needs."}, {"Title": "Gender and risk of depression in Saudi Arabia, a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Depression is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. In the year 2000 depression accounted for 4.4% of the global disability adjusted life years (DALYs). The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has a population of 28 million people and is one of the countries experiencing demographic transition in its population structure. Improvements in socioeconomic status have been shown to be associated with increased chronic diseases including chronic mental diseases like depression, but still there is no comprehensive review summarizing the various reports currently existing in the literature. Although individual studies within Saudi Arabia have reported prevalence rates and risks, the quality of such studies need to be subjected to rigorous assessment and their findings pooled to give combined weighted evidence that will provide basis for targeted intervention. Pooled risks have the advantage of adjusting inherent variations within sampled populations and therefore providing more reliable estimates even though there are concerns about possible magnification of smaller individual risks."}, {"Title": "A positive association between homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance score and the Trp64Arg polymorphism of the \u03b23-Adrenergic receptor gene in schizophrenia patients in Taiwan.", "Abstract": "To investigate the possible association between the Trp64Arg polymorphism of the \u03b23-adrenergic receptor gene and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index in schizophrenia patients in Taiwan.\nA total of 203 inpatients who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were recruited from a psychiatry center in Taiwan from September 2002 to August 2003.

Few studies, however, have investigated the relationship between indices of brain structure and treatment response in the context of a controlled clinical trial. In this study, we sought to identify magnetic resonance (MR) imaging measures of the brain that predict treatment response in patients experiencing a first-episode of schizophrenia. Structural MR imaging scans were acquired in 39 patients experiencing a first-episode of schizophrenia with minimal or no prior exposure to antipsychotics participating in a double-blind 16-week clinical trial comparing the efficacy of risperidone vs olanzapine. Twenty-five patients were classified as responders by meeting operationally defined treatment response criteria on 2 consecutive study visits. Fourteen patients never responded to antipsychotic medication at any point during the clinical trial. MR imaging scans were also acquired in 45 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Cortical pattern matching methods were used to compare cortical thickness and asymmetry measures among groups. Statistical mapping results, confirmed by permutation testing, indicated that responders had greater cortical thickness in occipital regions and greater frontal cortical asymmetry compared with nonresponders. Moreover, among responders, greater thickness in temporal regions was associated with less time to respond. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that plasticity and cortical thickness may be more preserved in responders and that MR imaging may assist in the prediction of antipsychotic drug response in patients experiencing a first-episode of schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Depressive episodes with suicide attempts in severe depression: suicides and controls differ only in the later episodes of unipolar depression.", "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the distribution of suicide attempts across the depressive episodes in suicides and controls with a severe depression. A blind record evaluation was performed of 100 suicide victims and matched controls admitted to the Department of Psychiatry between 1956 and 1969 and monitored to 2006. There was a similar number of episodes in suicides and controls and in the early episodes a similar number of suicide attempts in both groups. However, in the later episodes future suicides showed more suicide attempts as compared to controls. This was found for unipolar depression only. This difference was found despite previously shown similar rates of adequate treatment and improvement.

They responded to their delinquent youths through the creation of juvenile courts. This early American juvenile justice system sought to treat children as different from adults and to rehabilitate wayward youths through the state's assumption of a parental role. Although these rehabilitative goals were never fully realized, the field of American child psychiatry was spawned from these efforts on behalf of delinquent youths. Early child psychiatrists began by caring for juvenile offenders. The function of a child psychiatrist with juvenile delinquents expanded beyond strictly rehabilitation, however, as juvenile courts evolved to resemble criminal adult courts-due to landmark Supreme Court decisions and also juvenile legislation between 1966 and 1975. In response to dramatically increased juvenile violence and delinquency rates in the 1980s, juvenile justice became more retributional, and society was forced to confront issues such as capital punishment for juveniles, their transfer to adult courts, and their competency to stand trial. In the modern juvenile court, child psychiatrists are often asked to participate in the consideration of such issues because of their expertise in development. In that context we review the role of psychiatrists in assisting juvenile courts."}, {"Title": "Locked doors: a survey of patients, staff and visitors.", "Abstract": "\u2022 Locking of psychiatric wards doors is more frequent, but the impact is unknown. \u2022 Staff patients and visitors returned a questionnaire about the issue. \u2022 Patients did not like the door being locked as much as staff, and being on a locked ward was associated with greater rejection of the practice. \u2022 Staff working on locked wards were more positive about it than those who did not.\nLocking the door of adult acute psychiatric wards has become increasingly common in the UK. There has been little investigation of its efficacy or acceptability in comparison to other containment methods.

Wards that previously participated in a previous study were contacted and sent a questionnaire. A total of 1227 responses were obtained, with the highest number coming from staff, and the smallest from visitors. Analysis identified five factors (adverse effects, staff benefits, patient safety benefits, patient comforts and cold milieu). Patients were more negative about door locking than the staff, and more likely to express such negative judgments if they were residing in a locked ward. For staff, being on a locked ward was associated with more positive judgments about the practice. There were significant age, gender and ethnicity effects for staff only. Each group saw the issue of locked doors from their own perspective. Patients registered more anger, irritation and depression as a consequence of locked doors than staff or visitors thought they experienced. These differences were accentuated by the actual experience of the ward being locked."}, {"Title": "[Treating drug dependent patients through outpatient group therapy-Serigaya Methamphetamine Relapse Prevention Program (SMARPP)].", "Abstract": "Drug addiction in Japan is a field of clinical psychiatry that occasionally poses questions concerning legal status of the patients abusing illicit drugs.

Among the patients who took the indirect pathway 44% first visited the Individual Private practitioners (PP), 22% first visited native or religious healers (NRH) and 12% rural medical practitioners (RMP). Patients reaching NRH or RMP made the least delay (2-2.5\u00a0weeks) and the shortest pathway to MHP (4.5-7\u00a0weeks). Most delay occurred from PP to MHP/General Hospital (22-31\u00a0weeks). About a third of patients were informed of diagnosis with poor concordance with the diagnosis made by MHP. 70 and 40% of patients with mental illness who attended General Hospital and PP were referred to MHP, respectively.\nIn the study we found four major pathways to mental health care in Bangladesh.

This diagnostic model articulates science and humanism to obtain a diagnosis of the person (of the totality of the person's health, both ill and positive aspects), by the person (with clinicians extending themselves as full human beings), for the person (assisting the fulfillment of the person's health aspirations and life project), and with the person (in respectful and empowering relationship with the person who consults). This broader and deeper notion of diagnosis goes beyond the more restricted concepts of nosological and differential diagnoses. The proposed PID model is defined by 3 keys: broad informational domains, covering both ill health and positive health along 3 levels: health status, experience of health, and contributors to health; pluralistic descriptive procedures (categories, dimensions and narratives); and evaluative partnerships among clinicians, patients, and families. An unfolding research program is focused on the construction of a practical guide and its evaluation, followed by efforts to facilitate clinical implementation and training.\nPID is aimed at appraising overall health through pluralistic descriptions and evaluative partnerships, and leading through a research program to more effective, integrative, and person-centred health care."}, {"Title": "Handedness, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and bulimic disorders.", "Abstract": "Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) research in psychiatry mostly excludes left-handed participants.

The most frequent concern was infection of family and friends and the health consequences of the disease (54.9%). The perceived risk of being infected was considered moderately high (median 6/9). Few HCWs (6.6%) had restricted their social contacts and fewer (3.8%) felt isolated by their family members and friends because of their hospital work, while a low percentage (4.3%) indented to take a leave to avoid infection. However, worry and degree of worry were significantly associated with intended absenteeism (p < 0.0005), restriction of social contacts (p < 0.0005), and psychological distress (p = 0.036). Perceived sufficiency of information about several aspects of the A/H1N1 influenza was moderately high, and the overall information about the A/H1N1 influenza was considered clear (median 7.4/9). Also, perceived sufficiency of information for the prognosis of the infection was significantly independently associated with the degree of worry about the pandemic (p = 0.008).\nA significant proportion of HCWs experienced moderately high anxiety about the pandemic, and their degree of worry was an independent correlate of psychological distress. Since perceived sufficiency of information about the A/H1N1 influenza prognosis was associated with reduced degree of worry, hospital managers and consultation-liaison psychiatry services should try to provide for HCWs' need for information, in order to offer favourable working conditions in times of extreme distress, such as the current and future pandemics."}, {"Title": "Physician professionalism and changes in physician-industry relationships from 2004 to 2009.", "Abstract": "One tenet of medical professionalism is managing conflicts of interest related to physician-industry relationships (PIRs).

One of the potential benefits of including this diagnosis in DSM-5 is to identify persons at high risk of developing psychotic disorders to prevent the appearance of these disorders or lead to disorders with a better prognosis. One of the challenges applying the criteria proposed to the pediatric population is the difficulty in defining \"attenuated\" in the same way and it is done with adults. The threshold for psychosis may be lower in children and, therefore, what is attenuated in adults may be fully present, although transient, in paediatric population.

Characterized by boundaries that define the objectivity of scientific method, the biological stratum or the area of concern (disease and the disembodied being) and the professional distance that is maintained in the healthcare encounter, the noble morality of contemporary allopathic (Western) mental health care practice appears to be being challenged, in an act of ressentiment, by the slave morality of society, inverting values and beliefs that have previously been held. Mental health care paternalism may be in the process of giving way to consumer sovereignty, patient participation in decision making and the re-discovery of the embodied being at the centre of the healthcare encounter. Nietzsche warns that the dominance of slave morality and the inversion of moral values (what was a quality that was held by the nobles and regarded as good) - that is, objectivity and mental health care paternalism - becomes bad; and what was a quality held by the slaves and regarded as bad - subjectivity - becomes good, may ultimately be detrimental to the advancement of society."}, {"Title": "Inpatient dermatological consultations in a university hospital.", "Abstract": "Dermatology is primarily an outpatient specialty, but it also plays an important role in the care of inpatients.\nWe conducted a prospective study that recorded data from inpatient dermatology consultation request forms over a period of four months.

Significant insights come from psychological disciplines, including cognitive, developmental, and neuropsychology, as well as from medical specialties, such as geriatrics, neurology, psychiatry, neuroradiology, and neuropathology, that contribute to the growing interdisciplinary scientific field: cognitive neuroscience of aging. This survey of longitudinal studies of aging suggests that disease-oriented investigations commonly do not adequately consider normative cognitive changes, whereas developmental studies do not sufficiently measure and model nonnormative cognitive aging. This article argues for an integrative perspective that considers both of these influences on cognitive trajectories and presents a series of methodological concerns that have not been addressed comprehensively.

The diagnostic assessment of dyslexia consists of a battery of standardized reading and spelling tests and an evaluation of the child's psychological state, including additional information obtained from parents and teachers. The treatment of dyslexia is based on two main strategies: specific assistance with the impaired learning areas (reading and spelling) and psychotherapy for any coexisting psychological disturbance that may be present. Evaluated preventive strategies are available for use in kindergarten and at home.\nThe diagnosis of dyslexia should be established with the aid of the multiaxial classification system.

Scientific presuppositions about the BPS model have been grounded firmly in psychobiological, psycho-behavioural, sociobiological, and socio-behavioural processes. According to the allostatic load model, stressful factors can be psychological ones or any other factor that is able to modify the stress-response system; these might include genetic factors or life experiences. Personality profiles, in particular, seem to be predictive of responses to different stressors. Stress responses preceding or following illness are clearly related, from a psychobiological point of view, to different personality traits, which themselves correlate to specific defence mechanisms. Neural processes underlying these mechanisms interact with the biological substrate of somatic illnesses. Recent advances in brain imaging with regard to neurobiological and behavioural interactions of empathy and alexithymia support the crucial role of the (psycho) therapeutic relationship across the whole of medical practice. Psychotherapies operate as biological factors on mind, brain, and body; indeed it is necessary to reconsider the doctor-patient relationship as a psychotherapeutic process. The basic methodological triad of observation (outer viewing), introspection (inner viewing), and dialogue (inter viewing) becomes essential in medical practice and in scientific research. Psychoanalytic processes such as transference, resistance, the therapeutic alliance, and attachment have been reconsidered from a neuroscientific perspective and reconceived as moments of meeting of the procedural memory and are therefore considered relevant to the relationship with patients in primary care. Indeed, they are useful to an ethical approach to understanding the meaning of illness, and they also influence the results of treatment projects. Because all these aspects impact upon illness duration and quality of life, affecting both the individual concerned and his or her family, the economic consequences of this psychosomatic approach are important in both general and specialist medicine. Medicine is becoming, and will become even more in the future, an integrated science; human illness and the maintenance of good health may be better understood if all medical disciplines are considered as a whole. The domain of psychosomatic medicine has now extended to coincide with that of medical practice. There is increasing evidence, not only in psychiatry, but in all medical fields, that care of the mental well-being of a person is essential for effective care of the body.

A case-control sample matched on propensity score showed a moderate association in female (OR, 1.79) and male (1.53) twins. A PDE strongly predicted risk for MD in female (OR, 3.68) and male (5.20) twins in the entire sample. In monozygotic pairs discordant for exposure, the association was weaker in male (OR, 1.41) and absent in female (1.00) twins. A case-control sample matched on propensity score showed a moderate association between PDE and depressive episodes in male (OR, 1.58) and female twins (1.66).\nAlthough dSLEs have a modest causal effect on the risk for MD, a large proportion of the observed association is noncausal. The same pattern is seen for PDEs, although the causal impact is somewhat more tenuous. For environmental exposures in psychiatry that cannot be studied experimentally, co-twin control and propensity scoring methods--which have complementary strengths and weaknesses--can provide similar results, suggesting their joint use can help with the critical question of causal inference."}, {"Title": "Points of contact: using first-person narratives to help foster empathy in psychiatric residents.", "Abstract": "The authors aimed to determine if writing narratives in psychiatric training can foster empathy for severely and persistently mentally ill patients.\nOne resident wrote first-person narrative pieces about three different patients at a community mental health clinic.

The supervisor and resident examined the style of writing, choice of words, and story line to help the resident learn about her feelings about the patient.\nIn each narrative, different choices were made that provided clues about that particular resident-patient relationship. These writing exercises helped the resident become more connected to her patients, develop interviewing skills, and engage in more self-reflection.\nNarrative writing effectively fostered empathy in a PGY-1 psychiatric resident working with severely and persistently mentally ill patients.

Despite the best intentions, partnerships that simply transport students to Western medical schools for training have shockingly low return rates. Ethiopia, for example, has sent hundreds of physicians abroad for specialty training over the past 30 years, the vast majority of whom have not returned. This represents a highly problematic net transfer of financial and human resources from the Ethiopian people to Western countries that have failed to develop their own adequate health human resource plans.\nWith this background in mind, in 2003 Addis Ababa University invited the University of Toronto to collaborate on the first Ethiopian psychiatric residency program to be run entirely in Ethiopia. Called the Toronto Addis Ababa Psychiatry Project (TAAPP), it was established on the principle of supplementing the ability of the small Addis Ababa University Department of Psychiatry to teach, provide clinical supervision, and to help develop educational capacity. Over the last 6 years the model has involved a large number of University of Toronto faculty and residents who have spent blocks of 1 month each in Addis Ababa.\nThis article describes the first three phases of TAAPP (I) Development of a model residency program; (II) Enhancing clinical, educational and leadership capacity; and (III) Sustainability, faculty development, and continuing education.

Nevertheless, diet affects brain chemistry (particularly serotonin), and can reduce abnormal behavior in humans and animals. We formulated a diet that elevated brain serotonin and tested whether it would reduce hair pulling in a mouse model of trichotillomania. In a double-blind crossover trial, dietary elevation of brain serotonin unexpectedly increased hair pulling (P = 0.0006) and induced ulcerative dermatitis (UD; P = 0.001). The causative agent for UD is unknown. Therefore, we fed the treatment diet to a second group of mice to test whether UD is behavioral in origin. The diet increased scratching behavior (P < 0.0001). However, high scratching behavior (P = 0.027) and low barbering (P = 0.040) prior to treatment predicted the development of UD. Thus diet can trigger the onset of a complex disorder in the absence of an underlying metabolic deficit.

This point is illustrated by a conceptual analysis of the five principles formulated in Kandel's 1998 article \"A New Intellectual Framework for Psychiatry.\" Kandel's position in the philosophical mind-body debate is ambiguous, ranging from reductive physicalism (psychophysical identity theory) to non-reductive physicalism (in which the mental \"supervenes\" on the physical) to epiphenomenalist dualism or even emergent dualism.

Today his work remains valuable for its insistence on the inextricability of the \"physical and the moral\" in psycho-gastric illness."}, {"Title": "Conversion disorder: a problematic diagnosis.", "Abstract": "The diagnosis of conversion disorder is problematic. Since doctors have conceptually and practically differentiated the symptoms from neurological ('organic') disease it has been presumed to be a psychological disorder, but the psychological mechanism, and how this differs from feigning (conscious simulation), has remained elusive. Although misdiagnosis of neurological disease as conversion disorder is uncommon, it remains a concern for clinicians, particularly for psychiatrists who may be unaware of the positive ways in which neurologists can exclude organic disease. The diagnosis is anomalous in psychiatry in that current diagnostic systems require that feigning is excluded and that the symptoms can be explained psychologically. In practice, feigning is very difficult to either disprove or prove, and a psychological explanation cannot always be found. Studies of childhood and adult psychological precipitants have tended to support the relevance of stressful life events prior to symptom onset at the group level but they are not found in a substantial proportion of cases. These problems highlight serious theoretical and practical issues not just for the current diagnostic systems but for the concept of the disorder itself. Psychology, physiology and functional imaging techniques have been used in attempts to elucidate the neurobiology of conversion disorder and to differentiate it from feigning, but while intriguing results are emerging they can only be considered preliminary. Such work looks to a future that could refine our understanding of the disorder. However, until that time, the formal diagnostic requirement for associated psychological stressors and the exclusion of feigning are of limited clinical value. Simplified criteria are suggested which will also encourage cooperation between neurology and psychiatry in the management of these patients."}, {"Title": "NIH Roundtable on Opportunities to Advance Research on Neurologic and Psychiatric Emergencies.", "Abstract": "The Institute of Medicine Committee on the Future of Emergency Care in the United States Health System (2003) identified a need to enhance the research base for emergency care. As a result, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Task Force on Research in Emergency Medicine was formed to enhance NIH support for emergency care research. Members of the NIH Task Force and academic leaders in emergency care participated in 3 Roundtable discussions to prioritize current opportunities for enhancing and conducting emergency care research. We identify key research questions essential to advancing the science of emergency care and discuss the barriers and strategies to advance research by exploring the collaboration between NIH and the emergency care community.\nExperts from emergency medicine, neurology, psychiatry, and public health assembled to review critical areas in need of investigation, current gaps in knowledge, barriers, and opportunities. Neurologic emergencies included cerebral resuscitation, pain, stroke, syncope, traumatic brain injury, and pregnancy. Mental health topics included suicide, agitation and delirium, substances, posttraumatic stress, violence, and bereavement.\nPresentations and group discussion firmly established the need for translational research to bring basic science concepts into the clinical arena. A coordinated continuum of the health care system that ensures rapid identification and stabilization and extends through discharge is necessary to maximize overall patient outcomes. There is a paucity of well-designed, focused research on diagnostic testing, clinical decisionmaking, and treatments in the emergency setting. Barriers include the limited number of experienced researchers in emergency medicine, limited dedicated research funding, and difficulties of conducting research in chaotic emergency environments stressed by crowding and limited resources. Several themes emerged during the course of the roundtable discussion, including the need for development of (1) a research infrastructure for the rapid identification, consent, and tracking of research subjects that incorporates innovative informatics technologies, essential for future research; (2) diagnostic strategies and tools necessary to understand key populations and the process of medical decisionmaking, including the investigation of the pathobiology of symptoms and symptom-oriented therapies; (3) collaborative research networks to provide unique opportunities to form partnerships, leverage patient cohorts and clinical and financial resources, and share data; (4) formal research training programs integral for creating new knowledge and advancing the science and practice of emergency medicine; and (5) recognition that emergency care is part of an integrated system from emergency medical services dispatch to discharge. The NIH Roundtable \"Opportunities to Advance Research on Neurological and Psychiatric Emergencies\" created a framework to guide future emergency medicine-based research initiatives.\nEmergency departments provide the portal of access to the health care system for most patients with acute neurologic and psychiatric illness.

Recently in France, the Activities Daily Life (ADL) scale has been proposed by the French authorities to assess social functioning for all hospitalized patients in a psychiatric ward. The perspective is to use this scale in the financing and organization of mental health services in France. The ADL scale is a 6-item (dressing/undressing, walking/mobility, eating/drinking, using toilets, behaviour, relationships/communication) heteroquestionnaire completed by a health care professional at the beginning of each hospitalization, assessing functioning of patients suffering from mental health diseases. However, limited consensus exists on this scale. The psychometric properties of the ADL scale have not been assessed. There is a pressing need for detailed examination of its performance. The aim of this study was to explore ADL psychometric properties in a sample of hospitalized patients in a psychiatric ward.\nWe retrospectively analyzed data for all episodes of care delivered to hospitalized patients in a psychiatric ward in our French Public Hospital from January 1, 2008 to June 30, 2008. The study involved retrospective review of administrative and medical databases. The following data were collected: age, gender, diagnoses based on the International Classification of Diseases - 10th version, ADL scale and Assessment of Social Self-Sufficiency scale (ASSS). The psychometric properties were examined using construct validity, reliability, external validity, reproducibility and sensitivity to change. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0 and WINSTEP software.\nA total of 1066 patients completed the ADL scale. Among them, 49.7% were male, mean age was 36.5 \u00b1 10.8, and 83.5% were single. Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders (40.0%), mood disorders (27.9%) and mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use (12%) were the most common diagnoses. Factor analysis with varimax rotation identified a 2-factor structure accounting for 82% of the total variance. The first dimension (ADL 1) comprised four items and represented personal care activities. The second dimension (ADL 2) comprised two items and represented social functioning. A floor effect was reported for ADL 1 and its unidimensionality was not satisfactory: two items showed an INFIT statistic outside the acceptable range. Internal consistency was satisfactory for the two dimensions: each item achieved the 0.40 standard for item-internal consistency. The correlation of each item with its contributory dimension was higher than with the other (item discriminant validity). Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranged over 0.70 in the whole sample. Concerning external validity, positive correlations were not systematically found between ADL and ASSS dimensions. The score of ADL 1 had medium to high correlations with four dimensions scores of the ASSS, while the score of ADL 2 were not at all or weakly correlated with ASSS dimension scores. Globally, ADL did not cover sentimental life and social relationships. There were statistical associations between ADL and age or gender: women and subjects older than 60 had a higher level of dependency. We didn't find any association with marital status or diagnoses. The ADL scale presented a good reproducibility but was not sensitive to change.\nThe psychometric properties of the ADL scale were not sufficient for several parameters such as validity or sensitivity to change, contrary to other available French scales. The use of a heteroquestionnaire rather than a self-administered questionnaire should be discussed by professionals and the French authorities. These results should be taken into account in the use of the ADL scale for the economic and administrative management of psychiatry. Further research should be conducted to confirm these results."}, {"Title": "Women in French medicine and psychiatry in the belle \u00e9poque: a feminist cause?", "Abstract": "In France, women's relatively early admission to the medical profession (1868) and to psychiatry (1903) co-existed with a conservative gender discourse concerning women's presumed and pre-determined domestic role.

The study of problem in this context demands the implementation of the interdisciplinary system to provide the complimentary methodological approach to more comprehensive understanding of historical patterns of development of science and its perspectives. A good example of such a system is synergetics which provide the possibility to evaluate different characteristics and patterns of non-linear historical process.

The 1970s witnessed a remarkable turnaround when the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the American Psychological Association called for psychologists to work to remove the stigma historically associated with homosexuality. This history illustrates not only how cultural institutions play a central role in legitimating stigma, but also how they can recognize their own complicity in this process and work effectively to undo its harmful effects. It is argued that Psychology still has an important role to play in challenging the differences-as-deficits model in contemporary policy debates."}, {"Title": "Comparison of DRD2 rs1800497 (TaqIA) polymorphism between schizophrenic patients and healthy controls: Lack of association in a Turkish sample.", "Abstract": "Abstract Objective. The association of DRD2 rs1800497 (TaqIA) polymorphisms and schizophrenia has been studied in a number of populations, but the results are contradictory. We aimed to define Taq IA allelic differences between schizophrenic and healthy subjects. Methods. The schizophrenic group consisted of 99 schizophrenic inpatients, diagnosed and treated at Gazi University Hospital Psychiatry Service, the healthy group was composed of 109 subjects who did not suffer from any psychiatric or organic diseases. High molecular weight genomic DNAs were prepared from peripheral venous blood cells by using proteinase K digestion followed by salt extraction method. Target DNA amplification of DRD2 gene (Taq1A, 310-bp region) was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the primers 5014 and 971. Results. Of the 208 subjects involved in the study, 98.6% had A1 allele (hetero- or homo-zygote) and 1.4% had A2 allele (homozygote). While all schizophrenia patients had A1 allele, 97.2%, of the healthy subjects (n=106) had A1 allele and there was no significant difference between the groups. Conclusion. This study was the first study related to DRD2 polymorphism conducted in a Turkish schizophrenic patient sample. A great percentage of our sample has A1 allele.

Also, the major schools of psychotherapy emerged during an era of individualism and logical positivism reflecting the religious, ethical, and cultural heritage that has shaped the modern Western society. Consequently, the methods and techniques developed in the West may not be always suitable and effective for Muslim Americans. To respond to the growing needs of psychiatric problems encountered by Muslim Americans, many community social service centers have been established in the United States during the past two decades. We now have a growing body of research data suggesting how to tailor our field to the specific needs of this population.

Only 21% of psychiatrists reported a clear understanding of psychodermatology in terms of the interface between skin and the psyche. Twenty-two percent of the respondents reported being very comfortable in diagnosing and treating psychocutaneous disorders. Self-inflicted cutaneous lesions were reported as the most common psychiatric condition associated with a dermatologic component.

While the professional and scientific context of the day promoted eugenic and racist ideas within the framework of the academic milieu and the curriculum of the medical and scientific community, eugenicists in Poland tended to refrain from anti-Semitic and racist phraseology. Indeed, the Polish eugenic movement was class- rather than race-orientated. The hybrid language of eugenics, combining social sensitivity with repulsion and contempt for the sick and the weak, illustrated the ambiguous stance of the Polish eugenicists on politics and science in Nazi Germany, for the Third Reich provided the German eugenicists with what had always been an unfulfilled dream to the Polish eugenicists--political power and the ability to implement their ideas."}, {"Title": "Reducing the treatment gap for mental disorders: a WPA survey.", "Abstract": "The treatment gap for people with mental disorders exceeds 50% in all countries of the world, approaching astonishingly high rates of 90% in the least resourced countries.

In particular they reflect a growing research interest in the view that certain adverse social conditions may detrimentally affect mental or physical health by acting as chronic stressors. However, although the case for chronic arousal of stress systems as a risk factor for mental health is empirically well-founded, questions remain about how and why psychological exposure to certain kinds of proximal social conditions might contribute to such arousal.

This phenomenon is evolutionary conserved among several vertebrate species and has relevance to the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Why do we need novel animal models? Although significant progress has been achieved with the use of traditional mammalian models, there are major pitfalls associated with their use that impedes progress on two major fronts: 1) uncovering of the molecular mechanisms underlying aspects of compromised (stress-exposed) brain development relevant to the etiology of psychiatric disorders, and 2) ability to develop high-throughput technology for drug discovery in the field of psychiatry. The zebrafish model helps resolve these issues. Here we present a conceptual framework for the use of zebrafish in stress research and psychiatry by addressing three specific domains of application: 1) stress research, 2) human disease mechanisms, and 3) drug discovery.

The TCI R mean scores and standard deviations were compared between Serbian and US subjects, internal consistency of the TCI R scales was estimated using Cronbach's alpha coefficients, and principal component analysis was used separately for temperament and character (because of their non-linear relationship) to test the underlying factorial structure of the TCI R. Parallel analysis and randomized simulation data were used to determine the number of factors for temperament and character.\nThe results generally supported the construct validity and the cross cultural applicability of the TCI R in Serbia. With a few exceptions, the observed internal consistency for the TCI R scales was acceptable. For the most part, the US and Serbian subjects manifested comparable temperament traits, whereas US subjects had higher character scores. The observed differences are understood as partly reflective of local culture and partly of dramatic socio-economic change in Serbia over the last 20 years.

This review attempts to answer the following questions: (1) Is there evidence of significantly increased risk of metabolic syndrome in SMDs? (2) How is this evidence explained by stress theory and functional polymorphism? (3) What role can psychopharmacology and psychosocial therapies play in minimizing the problem? We have done a historical review using related literature from Medline. Compared with the general population, metabolic syndrome is two to three times more common in SMDs. The evidence for this predates the era of antipsychotic drugs. Altered glucose metabolism and dyslipidemia seem to be integral to SMDs. However, major psychotropic drugs are associated with metabolic syndrome, because of their activity at the appetite-stimulating receptors. SMDs seem to trigger a pathogenic cycle that fuels metabolic syndrome. To explain these findings, a neural diathesis-stress model has been proposed. Furthermore, candidate genes associated with receptors for weight gain are implicated. Using metformin (\u2265750\u2009mg/day) may significantly reduce metabolic risks, and the data support consideration of this intervention for psychiatric patients taking antipsychotics. The obstacles to the implementation of the available guidelines for monitoring metabolic effects and changing unhelpful lifestyles need to be overcome by making monitoring mandatory and integration of physical exercise into routine care.

After summarising the historical facts and the slow and still going-on process of illuminating and understanding what happened, some ethical consequences are drawn. What can we learn from history? The following aspects are addressed: the special situation of psychiatry in times of war, bioethics and biopolitics, the responsibility of the psychiatrist for the individual patient, the effects of hierarchy on personal conscience and responsibility, the unethical \"curable-uncurable\" distinction and the atrocious concept that persons differ in their value."}, {"Title": "[Neuropsychological issues in child psychology and child psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Neuropsychological aspects are of relevance to a variety of psychological concerns, especially in assessments. But is this trend represented in journals which do not explicitly refer to neuropsychologists? To investigate this question, publications in 2008 and 2009 editions of representative German journals on child psychology and psychiatry were bibliometrically analyzed. Main topics of neuropsychological publications were attention disorders and diagnostic issues. Neuropsychological findings support the development of assessment instruments and interventions and help improve the basic understanding of disorders and treatment limitations. For example, reduced attention or memory resources are possible hindrances for individual progress in cognitive behavioral intervention. An intensified dialogue of the disciplines is essential for developing advanced guidelines for diagnostics and therapy."}, {"Title": "\"Communication by impact\" and other forms of non-verbal communication: a review of transference, countertransference and projective identification.", "Abstract": "This article aims to review the importance, place and especially the emotional impact of non-verbal communication in psychiatry. The paper argues that while biological psychiatry is in the ascendency with increasing discoveries being made about the functioning of the brain and psycho-pharmacology, it is important to try and understand what is happening between psychiatrist and patient. The importance of being aware of the subtleties of this interaction is argued, as are the roles of phenomena such as transference, counter-transference and projective identification. The workings and use of these phenomena are explored as central in the doctor-patient interaction, as well as the consequences of failure to utilize and understand these phenomena.

This review will focus on the molecular mechanism by which calcium-dependent gene expression regulates brain development and how ASD may occur if this process is compromised. Specifically, the studies of the calcium-dependent transcriptional repressor MeCP2 gave us much insight about how abnormal development may lead to ASD. Most recently, studies about Ube3a, a critical component of the ubiquitination system enzyme, shed light on how neural activity regulates synapse function through the protein degradation pathway. Taken together, these studies suggest that ASD may be caused by the incapability of neurons to generate adaptive responses via regulating gene expression upon incoming activity."}, {"Title": "The psychiatric GWAS consortium: big science comes to psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The Psychiatric GWAS Consortium was founded with the aim of conducting statistically rigorous and comprehensive GWAS meta-analyses for five major psychiatric disorders: ADHD, autism, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia.

The present study aims to examine the convergent validity of the Brazilian version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children/Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) by comparison with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a parental screening measure for child/adolescent emotional/behavior problems.\nAn experienced child psychiatrist blind to CBCL results applied the K-SADS-PL to a consecutive sample of 78 children (6-14 years) referred to a public child mental health outpatient clinic (response rate = 75%). Three K-SADS-PL parameters were considered regarding current disorders: parent screen interview rates, clinician summary screen interview rates, and final DSM-IV diagnoses. Subjects were classified according to the presence/absence of any affective/anxiety disorder, any disruptive disorder, and any psychiatric disorder based on K-SADS-PL results. All subjects obtained T-scores on CBCL scales (internalizing, externalizing, total problems).\nSignificant differences in CBCL mean T-scores were observed between disordered and non-disordered children. Compared to children who screened negative, children positive for any affective/anxiety disorder, any disruptive disorder, and any psychiatric disorder had a higher internalizing, externalizing and total problem T-score mean, respectively. Highly significant differences in T-score means were also found when examining final diagnoses, except for any affective/anxiety disorder.\nEvidence of convergent validity was found when comparing K-SADS-PL results with CBCL data."}, {"Title": "Posttraumatic stress disorder: a history and a critique.", "Abstract": "Although posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is sometimes considered to be a relatively new diagnosis, as the name first appeared in 1980, the concept of the disorder has a very long history. That history has often been linked to the history of war, but the disorder has also been frequently described in civilian settings involving natural disasters, mass catastrophes, and serious accidental injuries. The diagnosis first appeared in the official nomenclature when Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-I was published in 1952 under the name gross stress reaction. It was omitted, however, in the next edition in 1968, after a long period of relative peace. When DSM-III was developed in the mid-1980s the recent occurrence of the Vietnam War provoked a more thorough examination of the disorder. PTSD was defined as a stress disorder that is a final common pathway occurring as a consequence of many different types of stressors, including both combat and civilian stress. The definition of PTSD has filled an important niche in clinical psychiatry. Its definition continues to raise important questions about the relationship between a stressor, the individual experiencing it, and the characteristic symptoms."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry during National Socialism: historical knowledge, implications for present day ethical debates].", "Abstract": "This contribution is a synthesis of the results of historical research on psychiatry during the Nazi period and some implications for present day debates in medical ethics. The focus is on three issues: the relationship between physicians and the state, the impact of eugenically and economically motivated health and social policies for psychiatry (e.g. forced sterilization, patient killing/euthanasia) and psychiatric research. Three myths are deconstructed: 1) that medical atrocities were imposed from above by Nazi politicians on apolitical physicians, 2) that mass sterilization and patient killing had nothing to do with contemporary state of the art of medical reasoning and practice and 3) that ethically unacceptable research on psychiatric patients had nothing to do with the contemporary state of the art of biomedical sciences. It is argued that the findings on these issues of Nazi medicine are not specific to Germany and the period between 1933 and 1945 but they were the extreme manifestations of some potential problems implicit in modern medicine in general."}, {"Title": "The recovery education in the academy program: transforming academic curricula with the principles of recovery and self-determination.", "Abstract": "This article describes a curricular transformation initiative, the Recovery Education in the Academy Program (REAP), spearheaded by the University of Illinois at Chicago's National Research and Training Center on Psychiatric Disability.\nREAP is designed to integrate principles of recovery, self-determination, and other evidence-based practices for people with psychiatric disabilities into medical, social, and behavioral sciences curricula.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the symptoms used for the diagnoses of atypical and melancholic depression can distinguish these subtypes during pregnancy. A modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID interview) was used that allowed assessment of all DSM IV symptoms of melancholic and atypical depression with depressed and non-depressed women in pregnancy. A Swiss cohort of 449 women was interviewed. Four diagnostic groups were compared: women with melancholic, atypical or non specified depression, and those without depression. Seventeen per cent of the cohort met SCID criteria for a depressive episode of depression at least once in pregnancy, with melancholic depression 2.4%, atypical depression 4.4% and non specified depression 10.2%. Many of the symptoms used to distinguish atypical and melancholic depression did not discriminate between these groups during pregnancy. However some, such as mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood and sleep pattern, did discriminate. Differential diagnosis between melancholic and atypical depression in pregnancy needs to be based on pregnancy specific definitions.

Per calender year, 50,000 to 63,000 children and adolescents were retrospectively observed with respect to the documentation of ADHD diagnosis (ICD-10 diagnosis F90) and the prescribing of methylphenidate (ATC: N06BA04).\nIn 2007, the overall prevalence of ADHD in all age groups (0-18 years) was 2.21% (95% CI: 2.09-2.34). This figure was 45% greater than the corresponding figure for the year 2000. The prevalence increased by a larger amount among girls aged 6 to 18 years than among boys in the same age group (+69% vs. +53%). In 2007, 1.06% (95% CI: 0.98-1.16) of the children/adolescents received at least one prescription for methylphenidate; this was a 96% increase over the prescription rate for 2000. A comparison of the two years 2000 and 2007 reveals a clear prevalence shift towards the older age groups, as well as an 82% increase in the average number of daily doses per recipient. Outpatient departments of child and adolescent psychiatry initiated more treatments in 2007 than in 2000.\nThe 1% prevalence of methylphenidate use among children and adolescents that was found in this study is the same as that reported in other European countries, such as Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Norway. A drawback of our study is its limitation to a single insurance carrier in a single region. Nonetheless, data of this type are useful for monitoring.

As this field and its research base are relatively new, clinicians often deliver psychiatric care to athletes without a full understanding of the diagnostic and therapeutic issues unique to this population. In this systematic review, we discuss published findings relating to psychiatric diagnosis and medical treatment of mental illness in athletes. There have been several studies looking at the prevalence of some psychiatric disorders in various athlete populations. Eating disorders and substance abuse are the most studied of these disorders and appear to be common problems in athletes. However, to provide informed understanding and treatment, we especially need more research on overtraining syndrome, bipolar disorder, suicidality, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and psychosis in athletes. Research is needed in the areas of prevalence, risk factors, prognosis and the unique experiences facing athletes with any of these disorders. Additionally, there have not been any large, systematic studies on the use of psychotropic medications in athletes. Small studies suggest that some medications may either be performance enhancing or detrimental to performance, but we need larger studies with rigorous methodology. Higher level athletes suffering from psychiatric symptoms often have reservations about taking medications with unknown performance and safety effects, and methodological issues with the current literature database preclude any definitive conclusions on performance effects of psychiatric medications. We need many more, higher quality studies on the use by athletes of antidepressants, mood stabilizers, anxiolytics, stimulants and other ADHD medications, sedative-hypnotics and antipsychotics. Such studies should utilize sensitive performance measures and involve longer term use of psychotropic medications. Furthermore, study subjects should include athletes who actually have the psychiatric disorder for which the medication is proposed, and should include more women."}, {"Title": "Suicide and schizophrenia: a systematic review of rates and risk factors.", "Abstract": "Risk assessment is a core skill in psychiatry. Risk prediction for suicide in schizophrenia is known to be complex. We undertook a systematic review of all original studies concerning suicide in schizophrenia published since 2004. We found 51 data-containing studies (from 1281 studies screened) that met our inclusion criteria, and ranked these by standardized quality criteria. Estimates of rates of suicide and risk factors associated with later suicide were identified, and the risk factors were grouped according to type and strength of association with suicide. Consensus on the lifetime risk of suicide was a rate of approximately 5%. Risk factors with a strong association with later suicide included being young, male, and with a high level of education. Illness-related risk factors were important predictors, with number of prior suicide attempts, depressive symptoms, active hallucinations and delusions, and the presence of insight all having a strong evidential basis. A family history of suicide, and comorbid substance misuse were also positively associated with later suicide. The only consistent protective factor for suicide was delivery of and adherence to effective treatment. Prevention of suicide in schizophrenia will rely on identifying those individuals at risk, and treating comorbid depression and substance misuse, as well as providing best available treatment for psychotic symptoms."}, {"Title": "Informing cancer patient in relation to his type of personality: the controlling-orderly (obsessive) patient.", "Abstract": "The questions \"Do you tell the diagnosis or not? How much information do you reveal? Who do you inform about the diagnosis and/or what do you tell\" are very frequent during scientific discussions. Must the patients know or do they also have the right not to know? Is it possible to determine who should be told what, when and how? Is it possible individualizing the informing of a cancer patient according to his character or type of personality? The aim of this paper was to describe the Controlling- Orderly (C-O) character, so any therapist can build up an information strategy to cancer patients. This study took place within the framework of Consulting- Liaison (C-L) psychiatry and included: 1) Training groups in which doctors and nurses participated. 2) The section of C-L Psychiatry of the Psychiatry Department. 3) The training activity in the framework of C-L Psychiatry. 4) The annual seminars of psychooncology for health professionals. How a doctor could use the characteristics of a C-O patient for an empathetic approach and correctly inform him. And how to approach his denial and family in order to tailor the information strategy. Understanding the personality type of C-O patient, his denial mechanisms and the dynamics within his family maximizes the therapist's empathetic approach towards the cancer patient. The therapist can respond at \"what, when and how\" about to break bad news. A therapist must take into account the main C-O patient characteristics (control and order), as well as the attributes or cognitions: the tendency to use reason, the mechanism of rationalization by which he exercises mental control that leads to doubt. The denial degree is small to minimal, while the degree of information is large to very large."}, {"Title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation and connectivity mapping: tools for studying the neural bases of brain disorders.", "Abstract": "There has been an increasing emphasis on characterizing pathophysiology underlying psychiatric and neurological disorders in terms of altered neural connectivity and network dynamics. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a unique opportunity for investigating connectivity in the human brain. TMS allows researchers and clinicians to directly stimulate cortical regions accessible to electromagnetic coils positioned on the scalp. The induced activation can then propagate through long-range connections to other brain areas. Thus, by identifying distal regions activated during TMS, researchers can infer connectivity patterns in the healthy human brain and can examine how those patterns may be disrupted in patients with different brain disorders. Conversely, connectivity maps derived using neuroimaging methods can identify components of a dysfunctional network. Nodes in this dysfunctional network accessible as targets for TMS by virtue of their proximity to the scalp may then permit TMS-induced alterations of components of the network not directly accessible to TMS via propagated effects. Thus TMS can provide a portal for accessing and altering neural dynamics in networks that are widely distributed anatomically. Finally, when long-term modulation of network dynamics is induced by trains of repetitive TMS, changes in functional connectivity patterns can be studied in parallel with changes in patient symptoms. These correlational data can elucidate neural mechanisms underlying illness and recovery. In this review, we focus on the application of these approaches to the study of psychiatric and neurological illnesses."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry, neurology, and the role of the cerebellum.", "Abstract": "The cerebellum has long been considered quite separate from the neocortex, and accordingly the understanding of its role has been limited.

However, collaboration between mental health services and clergy may be problematic, particularly in the resolution of conflicting beliefs and therapeutic modalities. For example, belief in demonic possession and other supernatural causes of mental illness, which are contentious among secular medical practitioners, remain prevalent in many ethnoreligious communities. Thus, interpretations of illness by clergy within health systems may be crucial to appropriate intervention for people with mental illness. However, clergy conceptualizations of suffering also reveal something about the secularization within religious institutions through the despiritualization of particular phenomena. This paper on Christian clergy beliefs and attitudes to supernatural explanations, describes how the negotiation of such beliefs are complex and often equivocal among mainstream clergy but integral to the Pentecostal churches and evangelical clergy in the mainstream, institutional churches. These beliefs and their implications for collaboration with psychiatry are discussed in the context of a rapidly changing religious and cultural landscape."}, {"Title": "Neurology outside Paris following Charcot.", "Abstract": "The Middle Ages saw the development of numerous universities in the different provinces that later became the kingdom of France. In 1794, Napoleon I established 3 medical schools in Paris, Montpellier and Strasbourg, which were transformed into medical faculties in 1808. France had always been a highly centralized country, but during the 19th century, this trend started to change with the creation of medical faculties in Nancy (1872), Lille (1877), Lyon (1878), Bordeaux (1879), Toulouse (1891), Algiers (1910) and Marseille (1930). Following the creation of the 12 foundation courses, specialized chairs were progressively established in Paris, but for a long time this remained restricted to the French capital. However, with the emergence of medicine as an academic discipline in several towns outside Paris, came the development of neurology. This was greatly influenced by former students of Jean-Martin Charcot, local personalities, and the interactions between the two. Leading figures included Albert Pitres in Bordeaux, L\u00e9on Ingelrans in Lille, Eug\u00e8ne Devic and Jules Froment in Lyon, Lucien Cornil in Marseille, Joseph Grasset in Montpellier, and Marcel Riser in Toulouse. The interaction between French and Germanic medical communities also developed at this turbulent time under the influence of several great physicians such as Wilhelm Waldeyer, Adolf Kussmaul, and later Jean Alexandre Barr\u00e9 in Strasbourg, and Hippolyte Bernheim in Nancy. There are a number of other university towns outside Paris in which the development of neurology was probably influenced by the same interactions with psychiatry. It would be worth carrying out a thorough analysis of these towns in order to present an exhaustive overview of the development of neurology in France."}, {"Title": "Pierre Janet, Sigmund Freud and Charcot's psychological and psychiatric legacy.", "Abstract": "A key moment in the history of psychiatry occurred during Charcot's time at La Salp\u00eatriere. Though his studies on hysteria and hypnotism, the founder of neurology inspired the work of two of his alumni: a Viennese Nervenartz and a French philosopher interested in the dissociation of personality. Even though neither of them was originally an alienist, their respective work allowed the field of neurosis--then belonging to internal medicine--to pass to psychiatry. The parallel lives of these fr\u00e8res enemis, both of whom were treated differently by fame, developed inside a very complex cultural and scientific milieu. Therefore, it is necessary to consider them together with other physicians, some of whom are much less well-known nowadays, who one way or another carried Charcot's influence into psychiatry, psychology and psychotherapy. The fates of the Dioscuri have been reversed--the fame and success of Freudian psychoanalysis ran parallel to Janet's oblivion and his long 'purgatory', but now the 'renaissance' of his work coincides with the decline of psychoanalysis as a theoretical explanation for mental pathology."}, {"Title": "Paul Sollier: the first clinical neuropsychologist.", "Abstract": "Paul Sollier (1861-1933) is perhaps the most unjustly forgotten follower of Jean-Martin Charcot. He studied with D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Bourneville, Charcot's second interne, and was considered by L\u00e9on Daudet as the cleverest collaborator of Charcot, along with Joseph Babinski. Charcot assigned him the task of summarizing the theories on memory, which led to two major books, in 1892 and 1900, that anticipated several contemporary concepts by several decades. In 1905-1906, the novelist Marcel Proust spent 6 weeks with Sollier in his sanatorium at Boulogne-Billancourt, and it is now obvious that several of Proust's ideas on involuntary memories which appear inside In Search of Lost Time (published 8 years later) had been inspired by Sollier's theories on the 'surge of reminiscences'. Sollier also designed the framework which led to the intellectual quotient (IQ) and made interesting studies on hysteria and behavioral issues in neurological diseases, activities that may make him the first modern clinical neuro psychologist. Sollier was also the first to correlate clinical findings with neurophysiological concepts, which makes him a precursor of our current approach to neurology and psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Birth of modern psychiatry and the death of alienism: the legacy of Jean-Martin Charcot.", "Abstract": "At the time of Jean-Martin Charcot, Paris--the main center for studies on the nervous system and its disorders--was home to critical exchanges between the developing discipline of neurology and psychiatry. Contrary to the commonly held view, and in spite of an established tradition concerning mental diseases, emerging neurology had a much stronger influence on psychiatry ('alienism') than the reverse. This was largely due to the school built up by Jean-Martin Charcot himself, which was organized around the study and management of hysteria. Although Charcot always claimed to be uninterested in mental medicine, he stimulated the development of an original scientific approach to nervous system conditions, based on Claude Bernard's method, along with structured academic teaching. Conversely, alienism paradoxically remained stuck in organicism, after Antoine Bayle's report in 1822 of 'arachnitis' as the substratum of general paresis of the insane. Contrary to alienism, the young neurological school was capable of self-criticism, and progressively highlighted mental factors in hysteria. This led to the paradox that neurologists were active in a disease with no organic cerebral lesion, while alienists were postulating brain lesions in all mental disorders. Pushed by Charcot, the academic evolution led to the launch of a faculty chair of mental and brain diseases in 1875, which was taken over for nearly half a century by his direct pupils Benjamin Ball, Alix Joffroy and Gilbert Ballet, who held the position until 1916, supporting the development of modern psychiatry in general hospitals, while alienism progressively disappeared at the turn of the century."}, {"Title": "[Capabilities from the very beginning.

One specific variety of conflicts of interests has monopolized the attention of the scientific and lay press: the financial conflicts of interests arising from the relationships between doctors and drug companies. A large literature has described the many, sometimes subtle, ways by which a psychiatrist can be influenced in his prescribing habits or research activities by his relationships with the industry. Some empirical evidence is now available in this area. On the other hand, it has been pointed out that the current debate on this issue is sometimes \"affectively charged\" or fails to take into account that the interests of patients, families and mental health professionals and those of the industry may be often convergent. Other types of conflicts of interests are beginning now to be discussed. There is evidence that the allegiance of a researcher to a given school of thought may influence the results of studies comparing different psychotherapeutic techniques, thus colliding with the primary interest represented by the progress of science. Political commitment is also emerging as a source of conflicts of interests. Financial and non-financial conflicts of interests are widespread in psychiatric practice and research. They cannot be eradicated, but must be managed more effectively than is currently the case."}, {"Title": "Catatonia is hidden in plain sight among different pediatric disorders: a review article.", "Abstract": "Over the past two decades, catatonia has been better demarcated in adult psychiatry as a unique syndrome that consists of specific motor signs with a characteristic response to benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy. Pediatric catatonia is considered rare, but may be underdiagnosed, and hence undertreated. Discussed here are the current diagnostic criteria of catatonia in individual cases of children and adolescents diagnosed with childhood disintegrative disorder, Kleine-Levin syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, tic disorder, and autoimmune encephalitis, and the effects of benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy. In these cases, catatonia resolved safely once it was recognized and treated properly. Children and adolescents presenting with these disorders should be systematically assessed for catatonia; when the presence of catatonia is confirmed, the use of benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy should be considered. The occurrence of catatonia in such a wide range of child and adolescent disorders supports the view that pediatric catatonia is not so rare, that there are shared elements in the etiology, psychopathology, and pathophysiology of these disorders, and that catatonia is best classified as a unique neurobiologic syndrome."}, {"Title": "From reactive to proactive and selective control: developing a richer model for stopping inappropriate responses.", "Abstract": "A better understanding of the neural systems underlying impulse control is important for psychiatry. Although most impulses are motivational or emotional rather than motoric per se, it is research into the neural architecture of motor response control that has made the greatest strides. This article reviews recent developments in the cognitive neuroscience of stopping responses. Most research of this kind has focused on reactive control-that is, how subjects stop a response outright when instructed by a signal. It is argued that reactive paradigms are limited as models of control relevant to psychiatry. Instead, a set of paradigms is advocated that begins to model proactive inhibitory control-that is, how a subject prepares to stop an upcoming response tendency. Proactive inhibitory control is generated according to the goals of the subject rather than by an external signal, and it can be selectively targeted at a particular response tendency. This may have wider validity than reactive control as an experimental model for stopping inappropriate responses."}, {"Title": "[Loss of sense and meaning, a neglected topic in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Inherent in human existence is one's need to give sense to one's life. It is this need that drives life forward. In this paper the terms 'giving sense' and 'giving meaning' are used more or less interchangeably. A life acquires meaning when goals are set and attempts are made to achieve them. Giving meaning to one's existence often involves engaging in altruistic activity. The need to give sense to one's life can be felt to be 'self generated' or metaphysically inspired, in other words inspired by a supernatural authority. Sense-deficiency is a mental condition which is barely recognised in psychiatry and hardly ever treated. Thorough research is needed to find the causes and the appropriate treatment and, in particular, to discover to what extent the spiritual domain is able to perform therapeutic functions. A discussion of certain aspects of this domain should be given a definitive place in the curriculum of trainee psychiatrists."}, {"Title": "Free will and mental disorder: exploring the relationship.", "Abstract": "A link between mental disorder and freedom is clearly present in the introduction of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). It mentions \"an important loss of freedom\" as one of the possible defining features of mental disorder. Meanwhile, it remains unclear how \"an important loss of freedom\" should be understood. In order to get a clearer view on the relationship between mental disorder and (a loss of) freedom, in this article, I will explore the link between mental disorder and free will. I examine two domains in which a connection between mental disorder and free will is present: the philosophy of free will and forensic psychiatry. As it turns out, philosophers of free will frequently refer to mental disorders as conditions that compromise free will and reduce moral responsibility. In addition, in forensic psychiatry, the rationale for the assessment of criminal responsibility is often explained by referring to the fact that mental disorders can compromise free will. Yet, in both domains, it remains unclear in what way free will is compromised by mental disorders. Based on the philosophical debate, I discuss three senses of free will and explore their relevance to mental disorders. I conclude that in order to further clarify the relationship between free will and mental disorder, the accounts of people who have actually experienced the impact of a mental disorder should be included in future research."}, {"Title": "Health-related quality of life in adolescents and young adults with high functioning autism-spectrum disorder.", "Abstract": "Over the last years, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has emerged as an important measure not only in somatic medicine but also in psychiatry. To date, there are only few reports on HRQOL in patients with autism-spectrum disorder (ASD). This study aimed at studying HRQOL in ASD patients with an IQ >70, using a self-report HRQOL questionnaire with cross-cultural validity.\nIn this cross-sectional study, twenty-six male adolescents and young adults with the diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome, high functioning autism and atypical autism were evaluated, using the German version of the WHOQOL-BREF HRQOL questionnaire.\nMean WHOQOL-BREF global scores were 60.6 (SD \u00b126.1), mean WHOQOL-BREF subscale scores were 70.1 (SD \u00b119.1) for the domain \"physical health\", 61.5 (SD \u00b121.9) for the domain \"psychological health\", 53.8 (SD \u00b123.5) for the domain \"social relationships\" and 67.9 (SD \u00b117.4) for the domain \"environment\". Compared to a reference population of healthy controls, our sample scored significantly lower in three of four WHOQOL-BREF domains. In comparison to a reference sample of individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD), HRQOL of our sample was significantly better in all domains except for the \"social relations\" domain. There was a significant association between HRQOL and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales domain \"daily living skills\", but not with age, IQ, or ADOS-G summary scores.\nOverall self-reported HRQOL in patients with high functioning ASD seems to be lower than in healthy individuals, but better than in patients with SSD. Also, higher HRQOL was associated with better daily living skills. This interrelationship should especially be accounted for in the design and application of treatment programmes for individuals with ASD, as it is of importance for the level of self-perceived HRQOL."}, {"Title": "British psychiatry and its discontents.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry in the UK is currently faced with serious difficulties arising from failure in recruiting British doctors and a high rate of early retirement from the specialty. To diagnose the underlying causes, account must be taken of government policies affecting the NHS in general and mental health services in particular. The latter include an excessive run-down of acute hospital beds, as well as projects aimed at changing the clinical role of psychiatrists and promoting mass treatment of milder mental disorders by non-medical personnel. Psychiatrists have reacted to these developments with anger and dismay, but have as yet reached no consensus with regard to either causal factors or appropriate response. Their uncertainty reflects the need for a firmer grasp of the historical background. Modern British psychiatry was effectively created and moulded as an integral part of the NHS. It flourished as long as the public service framework remained intact, but has suffered a decline since the whole structure began to buckle under the pressure of sustained political assaults. A clearer understanding of this vital connection would help to raise psychiatrists' morale and encourage them to establish common ground with medical colleagues and other healthcare professionals."}, {"Title": "[The psychometric value of the Verbal Short-Term Memory Scale by Arnold & Kohlmann in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Of various tests used to determine verbal short-term-memory deficits in mentally ill persons the Verbal Short-Term Memory Scale by Arnold and Kohlmann meets the important criteria of being fast, user-friendly and every day life-like, despite its old norms and questionable validity. The aim of this study was to assess the psychological value of this instrument by correlating it with those two subtests of the standardized Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), which assess verbal shortterm memory.\n478 random patients at a university psychiatric hospital, who were referred for psychological testing, were examined with the Verbal Short-Term Memory Scale by Arnold & Kohlmann and the subtests \"Logical Memory\" and \"Verbal Paired Associates\" of the Wechsler Memory Scale.\nPerformance by the total sample on both memory tests was in the lowest or just below the range of dispersion for normal values.

We examined the question of a possible association between the mental health reforms and the steady increase of the population of forensic mental hospitals becoming apparent since the introduction of community psychiatry.\nAll recent publications report a moderate albeit statistically significantly increased risk of criminality in patients suffering from schizophrenia, which becomes more obvious in severe, violent offences. In homicide it comes up to the 10-fold of that of the general population. Comorbid substance abuse has a substantial impact on the extent of illegal behaviour, however, even under consideration of alcohol abuse the risk of homicide amounts to about the 7-fold of that of the general population. Nearly all European countries give account on a remarkable increase of the incidence and prevalence rates of mentally disordered offenders. Patients suffering from schizophrenia are disproportionately affected by this development. However, the substantially increased risk of homicide in schizophrenic patients, reported already in the pre-reform era, remained stable over time. Accordingly, the rate of patients admitted to forensic-psychiatric treatment because of offences of minor severity is on the rise.\nThis development cannot be explained by single details of the mental health reforms, which show remarkable regional differences concerning numbers of mental hospital beds, ways of service provision, legal preconditions and rates of criminality and substance abuse. Rather, national and international data suggest changes of general societal attitudes to be the crucial factor. They have resulted in changes concerning the self-understanding of the representatives of modern mental healthcare. As aggressive behaviour is not integrated in the understanding of schizophrenia of present-day psychiatry, the objective needs of a subgroup of severely and chronically ill psychotic patients with high rates of comorbid substance abuse, lack of insight and compliance are increasingly neglected. The denial of these facts promotes the shift of 'difficult-to-treat patients' into forensic-psychiatric facilities and damages the reputation of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Cost savings of telemedicine utilization for child psychiatry in a rural Kansas community.", "Abstract": "The costs of pediatric telemedicine services remain underreported and understudied; however, there is evidence that telepediatric services can be cost competitive with traditional ones. For 15 years, the University of Kansas Center for Telemedicine and Telehealth has been providing telemental health outreach from the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). One service site is located in Crawford County, Kansas, which provides telepsychiatry services to children and adolescents. The purpose of this study was to examine the costs of operating the Crawford County site relative to accessing services at KUMC, the likely alternative service location. The cost of travel time to parents who accompanied a dependent to either location also was estimated. Patients and parents were examined over a 6-month period in 2006. One hundred thirty-two patients received 257 telemedicine psychiatric consultations during this period. Cost estimates for using the pediatric telemedicine service were assessed for all patients; however, travel and related costs were collected from a sample of 26 patient-parent dyads. The estimated costs of services were obtained using standard cost-accounting procedures. An average cost per consultation in Crawford County was $168.61. The cost savings in travel time and other expenses to parents and patients were substantial between use of the county site and KUMC. Subtracting average savings in travel costs to patients and parents produced an average cost of a telepsychiatry consult in Crawford County of only $30.99. This study was conducted over 6 months with a small number of observations; it should be replicated over a longer study period, with more patients, and with more data that might capture marginal costs of services."}, {"Title": "Clinical assessment and diagnosis of adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent disorder in adult psychiatry, particularly in out-patient settings. There are no objective, laboratory-based tests that can establish this diagnosis. Present diagnostic criteria for ADHD are formulated primarily according to behavior in childhood, based on age inappropriate and impairing levels of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. Other symptoms, such as mood instability and frustration intolerance, are not included in current criteria for ADHD, but are very prevalent in this patient group. ADHD is often comorbid with alcohol and substance abuse and other psychiatric disorders, in particular anxiety and personality disorders. Thus, the diagnostic assessment should both include a comprehensive clinical interview, rating scales for past and present symptoms and collateral information from multiple informants, as well as assessment of a broader spectrum of psychiatric and somatic conditions. As ADHD is associated with changes in brain function mediating different aspects of neuropsychological functions, assessment of those functions is important to understand the symptom patterns and to develop targeted treatment programs.

Using mail-based and web-based self-administered questionnaires, we evaluated participants' demographic information, motivation to become psychiatrists, interest and commitment to various aspects of psychiatry, and reactions to a case vignette, focusing on biopsychosocial factors.\nA total of 137 responses, 81 from Japan and 56 from other countries, were collected. Before starting psychiatric training, Japanese participants showed a strong interest in 'mind' and less interest in 'brain' and 'environmental factors', while the interest in 'brain' and 'environmental factors' is presently as high as that in 'mind.' Japanese participants reported less commitment to their training toward ICD/DSM-based diagnosis, interview, pharmacotherapy, psychosocial treatment and epidemiology, compared with participants from other countries. In particular, Japanese participants showed less commitment to their training in suicide prevention, despite their perception of its high importance due to a high suicide rate in Japan. Suicide risk of a case vignette proved to be differently assessed according to participants' commitment levels to each aspect of psychiatry.\nOur results suggest that young psychiatrists' attitudes concerning the biopsychosocial model generally become well-balanced with psychiatric training, however sociocultural factors do not seem to be well represented in the Japanese psychiatric training system.

Data were obtained on coercive measures (physical restraint, seclusion, and forced medication).\nIn total, 1,462 coercive measures were used with 770 patients (38%). The percentage of patients receiving coercive measures in each country varied between 21% and 59%. The most frequent reason for prescribing coercive measures was patient aggression against others. In eight of the countries, the most frequent measure used was forced medication, and in two of the countries mechanical restraint was the most frequent measure used. Seclusion was rarely administered and was reported in only six countries. A diagnosis of schizophrenia and more severe symptoms were associated with a higher probability of receiving coercive measures.\nCoercive measures were used in a substantial group of involuntarily admitted patients across Europe.

The rapprochement between neuroscience and psychoanalysis allows a new understanding of some concepts, including embodiment of mind, consciousness and attachment. The \"double reading\" paradigm allows a better understanding of symptomatic configurations. Linking neuroscience and psychoanalysis may improve treatments and result in new experimental neuroscientific paradigms involving changing the research object, changing the state of the research object, and investigating the structural changes in the brain following psychotherapy. The last aim is to create an epistemology of the articulation between the theoretical frameworks through phenomenology, \"complementarism\" and neuropsychoanalysis. We argue that it is necessary for clinicians to be aware of the advancements in each field.

It describes how environmental factors such as those associated with nutrition and/or stress may cause epigenetic changes which have transcriptional and phenotypic effects, which, in turn, alter the long term risk of developing an eating disorder. It reviews theoretical and practical issues associated with epigenetic studies in psychiatry and how these are relevant to eating disorders.

We aimed to establish whether burden of CNVs was increased in ADHD, and to investigate whether identified CNVs were enriched for loci previously identified in autism and schizophrenia.\nWe undertook a genome-wide analysis of CNVs in 410 children with ADHD and 1156 unrelated ethnically matched controls from the 1958 British Birth Cohort. Children of white UK origin, aged 5-17 years, who met diagnostic criteria for ADHD or hyperkinetic disorder, but not schizophrenia and autism, were recruited from community child psychiatry and paediatric outpatient clinics. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in the ADHD and control groups with two arrays; CNV analysis was limited to SNPs common to both arrays and included only samples with high-quality data. CNVs in the ADHD group were validated with comparative genomic hybridisation. We assessed the genome-wide burden of large (>500 kb), rare (<1% population frequency) CNVs according to the average number of CNVs per sample, with significance assessed via permutation.

Several kinds of mismatches among simultaneous sensory information are encountered in everyday life but despite these, the central nervous system usually manages to update the internal representation of the body in the surrounding space. In some cases, a sensory mismatch may elicit an erroneous perception of the body in space, resulting in anxiety, dizziness and balance problems. As vestibular system dysfunction leads to dizziness and disorientation, it has been hypothesized that a peripheral vestibular abnormality could explain the presence of certain symptoms related to sensory mismatches in anxiety disorders. Several studies tried to find a link between panic disorder with or without agoraphobia and vestibular system dysfunction. Yet, even though some vestibular abnormalities have been demonstrated in these patients, it is difficult to demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship between panic disorder and vestibular dysfunction. However, this does not rule out a possible influence of anxiety on normal vestibular function. The study of the relation between vestibular system and anxiety has to take into account that the vestibular system has three main functions: to maintain equilibrium through the vestibular spinal reflexes; to stabilize the visualization of the world through the vestibular-ocular reflex; to contribute to perception and orientation in space. We will review different studies in humans, which have particularly paid attention to the third function and its relation to anxiety. Animal experiments offer possibilities to more precisely analyze the different parameters underlying the behavioral results, as well as possible pharmacological actions on them. Two attempts have been made by our group to model, in mice, the preceding human data on integrated functional sensory relations of the body to space in anxiety disorders: the rotating beam and the rotating tunnel.

Six months analysis of the psychiatric illnesses of the patients from April 2010 up to October 2010 (n = 80) showed dissociative disorder (15%), and seizure disorder (15%) to be the most common diagnoses, followed by depressive disorder and intentional self harm (ISH) (13.8% each). 15% of patients were found to be treated by magico-religious means, with the majority of patients (66.7%) diagnosed as having dissociative disorder.\nThe majority of the paediatric population presenting to a psychiatry clinic were in the age group 15-18 years and of female sex. Dissociative disorder was the most common diagnosis followed by depressive disorders. The majority of patients with dissociative disorder had previously been treated by magico-religious means."}, {"Title": "Understanding the effects of stimulant medications on cognition in individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a decade of progress.", "Abstract": "The use of stimulant drugs for the treatment of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most widespread pharmacological interventions in child psychiatry and behavioral pediatrics. This treatment is well grounded on controlled studies showing efficacy of low oral doses of methylphenidate and amphetamine in reducing the behavioral symptoms of the disorder as reported by parents and teachers, both for the cognitive (inattention and impulsivity) and non-cognitive (hyperactivity) domains. Our main aim is to review the objectively measured cognitive effects that accompany the subjectively assessed clinical responses to stimulant medications. Recently, methods from the cognitive neurosciences have been used to provide information about brain processes that underlie the cognitive deficits of ADHD and the cognitive effects of stimulant medications. We will review some key findings from the recent literature, and then offer interpretations of the progress that has been made over the past decade in understanding the cognitive effects of stimulant medication on individuals with ADHD."}, {"Title": "Dynamical principles of emotion-cognition interaction: mathematical images of mental disorders.", "Abstract": "The key contribution of this work is to introduce a mathematical framework to understand self-organized dynamics in the brain that can explain certain aspects of itinerant behavior. Specifically, we introduce a model based upon the coupling of generalized Lotka-Volterra systems. This coupling is based upon competition for common resources. The system can be regarded as a normal or canonical form for any distributed system that shows self-organized dynamics that entail winnerless competition. Crucially, we will show that some of the fundamental instabilities that arise in these coupled systems are remarkably similar to endogenous activity seen in the brain (using EEG and fMRI). Furthermore, by changing a small subset of the system's parameters we can produce bifurcations and metastable sequential dynamics changing, which bear a remarkable similarity to pathological brain states seen in psychiatry. In what follows, we will consider the coupling of two macroscopic modes of brain activity, which, in a purely descriptive fashion, we will label as cognitive and emotional modes. Our aim is to examine the dynamical structures that emerge when coupling these two modes and relate them tentatively to brain activity in normal and non-normal states."}, {"Title": "Peculiarities of geriatric psychiatry: a focus on aging and depression.", "Abstract": "There is a debate on whether Geriatric Psychiatry stands for itself as a discrete specialty or whether it is an extension of clinical Geriatrics, Neurology, and Psychiatry. This review aims to outline some recent data and possible approaches to define peculiarities of Geriatric Psychiatry, focusing on certain characteristics that define the aging brain. Geriatric depression is discussed taking into consideration some data from translational research. The brain aging process is not uniform. Frontal areas show marked impairment in inhibiting irrelevant information in working memory as they age, and the recruitment of these areas occur differently than in young subjects. Executive functions also change in normal elderly. Geriatric depression is a general definition of a multidimensional disorder with multiple risk factors. Dysexecutive syndrome is considered as a key to the neuropsychology of geriatric depression, correlated with functional impairment in late life. Late-onset depression has a higher load of comordibity, of cerebrovascular disease, and of some genetic factors that may be different from early onset depression. Also, there are at least four clusters of treatment outcomes that are common in geriatric depression, which mirror the neuropsychological and clinical profiles. Research and practice in Geriatric Psychiatry should focus on the interaction of various dimensions and risk factors rather than on attempting to find a single cause to the disorders. Some answers may be found in comorbidity issues, in white matter lesions, which are more common in the elderly, and in genetic factors that impact on the aging process."}, {"Title": "Current challenges and future perspectives of the role of governments in the psychiatric/mental health systems of Latin America.", "Abstract": "The practices and systems of mental health in Latin America and the Caribbean are heterogeneous and are connected to dissociation between national macro systems and the complex quotidian that occurs in the daily attention of mental pathologies.

Currently the training and educational objectives focus on five major areas: undergraduate education (medical students); graduate education (psychiatric residents); psychiatric education for primary care physicians, as well as physicians in other medical specializations (psychosomatic training); public health and public education at large, and patient and family education, and the promotion of 'mental health' at a community level. Given the strong globalization process observed in all regions of the world in the past two or three decades, it is very important for Latin America to constantly review and update its psychiatric and behavioural sciences curriculum across all medical institutions and universities of the continent. New methods of teaching and novel approaches to education in the field of psychiatry are currently based on models that are also in use in other parts of the world, especially in the USA. Boards of certification for psychiatrists are being implemented all over the continent. Sound certification guarantees that the professional has followed and passed an educational training plan to make him/her qualified to start practising the profession. The future of psychiatric training will be closely bound to the future of the practice of psychiatry, and will have to get ahead of the challenges the specialism will face during the next decades."}, {"Title": "Child psychiatry and mental health in Latin America.", "Abstract": "The review of epidemiological studies of psychiatric disorders in children and teenagers in Latin America, is validated and updated in this article.

Dual pathology, new modalities such as injected heroin in countries such as Colombia, low coverage of programmes, training resources, research and publications are important challenges.

It dates back to the mid nineteenth century and widely developed during the twentieth century, with formidable scientific, social, political, and ethical challenges. Latin American psychiatry has contributed in the fields of epidemiology, phenomenology, social psychiatry, psychiatric and epistemological research, and clinical genetics as well. More recent advances can also be seen in clinical psychotherapy and psychopharmacology. Now, there is a formal and informal recognition of various areas of expertise, such as children and adolescents, addictions, anxiety disorders, among others. However, we need to solve the health problems resulting from mental illnesses as well as the disorders related to the social, environmental, political, and economic factors of a continent marked by the precariousness of underdevelopment, which have a high impact on population health. Therefore, considering and trying to minimize the impact of those factors, contributing to the destigmatization of mental illnesses and their consequences, together with the growing number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), human rights defenders, public figures, etc., and collaborating in building a society that guarantees the right to mental health and adequate treatment and rehabilitation are part of our present challenges in Latin America."}, {"Title": "Crossroads: Identity struggles in Latin America and Latin American psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Identity can be defined from different perspectives such as those from philosophy, social sciences and phenomenology. The latter entails sameness, uniqueness, distinctiveness, continuity, diversity, universality and equality connotations to define characteristics of the existence and action of individuals, institutions, entities, organizations and collectivities. In order to elaborate on the identity of Latin American Psychiatry, this chapter deals first with the identity of the Latin American continent, the result of a 'collision of cultures' with mestizaje as its most prominent collective contribution. In turn, the Latin American population (and its 'Hispanic' equivalent in other countries and regions of the world) has been the subject of a pluralistic search, and played a combined role of hope and conflict, advances and setbacks in a fascinating historical process. In such context, Latin American psychiatry offers a mixed identity, resulting from a succession of mythic-religious, moral, phenomenologico-existential, biological and social/community-based routes. Each of them are assessed, and the contributions of two eponymous figures, Honorio Delgado and Gregorio Bermann, are duly delineated. Current realities in Latin American psychiatry and mental health in socio-political, conceptual, professional, ideological, academic and heuristic areas, are examined. The chapter ends with considerations of the future of psychiatry in the continent, the postulation of a 'new synthesis' embracing the essence of contemporary neurobiological knowledge and a new, revitalized humanism in the context of a healthy eclecticism, progressive educational training and didactic programmes, and concrete contributions embodying the promise of well justified expectations."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry and human rights in Latin America: ethical dilemmas and the future.", "Abstract": "This paper addresses the context in which ethical and human right issues as they pertain to psychiatry are discussed in Latin America.

Yet, this traditional approach has been criticized due to excessive information and passive transfer of expert knowledge. An alternative teaching method is the use of \"academic games.\"\nTo investigate medical students' acquisition of knowledge on psychopharmacology, and their perception of a game playing approach compared to traditional lectures.\nTwo senior residents designed, implemented, and executed a randomized pretest-posttest study to teach psychopharmacology, using an academic game and a lecture format, to third-year medical students during a 6-week Psychiatry clerkship. Both didactic interventions were delivered concurrently for five consecutive weeks covering five psychopharmacology modules: antidepressants I (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and atypical antidepressants), antidepressants II (monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants), mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and anti-anxiety agents/sedatives/hypnotics. The game follows similar rules of the famous TV show, \"Jeopardy\" using a power point grid and a multiple choice question format.\nForty-three medical students participated (29 assigned to the game approach, 14 to the traditional lecture approach). None of the demographic variables (age, gender, years after graduation, Graduate Point Averages, and United States Medical Licensing Examination 1) were significantly associated with the pre/posttest score difference between groups. Both groups improved their knowledge on psychotropic drugs [(game group t = 10.86, p < 0.001); control t = 4.82, p < 0.001)] throughout the 6-week Psychiatry rotation. Students in the game group had a better perception of this educational method as measured by perceived enjoyment, increased knowledge of psychopharmacology, and stimulating interest in the subject compared to those in the lecture group (p < 0.05).\nTeaching psychopharmacology in medical students by using academic games can make the learning experience more enjoyable and motivating; however, future studies with higher quality methodology and design are needed to determine the role of educational games in acquiring new psychopharmacological knowledge."}, {"Title": "Serendipity and psychopharmacology.", "Abstract": "This article describes several examples where the development of drugs and devices for use in psychiatry followed from initial serendipitous observations. The potential psychotropic properties of chlorpromazine (Thorazine(\u00ae)) were first noted in surgical patients when the drug was being investigated as a potentiator of anesthesia. Similar findings were noted with iproniazid (Marsilid(\u00ae)), developed for the treatment of tuberculosis, and the drug was later released for clinical use as an antidepressant agent. The development of meprobamate (Miltown(\u00ae)), an approved treatment for anxiety, evolved from initial efforts to find a chemical that would inhibit the enzymatic destruction of the antibiotic drug penicillin. The psychiatric uses of lamotrigine (Lamictal(\u00ae)) and vagus nerve stimulation were prompted by initial observations that epilepsy patients receiving these treatments had positive mood effects.

A 1-hour slide show that covered detailing, prescription tracking, drug samples, medical meetings, and journals was developed by PharmedOut and presented at a total of 14 grand rounds and seminars at departments of family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, psychiatry, cardiology, and neurology. Pre- and posttests included attitudinal and fact questions addressing the influence of drug reps, gifts, pharmaceutical advertising and drug samples on prescribing behavior. The posttest asked whether attendees intended to change their prescribing behavior. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for Likert-scale questions and the Fisher exact test was used to compare the number of pre- and posttest correct answers for the multiple choice and true/false questions. Three hundred seventy-three participants completed pre- and posttests. Significant attitudinal shifts were seen overall, particularly in questions addressing influence of salespeople on physicians in general and on the respondent individually. Some participants commented that they intended to stop seeing drug reps or stop attending industry-funded meals.

Most research into the stigma connected to mental illness was conducted in the developed world. So far, few data exist on countries in sub-Saharan Africa and no data have been published on population attitudes towards mental illness in Ghana. Even less is known about the stigma actually perceived by the mentally ill persons themselves.\nA convenience sample of 403 participants (210 men, mean age 32.4\u00b112.3 years) from urban regions in Accra, Cape Coast and Pantang filled in the Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill (CAMI) questionnaire. In addition, 105 patients (75 men, mean age 35.9\u00b111.0 years) of Ghana's three psychiatric hospitals (Accra Psychiatry Hospital, Ankaful Hospital, Pantang Hospital) answered the Perceived Stigma and Discrimination Scale.\nHigh levels of stigma prevailed in the population as shown by high proportions of assent to items expressing authoritarian and socially restrictive views, coexisting with agreement with more benevolent attitudes. A higher level of education was associated with more positive attitudes on all subscales (Authoritarianism, Social Restrictiveness, Benevolence and Acceptance of Community Based Mental Health Services). The patients reported a high degree of experienced stigma with secrecy concerning the illness as a widespread coping strategy. Perceived stigma was not associated with sex or age.\nThe extent of stigmatising attitudes within the urban population of Southern Ghana is in line with the scant research in other countries in sub-Saharan Africa and mirrored by the experienced stigma reported by the patients. These results have to be seen in the context of the extreme scarcity of resources within the Ghanaian psychiatric system. Anti-stigma efforts should include interventions for mentally ill persons themselves and not exclusively focus on public attitudes."}, {"Title": "Hyperprolactinemia with antipsychotic drugs in children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "There is increasing use of antipsychotic drugs in pediatric and psychiatry practice for a wide range of behavioral and affective disorders. These drugs have prominent side effects of interest to pediatric endocrinologists, including weight gain and associated metabolic risk factors and hyperprolactinemia. The drugs block dopamine action, thus disinhibiting prolactin secretion. Hyperprolactinemia is especially prominent with first-generation antipsychotics such as haloperidol and the second-generation drugs, most commonly risperidone, with some patients developing gynecomastia or galactorrhea or, as a result of prolactin inhibition of gonadotropin releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, amenorrhea. With concern about the long-term effects of antipsychotics on bone mass and pituitary tumor formation, it is prudent to monitor serum prolactin levels in antipsychotic drug-treated pediatric patients and consider treatment with an agent less likely to induce hyperprolactinemia."}, {"Title": "Clinical decisions in psychiatry should not be based on risk assessment.", "Abstract": "Risk assessments that place patients in high or low risk categories have been widely adopted by mental health services in an attempt to reduce the harms associated with psychiatric disorders.

Clinical decisions made on the basis of risk assessment also divert resources away from patients classified as low risk, even though a significant proportion do go on to a commit harmful act. We argue that psychiatric professionals should discuss the risks of treatment and of non-treatment with patients (or with their substitute decision-makers) and should maintain a duty to warn about the consequences of not having treatment. However, assessment of risk of harm should not form the basis for clinical decision making. We should aim to provide optimal care according to the treatment needs of each patient, regardless of the perceived risk of adverse events."}, {"Title": "Shared decision-making: benefits, barriers and current opportunities for application.", "Abstract": "Patient preference and involvement are two important aspects for many psychiatric treatment decisions. Shared decision-making (SDM) has been proposed as the optimal model to include patient preferences and involve patients in such decisions. Decision-making tools called decision aids (DA) are the most common application of SDM. DAs have been demonstrated to increase patients' knowledge, reduce decisional conflict, and reduce the proportion of patients who are passive in the decision-making process or remain undecided. Unfortunately, there are few DAs available for treatment decisions for psychiatric disorders and implementing SDM can be a challenge for mental health professionals. There are also issues unique to psychiatry related to the development and implementation of DAs that need consideration. Despite this, mental health professionals can and do still employ SDM techniques. This article offers an overview of the skills required to implement a SDM model and the resources currently available.\nThe core features of SDM are advocated for in clinical guidelines, but more resources are needed to ensure these recommendations are implemented in practice. In particular, the benefits of freely available DAs developed according to international standards need to be assessed for suitability and effectiveness."}, {"Title": "How shrinks think: decision making in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychiatrists use biopsychosocial models in identifying aetiological factors in assessing their patients and similar approaches in planning management. Models in decision making will be influenced by previous experience, training, age and gender, among other factors. Critical thinking and evidence base are both important components in the process of reaching clinical decisions. Expected outcome of treatment may be another factor. The way we think influences our decision making, clinical or otherwise. With patients expecting and taking larger roles in their own management, there needs to be a shift towards patient-centred care in decision making.\nFurther exploration in how clinical decisions are made by psychiatrists is necessary.

In order to provide stable fundaments for the work in clinical and scientific psychiatry all three components are indispensable.\nThe future of psychiatry hence lies in the hands of a type of psychopathology that we will call Integrative Psychopathology. The main tasks of psychopathology can only be pursued in close cooperation with other branches of science interested in studying psychiatric issues.

Personal suffering, dysfunction and limitations play a central role in pathology and are clearly linked to an inability to change and adapt in a flexible and creative way.

Essentialist kinds are classes whose members share an essence from which their defining features arise. Although elegant and appropriate for some physical (e.g. atomic elements) and medical (e.g. Mendelian disorders) phenomena, this model is inappropriate for psychiatric disorders, which are multi-factorial and 'fuzzy'. Socially constructed kinds are classes whose members are defined by the cultural context in which they arise. This model excludes the importance of shared physiological mechanisms by which the same disorder could be identified across different cultures. Advocates of practical kinds put off metaphysical questions about 'reality' and focus on defining classes that are useful. Practical kinds models for psychiatric disorders, implicit in the DSM nosologies, do not require that diagnoses be grounded in shared causal processes. If psychiatry seeks to tie disorders to etiology and underlying mechanisms, a model first proposed for biological species, mechanistic property cluster (MPC) kinds, can provide a useful framework. MPC kinds are defined not in terms of essences but in terms of complex, mutually reinforcing networks of causal mechanisms. We argue that psychiatric disorders are objectively grounded features of the causal structure of the mind/brain. MPC kinds are fuzzy sets defined by mechanisms at multiple levels that act and interact to produce the key features of the kind. Like species, psychiatric disorders are populations with central paradigmatic and more marginal members. The MPC view is the best current answer to 'What kinds of things are psychiatric disorders?'"}, {"Title": "Pharmacogenomic implications of variants of monoaminergic-related genes in geriatric psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Response to psychiatric medications in later life is highly heterogeneous and complex. Monoaminergic-related polymorphisms may influence medication response and susceptibility to side effects in elderly individuals. Individuals with the lower function short (S) allele of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) insertion/deletion (indel) promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) have both increased the likelihood of adverse drug events and increased the need for higher antidepressant concentrations to obtain maximum antidepressant response. By contrast, carriers of the higher expression homozygous long allele (L/L) genotype may respond at lower concentrations. The differential role of these polymorphisms appears at early stages of treatment rather than in the final antidepressant outcome. Research findings suggest that the rs25531 SNP may influence functional expression of the L allele. Similarly, a variable number of tandem repeats in the second intron of the serotonin transporter gene may influence the expression of SLC6A4 and the implications of these variants may be influenced by aging. Two polymorphisms, rs2242466 (-182T/C) and rs5569 (1287G/A), in the norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2 or NET) have been associated with antidepressant response. Studies in dopamine-related polymorphisms have focused on associations with neuroleptic-induced movement disorders. The rs1800497 variant (Taq1A) of the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) gene located in a noncoding 3\u00b4 region may regulate expression of D2 receptors. The rs6280 variant (Ser9Gly) of the dopamine receptor 3 (DRD3) gene may influence the binding affinity of D3 receptors as a result of serine to glycine substitution of the receptor protein.

It was first described in psychiatry by Otto Kernberg in 1984. There have been few contributions to the literature since that time. We discovered that the syndrome of Malignant Narcissism was expressed in fairy tales as a part of the collective unconscious long before it was recognized by psychiatry. We searched for prominent malignant narcissists in recent history.

There is no structured interview or self-report measure that identifies Malignant Narcissism and this interferes with research, clinical diagnosis and treatment. This paper presents a synthesis of current knowledge about Malignant Narcissism and proposes a foundation for treatment.\nMalignant Narcissism is a severe personality disorder that has devastating consequences for the family and society.

Those with fewer fears about therapy have more positive network orientation, more positive attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help, and more positive opinions about psychiatry so it is more possible for those individuals to visit a mental health service sooner than those with more fears. Reducing the delays in individuals initiating treatment requires clearer understanding of the contributing factors."}, {"Title": "Normative versus consequential ethics in sexually violent predator laws: an ethics conundrum for psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Nineteen states and the federal government have statutes for the civil commitment of sexually violent predators (SVP). The American Psychiatric Association has vigorously opposed SVP laws, citing the abuse of both individual civil rights and of psychiatry in forwarding preventive detention. Those who support the laws underscore that the statutes target highly dangerous sex offenders. There are two different approaches to understanding ethics-based problems and their solutions. The normative approach assumes that there is a universal, intuitive, abstract, correct answer to a given question. However, there is no universal right way to balance the important normative ethic of protecting individual rights with the equally important normative ethic of protecting public safety. A less universal approach, consequential ethics, becomes necessary when abstract normative values conflict and lead to opposing conclusions. In this commentary, we examine and attempt to resolve the conflicting positions raised by the SVP statutes by using consequential versus normative ethics."}, {"Title": "Commentary: The forensic psychiatry of frontotemporal dementia.", "Abstract": "The article by Dr. Mendez is a timely contribution to the literature on the study of antisocial behavior associated with frontotemporal dementia. My commentary is focused on the need to take into account the neuroscientific advances involving frontotemporal dementia and the way in which such information may be conceptually helpful in furthering our understanding of forensic psychiatric cases of individuals with frontotemporal dementia. I place particular emphasis on the need to present basic psychiatric-legal aspects of such cases before we attempt to integrate the relevant neuropsychiatric information. I use the cases presented by Dr. Mendez to highlight this important need in forensic neuropsychiatry. With this commentary, I support the view that both theoretical and practical aspects of neuropsychiatric and forensic psychiatric knowledge must be carefully integrated to achieve effective forensic neuropsychiatric assessments."}, {"Title": "Self-mutilation of tongue and lip in a patient with simple schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Self-inflicted lesions that cause mutilation are observed in schizophrenic patients.

Eligible patients were titrated to aripiprazole (5-30 mg/day) over a 12-week switching phase, during which their previous medication was discontinued. Patients could then enter a 52-week, long-term treatment phase. Aripiprazole was flexibly dosed (5-30 mg/day) at the discretion of the treating physicians. Efficacy was assessed using the Clinical Global Impression scale Improvement (CGI-I) score, the Clinical Global Impression scale Severity (CGI-S) score, The Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS), and the Quality of Life (QOL) scale, as well as Preference of Medicine (POM) ratings by patients and caregivers. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.\nA total of 245 patients were enrolled and switched from their prior antipsychotic medications, and 153 patients entered the 52-week extension phase. In all, 79 patients (32.2%) completed the study. At week 64, the mean CGI-I score was 3.10 and 64.6% of patients who showed response. Compared to baseline, scores of CGI-S, QOL, and BPRS after 64 weeks of treatment also showed significant improvements. At week 12, 65.4% of subjects and 58.9% of caregivers rated aripiprazole as better than the prestudy medication on the POM. The most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) were headache, auditory hallucinations and insomnia. A total of 13 patients (5.3%) discontinued treatment due to AEs. No statistically significant changes were noted with respect to fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile, body weight, and body mass index after long-term treatment with aripiprazole.\nAlthough the discontinuation rate was high, aripiprazole was found to be effective, safe and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of Taiwanese patients with schizophrenia who continued to receive treatment for 64 weeks."}, {"Title": "Adolescence and the reorganization of infant development: a neuro-psychoanalytic model.", "Abstract": "The psychoanalytic view of adolescence as a phase of turbulence and reorganization occupied a central position in child and adolescent psychiatry until about 1980. The view of adolescence as a silent-transition phase then prevailed and diverged from the psychoanalytic perspective. This article reviews infant and adolescent development using an interdisciplinary, neuro-psychoanalytic model in which psychoanalytic, neurobiological, and developmental perspectives converge and complement each other. Recent empirical research focuses attention on adolescence as a phase in which a far-reaching neurobiological and psychological reorganization takes place. According to the ontogenetic principle of psychoanalysis, the development and organization of the basic psychic functions occur in the first five years of life, while a reorganization takes place in adolescence. Neurobiological research confirms that the basic growth and maturation of the brain occurs in the first five years of life, and that a substantial reorganization in brain development transpires in adolescence. Research also verifies the clinical psychoanalytic concept that neurobiological and psychological maturation in adolescence remain unfinished till approximately age 23. The long-term and late biopsychosocial maturation in adolescence implies that adequate monitoring by parents and school remains necessary. The view that adolescents need to separate, and discover their individuality and independence alone, is unsupported by recent findings. The adolescent must acquire his independence, personal identity, and self-agency (\"scaffolding\") step by step. It is important that the adolescent knows that his parents are in the background monitoring and intervening as necessary; that he is not entirely alone, adrift and at risk for potential fragmentation. The long-term plasticity of the brain in adolescence implies greater vulnerability for the development of psychopathology, but offers opportunity for psychotherapeutic interventions to have greater impact."}, {"Title": "Routine outcome monitoring and feedback on physical or mental health status: evidence and theory.", "Abstract": "Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) is an important quality tool for measuring outcome of treatment in health care.

Main search terms were routine outcome monitoring/measurement, feedback, health status measurement, patient reported outcome measures.\nIncluded were 52 RCT's concerning ROM and feedback with adult or older patients: of these seven RCT's were exclusively focused on physical health and 45 RCT's (also) on the mental health of the patient, although not always in a mental health care setting or as primary outcome measure. There appears to be a positive impact of ROM on diagnosis and monitoring of treatment, and on communication between patient and therapist. Other results were less clear. There were no published RCT's on this topic with children or adolescents.\nROM appears especially effective for the monitoring of patients who are not doing well in therapy.

There is also evidence for the contribution of some highly penetrant rare de novo copy number variants, though the lack of disease specificity for these is of concern.

The brain is an extremely intricate physical entity and we have only recently begun to develop the conceptual tools to decipher this complexity. We can begin to comprehend many of the mental functions and dysfunctions by using insights about brain organization as a developing physical entity of connectivity structures. A comprehensive theoretical framework for the re-conceptualization of mental disorders as real brain-disorders, called \"Clinical brain profiling\" can be generated to make testable predictions about the etiopathology of psychiatric disorders. If validated, this framework has groundbreaking relevance for psychiatry, not only by providing an etiological diagnostic system, in itself revolutionary, but in its potential to develop effective curative interventions. According to the proposed brain profiling all mental disturbances can be defined in a 3 dimensional space of brain disturbances (1) neural-complexity organization, (2) to neural resilience optimization dynamics and (3) to connectivity constructs for context and internal representations. Neural complexity relates to the ability of the brain to balance connectivity dynamics, neural resilience relates to brain plasticity and changeability for optimizing overall brain dynamics and contextual configurations shape the internal representations of outer world that pattern out reaction and personality styles. Each of these organizational brain functions is predicted to involve a relatively specific neuronal circuitry system in the brain. The circuitry of the nigra-striautum-cortex, are a component of the connectivity balance stabilizers and regulators, a type of neural complexity pacemaker. Thus a patient that rates high on phenomenology related to functional psychosis indicating a disturbance to connectivity balance will have disturbances that will show up in appropriate signal processing imaging of the nigra-striautum-cortex circuitry. The circuitry of thalamus-amygdala-cortex and related pathways are relevant for neuronal matching and constraint frustration. In this respect the patients scoring high on mood and anxiety disorders are predicted to suffer from perturbation shown on appropriate imaging involving the thalamus-amygdala-cortex circuitries. The hippocampus is related to the formation of internal configurations thus those patients rating highest on parameters related to personality organization and maturation will show alterations in the hippocampal organization and activation indicating deficient organizations of internal configurations."}, {"Title": "Environmental toxicology and risk assessment of pharmaceuticals from hospital wastewater.", "Abstract": "In this paper, we evaluated the ecotoxicological potential of the 100 pharmaceuticals expected to occur in highest quantities in the wastewater of a general hospital and a psychiatric center in Switzerland. We related the toxicity data to predicted concentrations in different wastewater streams to assess the overall risk potential for different scenarios, including conventional biological pretreatment in the hospital and urine source separation. The concentrations in wastewater were estimated with pharmaceutical usage information provided by the hospitals and literature data on human excretion into feces and urine. Environmental concentrations in the effluents of the exposure scenarios were predicted by estimating dilution in sewers and with literature data on elimination during wastewater treatment. Effect assessment was performed using quantitative structure-activity relationships because experimental ecotoxicity data were only available for less than 20% of the 100 pharmaceuticals with expected highest loads. As many pharmaceuticals are acids or bases, a correction for the speciation was implemented in the toxicity prediction model. The lists of Top-100 pharmaceuticals were distinctly different between the two hospital types with only 37 pharmaceuticals overlapping in both datasets. 31 Pharmaceuticals in the general hospital and 42 pharmaceuticals in the psychiatric center had a risk quotient above 0.01 and thus contributed to the mixture risk quotient. However, together they constituted only 14% (hospital) and 30% (psychiatry) of the load of pharmaceuticals. Hence, medical consumption data alone are insufficient predictors of environmental risk. The risk quotients were dominated by amiodarone, ritonavir, clotrimazole, and diclofenac. Only diclofenac is well researched in ecotoxicology, while amiodarone, ritonavir, and clotrimazole have no or very limited experimental fate or toxicity data available. The presented computational analysis thus helps setting priorities for further testing. Separate treatment of hospital wastewater would reduce the pharmaceutical load of wastewater treatment plants, and the risk from the newly identified priority pharmaceuticals. However, because high-risk pharmaceuticals are excreted mainly with feces, urine source separation is not a viable option for reducing the risk potential from hospital wastewater, while a sorption step could be beneficial."}, {"Title": "Psychopharmacology: a house divided.", "Abstract": "Psychopharmacology and psychiatry during the past 50 years have focused on the specificity model in which it is assumed that psychiatric disorders are specific entities which should respond to drugs with specific mechanisms of action. However, the validity of this model has been challenged by the approval of multiple drugs for the same disorder, as well as the approval of single agents for a variety of disorders which have little in common. As an example of this unacknowledged paradigm shift, I will examine the foundation for using antipsychotics in the treatment of depression.\nAn extensive literature search of studies investigating various mechanisms of actions of antipsychotics and antidepressants with the goal of identifying neurochemical processes common to both.\nThe neurochemical differences in these classes of drugs appear to be profound, although several processes are common in both, including some degree of neuroprotection and changes in the epigenome.

There is now a body of literature suggesting that violence towards psychiatrists is more common than to other doctors. Thus far the vast majority of research in this area has been conducted in Western European and North American clinical settings. For the first time, this study examines this issue in the context of Turkish psychiatric settings.\n(i) The study aims to detect the prevalence of verbal and physical assaults towards psychiatrists in Turkey. (ii) It aims to compare the experience of verbal and physical assaults according to the gender and training experience of psychiatrists. (iii) The paper intends to investigate how psychiatrists reacted to and appraised the experience of violence.\nA questionnaire was prepared to evaluate violence towards psychiatrists (adapted from the Overt Agression Scale). The questionaire was administered to psychiatric specialists and residents working in state hospitals, research and training hospitals, mental health hospitals and university psychiatry clinics. A response rate of 93% was achieved with 186 out of 200 psychiatrsits approached completing the study questionnaire.\nOf all the psychiatrists who responded, 71% reported having experienced verbal or physical assaults during their professional life (verbal assaults only (19.9%), physical assaults only (2.7%) and both (48.4%)). Of these, 26% suffered injury to at least a mild degree. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of gender and workplace. In spite of the extremely high rates of aggression and violence towards psychiatrists, roughly 50% perceived these acts a normal part of their job and only 5% formally reported the violent incident.\nThe majority of psychiatrists described having been victims of verbal and physical assaults although half perceived aggression and violence as a normal part of their job. Levels of reporting of violence were very low in the context of this study. Studies such as this provide evidence to inform the development of improved management of violence and may encourage psychiatrists to report violence."}, {"Title": "[Practical study for seminar program certified by Japanese Society of Hospital Pharmacists for Clinical Psychiatric Pharmacists organized by Chiba Society of Hospital Pharmacists, and investigation of participants' background and issues for taking board certified psychiatric pharmacy specialists and board certified pharmacists in psychiatric pharmacy certifications using questionnaires].", "Abstract": "Recently, certification systems for Board-Certified Psychiatric Pharmacy Specialists (BCPPS) and Board-Certified Pharmacists in Psychiatric Pharmacy (BCPPP) were established by the Japanese Society of Hospital Pharmacists (JSHP) in 2008, to meet the increasing needs for specialists in psychiatric pharmacy. However, there was no report on the background and opinion of pharmacists who have intention to take the BCPPS or BCPPP and/or seminar programs for BCPPS or BCPPP. The Chiba Society of Hospital Pharmacists has started to provide a seminar program certified by the JSHP to study psychiatry for pharmacists and also investigated the participants' background, demand for the program, and issues in taking the BCPPS or BCPPP using questionnaires. We found that many participants wanted lectures to obtain information on issues they face in routine work as well as for certification testing. For many participants, satisfying the requirements for applying for the BCPPS or BCPPP was one of the most important issues in receiving the qualifications. We found that over 40% of participants working at community pharmacies intended to take the BCPPS or BCPPP, although working experience at a community pharmacy does not entitle them to apply for the BCPPS or BCPPP.

For this purpose a literature search was conducted via-internet based search engines, including Pubmed, Science Direct, Medline, Psychinfo, the ULAKBIM Turkish Medicine Index and the Turkish Psychiatry Index, using the keywords containment methods, psychiatry, aggression, conflict, restraint, seclusion and mental health hospitals, in different combinations.\nAccording to the literature, professional containment methods are defined as methods used to prevent harm to patients or others as a result of the patient's conflict-provoking behaviour (aggression, absconding, rule breaking, refusing medication etc.) in psychiatric wards. These methods include the use of mechanical/physical restraint, seclusion, compulsory intramuscular sedation, observation, and pro re nata (prn) medication. The type and frequency of use, views or attitudes to methods varies between different countries.\nAlthough professional containment methods are an effective management strategy, they may cause physical and psychological damage to both patient and staff. So the use of these methods in psychiatric care settings remains controversial and an ongoing source of legal and ethical dilemmas. Despite discussions, the containment methods used in the past remain present as a part of psychiatric treatment and care. There is a need for standard practice guidelines to ensure the security of patients and staff and to use those methods effectively and correctly.

Pre-clinical and clinical training schedules varied between medical schools. In all, 3 of the medical schools did not offer internships in psychiatry. The majority of chairs emphasized the importance of mood disorders (49.9%) and anxiety disorders (40%), suggesting that these disorders should be treated by general practitioners. Computer technology was commonly used for lecturing; however, utilization of interactive and skill-based teaching methods was limited. The most commonly used evaluation methods were written examination (87.5%) during preclinical training and oral examination (91.6%) during clinical training.\nThe most important finding of this study was the lack of a standardized curriculum for psychiatric training in Turkey.

Structural abnormalities in the brain, such as white matter hyperintensities, medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), or global cortical atrophy, may influence therapeutic response. The respective value of these factors in response prediction is unclear.\nIn a naturalistic clinical cohort of 81 elderly patients diagnosed with DSM-IV major depressive disorder, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was recorded and rated before ECT treatment. The study was conducted at the clinic for Geriatric Psychiatry of the VU University Medical Center/Stichting Buitenamstel Geestgronden, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, over a 5-year period (2001-2006). Severity of depressive symptoms was measured by using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Response to ECT was defined as a decrease of at least 50 percent on the MADRS, and remission was defined as a score below 10 points on the MADRS.\nPatients with moderate or severe MTA had a lower mean percentage decrease in MADRS scores after ECT (37.9% in those with MTA, compared to 66.2% in those without MTA, P = .008). Patients without MTA had a 3 times greater chance of remitting from their depression compared to patients with moderate or severe MTA, ie, the hazard ratio for remission was 3.22 (95% CI, 1.30 to 7.69, P = .01). In contrast, no differences in change in MADRS scores were found for white matter hyperintensities or global cortical atrophy.\nMedial temporal lobe atrophy--not white matter hyperintensities or global cortical atrophy--contributes to poor response to ECT in severely depressed elderly patients. These findings suggest that assessment of MTA in severely depressed elderly patients may be useful in the prediction of potential ECT response."}, {"Title": "European consensus statement on diagnosis and treatment of adult ADHD: The European Network Adult ADHD.", "Abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the most common psychiatric disorders of childhood that persists into adulthood in the majority of cases.

Text messaging was found to be particularly well suited for young people who have to travel to the outpatient clinic over long distances or who face the risk of social exclusion. According to clinicians, the text message reminders sent between the visits, which take place every 1-2 months, can encourage the young people in question to stay in touch more frequently, which will help to improve their relationship with the hospital staff. The project is still in the pilot stage, and so far the most important results concern the development of the operating culture and, surprisingly enough, legal aspects. From the legal point of view, the hospital had to equate text messages with phone communications. For this reason, it was not possible to put the text messages into a separate register and they have not been archived either.

The techniques used range from descriptive statistics to multivariate analysis (correspondence analysis and multiple ascending hierarchical classification).\nThe images of the \"madness\", the \"mentally ill\" or the \"depression\" in the French population are disparate. Nevertheless, some characteristics are found with high frequency: the \"depressive\" is rather seen as an isolated person, the \"mentally ill\" as a mental defective with bizarre speech, while \"crazy\" would rather characterized by violence (delusions and violent towards others, beat his family, incest). The \"mentally ill\" is sometimes defined by these last criteria. These images are not influenced by knowledge of a relative suffering from mental illness or a psychiatric episode experienced by the interviewee. The causes of mental illness (the \"madness\" and \"mentally ill\"), two contradictory trends have expressed. Some believe it has a physical origin, and in that case the healing is difficult and care must be hospitable. Others believe it was originally a non-physical (social), and in this case, recovery is possible, and care must be ambulatory. People surveyed in some sites have homogeneous opinions in this regard: Berk, Thuir or Gu\u00e9ret, the first opinion is mainly expressed, whereas the opposite trend was observed in Villejuif, Niort, Lille, Poitiers, Paris15, Paris10. In contrast, for depression, the cause is, for almost the entire population, non-physical. Overall, 41% of French people support psychiatric hospitals, while 32% oppose, preferring ambulatory solutions. In fact, opinions differ so widely among survey sites. They are not influenced by the images of people surveyed vis-\u00e0-vis the \"madness\", the \"mentally ill\" or the \"depression\". The way of organizing psychiatric sectorization (taken care rather intra-hospital versus extra-hospital, number of agents, etc.) does not influence either the image of \"mad\", the \"mentally ill\" or \"depression\" in population, nor the opinions vis-\u00e0-vis psychiatric hospitals.

To assess the ability of mental health professionals to use the 4-item Negative Symptom Assessment instrument, derived from the Negative Symptom Assessment-16, to rapidly determine the severity of negative symptoms of schizophrenia.Design. Open participation.Setting. Medical education conferences.Participants. Attendees at two international psychiatry conferences.Measurements. Participants read a brief set of the 4-item Negative Symptom Assessment instructions and viewed a videotape of a patient with schizophrenia. Using the 1 to 6 4-item Negative Symptom Assessment severity rating scale, they rated four negative symptom items and the overall global negative symptoms. These ratings were compared with a consensus rating determination using frequency distributions and Chi-square tests for the proportion of participant ratings that were within one point of the expert rating.Results. More than 400 medical professionals (293 physicians, 50% with a European practice, and 55% who reported past utilization of schizophrenia ratings scales) participated. Between 82.1 and 91.1 percent of the 4-items and the global rating determinations by the participants were within one rating point of the consensus expert ratings. The differences between the percentage of participant rating scores that were within one point versus the percentage that were greater than one point different from those by the consensus experts was significant (p<0.0001). Participants rating of negative symptoms using the 4-item Negative Symptom Assessment did not generally differ among the geographic regions of practice, the professional credentialing, or their familiarity with the use of schizophrenia symptom rating instruments.Conclusion. These findings suggest that clinicians from a variety of geographic practices can, after brief training, use the 4-item Negative Symptom Assessment effectively to rapidly assess negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Response rate of lorazepam in catatonia: a developing country's perspective.", "Abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome characterized by concurrent motor, emotional, and behavioral symptoms. Short-term benzodiazepine administration and electroconvulsive therapy have proven to be safe and useful for treatment of this syndrome.\nThis study aimed to explore the evidence of effectiveness of lorazepam as a first line treatment for catatonia in a tertiary psychiatry centre in India given the lack of facilities for ECT in primary care centers of developing countries. We examined the response rate of lorazepam in Catatonia.\nClinical charts of 107 inpatients, admitted over a duration of two years, with a primary diagnosis of catatonia were examined for response with lorazepam trial. Trial was considered as having received 3-6 mg per day of lorazepam for at least 3 days.\nAmong the patients who were given lorazepam treatment, 32 out of 99 (32.3%) showed response (with complete resolution of catatonic symptoms). Improvement in catatonic symptoms was seen in 68 out of 99 (68.7%) patients.\nLorazepam is cost effective and could rapidly relieve catatonic signs, even without the use of ECT in a significant proportion of catatonic patients.

Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) present a serious, ever increasing clinical problem. Previous studies identified DDIs among psychiatric inpatients prescribed psychotropics, but none have focused on psychotropics prescribed to General Hospital inpatients. This study aimed to identify: putative drug-drug interactions; mechanisms; potential seriousness among patients prescribed psychotropes in both psychiatric and general hospital inpatients settings. We hypothesised that potential interactions per person would be greater in General Hospital inpatients on psychotropics, due to polypharmacy. Method. We surveyed psychotropic prescribing in hospital wards in a public sector mental health organisation and a 500-bed general hospital. Ward pharmacists collected drug prescription data. A computer based protocol evaluated DDIs. Results. A total of 7.4% of General Hospital inpatients and 100% of Psychiatric Unit inpatients surveyed were prescribed psychotropic medication. The General Hospital group had significantly more potential interactions per person (3.0) than Psychiatric inpatients (1.3) (P<0.05). There were significantly more potentially serious interactions in the general hospital group (P<0.025). Conclusions. DDIs affect those prescribed psychotropics in both General and Psychiatric Hospitals. The General Hospital patients had a higher number per person and more serious potential interactions, yet are often poorly served by psychiatric services, suggesting that liaison psychiatrists have a role in physician education and DDI assessment."}, {"Title": "Dementia services in Canada.", "Abstract": "Canadians with dementia have access to Medicare, a universal, single payer healthcare program.

Existing studies of Hispanics have focused on Mexicans and Mexican-Americans. The goal of the study was to identify the CYP2D6 alleles associated with reduced or negligible activities present in the Puerto Rican population.\nThe study cohort comprised 40 Puerto Rican psychiatric patients referred because of suspected intolerance of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6, and five subjects without suspected adverse responses to these drugs. All subjects had both parents and all grandparents born in Puerto Rico. Genomic DNA was queried for 27 CYP2D6 alleles using the Roche AmpliChip P450 test.\nA total of 12 alleles were identified. The most common alleles were CYP2D6*1 > *2 > *4 > *41. The inactive alleles were *4 > * 5 > * 31 >*40; reduced activity alleles were *10 >* 17 > *9* = *29; active alleles were *1 > *2 > *35. Two subjects carried the rare *31 allele. Only one subject carried two non-functional alleles (CYP2D6*5/*40), and was predicted to be a poor metabolizer.\nAny conclusions should be interpreted with caution given the small population sample investigated. Nonetheless, our findings strongly suggest that Puerto Ricans exhibit distinct CYP2D6 allele frequencies and harbor a non-functional allele that is rare or absent in other populations and are highly valuable for the emerging practice of Personalized Medicine in admixed populations like Puerto Ricans."}, {"Title": "The Severe Impairment Battery predicts functional abilities in an inpatient geriatric population.", "Abstract": "There is limited research examining the relationship between cognition in severe dementia and functional skills.

The aim of our study was to examine this disturbance by exploring in detail how autism and perplexity are experienced subjectively.\nIt is a qualitative single-case study. In order to fully examine our patient's experiences within the context of his experiential world and not only as isolated or decontextualized symptoms, we applied a heideggerian framework, i.e. Heidegger's exhaustive account of the self-world relation (care).\nThrough the framework of care, we discovered a profound disturbance of the self-world relation in our patient, characterized by subtle experiences of estrangement, anxiety and exposure. We found these experiences to be enduring, pervasive and generative for the development of other symptoms.\nWe argue that these experiences can be seen as experiential correlates of schizotypy and of vulnerability to schizophrenia, and furthermore that an understanding of these experiences can play a role in diagnostic and differential diagnostic procedures, e.g. in early detection or in the search for high-risk individuals, as well as in the psychotherapy of schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Helmut Rennert's universal genesis of endogenous psychoses: the historical concept and its significance for today's discussion on unitary psychosis.", "Abstract": "Next to Karl Leonhard (1904-1988), Helmut Rennert (1920-1994) was the internationally best known representative of psychiatry from the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). He rose to prominence above all through his model of the universal genesis of endogenous psychoses, which constituted an antithesis to Leonhard's differentiated division. The 'polar opposite' aspects of Rennert and Leonhard are represented with an emphasis on their contrasting views of psychiatric nosology. In this respect, Rennert's model conceptions constitute the primary focus of attention. The fact that both concepts continue to possess topical perspectives to this day is reflected in the current discussion regarding nosological, categorical, syndromatological and dimensional approaches in relation to the further development of the classification systems of mental disorders. The preparatory work on the future classification systems will potentially omit the dichotomy between schizophrenic and affective disorders. These endeavors are in accordance with Rennert's unitarian psychopathological view and support his acceptance of the psychopathological continuity from affective to schizophrenic syndromes. The current discussion concerning the future classification is in line with Rennert, whose aim was to provide an unconventional model that unites findings from the different fields of psychiatric research. The classification of mental disorders without a previous establishment on the basis of fundamental theoretical assumptions could certainly foster a dynamic development in the future. A differentiated knowledge of the history of the ideas of unitary psychosis and their further development might be helpful in this development and can be of particular use when critically questioning explanatory approaches that are prone to simplification."}, {"Title": "[Psychotropic treatment of psychodermatologic disorders].", "Abstract": "Psychotropic drugs act by correcting the chemical changes associated with mental disorders and their symptoms.

Data on concurrent validity have accumulated, but predictive validity is limited. Predictive validity is critical to refuting the hypothesis that diagnosing ODD and CD in young children leads to pathologizing normal behavior. ODD and CD have emerged as gateway disorders to many forms of adult psychopathology. Establishing how early we can identify symptoms and disorders that herald poor prognosis is one of the most important goals for research on etiology and prevention.\nSubjects were 3-5-year-old consecutive referrals to a child psychiatry clinic (n=123) and demographically matched children from a pediatric clinic (n=100). A diagnostic interview was used to assess DSM-IV ODD and CD in a prospective follow-up design from preschool to school age. Stability of ODD and CD diagnoses and level of impairment were tested as a function of preschool diagnosis.\nOver 80% of preschoolers diagnosed with ODD and approximately 60% of preschoolers diagnosed with CD met criteria for the same disorder during follow-up. Impairment over time varied significantly as a function of stability of diagnosis across three years.\nThese results provide the first evidence of the predictive validity of DSM-IV ODD and CD in clinically referred preschool children.

The response rate was 54%. Most physicians met with PRs (98%), received drug samples (85%) and stationery (96%), and participated in industry-sponsored continuing medical education (CME) events at the workplace (80%) and outside the workplace (93%). Half accepted meals outside the workplace (49%) and financial subsidies to attend CME events (49%). Rules at the workplace banning both meetings with PRs and gifts predicted less involvement of physicians in promotional activities. Physicians valued information from PRs. They believed that they were unlikely to be influenced by promotional activities, but that their colleagues were more susceptible to such influence than themselves. They were divided about the appropriateness of low-value gifts. The extent of physician involvement in promotional activities was positively correlated with the attitudes that PRs are a valuable source of information and that gifts are appropriate. The extent of such involvement was higher among physicians who prefer to ask PRs for information when a new medication becomes available, physicians who are not satisfied with patient encounters ending only with advice, and physicians who prefer to prescribe brand-name medications.\nInvolvement in pharmaceutical promotional activities is widespread among practicing physicians in Japan. The extent of such involvement varies according to certain physician characteristics. As a group, they are at risk for influence by promotional activities."}, {"Title": "Synchronous work: myth or reality? A critical study of teams in health and medical care.", "Abstract": "In this article, ideal conceptions about teamwork are tested. The research question posed is: How are teams in psychiatry formed? Three theoretical concepts that distinguish groups from teams are presented: sequentiality, parallelism and synchronicity. The presumption is that groups cooperate sequentially and teams synchronously, while the parallel work mode is a transitional form between group and team.\nThree psychiatric outpatient teams at a university hospital specialist clinic were studied. Data were collected through 25 personal interviews and 82 hours of observations. The data collection was carried out over 18 months (2008-2009).\nResults show: (1) that the three theoretical distinctions between group and team need to be supplemented with two intermediate forms, semiparallel and semisynchronous teamwork; and (2) that teamwork is not characterized by striving towards a synchronous ideal but instead is marked by an adaptive interaction between sequential, parallel and synchronous working modes.\nThe article points to a new intermediate stage between group and team. This intermediate stage is called semiparallel teamwork. The study shows that practical teamwork is not characterized by a synchronous ideal, but rather is about how to adaptively find acceptable solutions to a series of practical problems. The study emphasizes the importance of the team varying between different working modes, so-called semisystematics."}, {"Title": "Pediatrician-psychiatrist collaboration to care for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, and anxiety.", "Abstract": "To describe pediatrician experiences collaborating with psychiatrists when caring for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and anxiety.\nA random sample of Massachusetts primary care pediatricians completed a mailed self-report survey.\nResponse rate was 50% (100/198).

This process is reflected in the numerous case report publications as well as in debates taking place at the Lisbon Society of Medical Sciences, the major scientific forum of that time. The 'Ajuda Paralyses' were a mysterious succession of epidemics that occurred during 1860-64 in the Ajuda asylum for cholera and yellow fever orphans, which were extensively discussed during 1865-66 by Bernardino Antonio Gomes, Antonio Maria Barbosa, Abel Jord\u00e3o and Eduardo Motta. Studying this debate helps understand the initial stages of development and the great interest that 'nervous diseases' had for Portuguese clinicians in the mid-19th century and possibly provides one of the first modern descriptions of nutrition-related polyradiculoneuropathy and the ocular findings associated with avitaminosis A. This debate took place at a decisive time for the scientific development of neurology and psychiatry, concurrent with the widespread application of the clinical-anatomical method and neuropathology to the study of diseases of the nervous system, which would set the foundations for our own modern pathophysiological framework. Therefore, the 'Ajuda paralyses' debate also provides a good basis for a discussion on the evolution of the concepts of hysteria and psychosomatic disease and the description of peripheral neuropathy from among a wealth of other entities that did not withstand the test of science."}, {"Title": "[Psychosomatic approach to patients with headache: alternative or integrated diagnoses?].", "Abstract": "Each person has an inseparable body-mind unity, with psychic factors that can also manifest themselves through changes in the functions of the body, and with changing somatic states that contribute to mental experience. This explains why somatic symptoms fall within psychiatry. When a patient complains about physical symptoms, it is essentially an integrated, multidisciplinary diagnosis which is used to identify the various factors (biological and psychological) which worsen the disorder, and a psychiatric dimensional approach is used to integrate the descriptive symptomatic diagnosis with the psychostructural diagnosis. The same symptoms, in fact, may underlie different psychological dynamics that direct the treatment and determine the prognosis, as explained in three clinical cases that we described. The literature on headaches reports a high rate of co-morbidity between migraines and psychiatric disorders, but doesn't take into account the fact that often the symptom of headache is part of the disorder, even when it presents on its own. In conclusion, a holistic approach is needed for the patient to be diagnosed as having a \"psychiatric\" form of headache. A medical examination of the illness leading to a diagnoses is essential, according to the criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disease (ICHD-II). In clinical practice, we have integrated the descriptive diagnosis (ICHD-II mini-Plus) with the psychological (Diagnostic Criteria of Psychosomatic Research - DCPR) and psycho-structural (Kenberg's interview, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory - MMPI) diagnoses. The clarification of the dynamics underlying the definition of symptoms and the role played by psychological factors has influenced the identification of therapeutic objectives and in the identification of the most appropriate strategies."}, {"Title": "Shell shock, trauma, and the First World War: the making of a diagnosis and its histories.", "Abstract": "During the First World War, thousands of soldiers were treated for \"shell shock,\" a condition which encompassed a range of physical and psychological symptoms. Shell shock has most often been located within a \"genealogy of trauma,\" and identified as an important marker in the gradual recognition of the psychological afflictions caused by combat. In recent years, shell shock has increasingly been viewed as a powerful emblem of the suffering of war. This article, which focuses on Britain, extends scholarly analyses which question characterizations of shell shock as an early form of post-traumatic stress disorder. It also considers some of the methodological problems raised by recasting shell shock as a wartime medical construction rather than an essentially timeless manifestation of trauma. It argues that shell shock must be analyzed as a diagnosis shaped by a specific set of contemporary concerns, knowledges, and practices. Such an analysis challenges accepted understandings of what shell shock \"meant\" in the First World War, and also offers new perspectives on the role of shell shock in shaping the emergence of psychology and psychiatry in the early part of the twentieth century. The article also considers what relation, if any, might exist between intellectual and other histories, literary approaches, and perceptions of trauma as timeless and unchanging."}, {"Title": "The Br\u00f8set Violence Checklist: clinical utility in a secure psychiatric intensive care setting.", "Abstract": "Violence towards health-care workers, especially in areas such as mental health/psychiatry, has become increasingly common, with nursing staff suggesting that a fear of violence from their patients may affect the quality of care they provide. Structured clinical tools have the potential to assist health-care providers in identifying patients who have the potential to become violent or aggressive. The Br\u00f8set Violence Checklist (BVC), a six-item instrument that uses the presence or absence of three patient characteristics and three patient behaviours to predict the potential for violence within a subsequent 24-h period, was trialled for 3 months on an 11-bed secure psychiatric intensive care unit. Despite the belief on the part of some nurses that decisions related to risk for violence and aggression rely heavily on intuition, there was widespread acceptance of the tool.

The observed shift is described as the development of psychiatry as a function system of modern society and whose operative goal has moved from the medical and social management of a lower and marginalized group to the specialized medical and psychological care of the whole population. From this theoretical viewpoint, the wider deployment of the modern social order as a functionally differentiated system may be considered to be a consistent driving force for this process; it has made asylum psychiatry overly incompatible with prevailing social values (particularly with the normative and regulative principle of inclusion of all individuals in the different functional spheres of society and with the common patterns of participation in modern function systems) and has, in turn, required the availability of psychiatric care for a growing number of individuals. After presenting this account, some major challenges for the future of mental health care provision, such as the overburdening of services or the overt exclusion of a significant group of potential users, are identified and briefly discussed."}, {"Title": "How much can we learn about missing data?: an exploration of a clinical trial in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "When a randomized controlled trial has missing outcome data, any analysis is based on untestable assumptions, e.g. that the data are missing at random, or less commonly on other assumptions about the missing data mechanism. Given such assumptions, there is an extensive literature on suitable methods of analysis. However, little is known about what assumptions are appropriate. We use two sources of ancillary data to explore the missing data mechanism in a trial of adherence therapy in patients with schizophrenia: carer-reported (proxy) outcomes and the number of contact attempts. This requires additional assumptions to be made whose plausibility we discuss. Proxy outcomes are found to be unhelpful in this trial because they are insufficiently associated with patient outcome and because the ancillary assumptions are implausible. The number of attempts required to achieve a follow-up interview is helpful and suggests that these data are unlikely to depart far from being missing at random. We also perform sensitivity analyses to departures from missingness at random, based on the investigators' prior beliefs elicited at the start of the trial.

The corresponding data was analysed retrospectively with Chi-Square statistics and paired T-Tests.\nThe distance between patients' residence and the psychiatric institution was reduced significantly by 73\u200a%. Compulsory admission decreased overall by 10\u200a%, with affective disorders showing the most explicit reduction (28\u200a%). Regarding patient's contentment with the clinical treatment, there was a considerable increase. The degree of illness severity at the patient's admission was higher in Winterthur than in Rheinau.\nThe results indicate that relocation of the acute care units from a rural to an urban area has enhanced community based psychiatry (shorter distance) as well as low-threshold psychiatry (lower rate of compulsory admission, increase in patient's contentment). Nevertheless, there is a major limitation regarding the present study: the two concepts community based psychiatry and low-threshold psychiatry have been operationalised retrospectively. Further prospective empirical evaluations are needed to disclose the relation between community based psychiatry and low-threshold psychiatry."}, {"Title": "We're the Same... but Different: Addressing Academic Divides in the Study of Brain and Behavior.", "Abstract": "How the brain mediates behavior is a question relevant to a broad range of disciplines including evolutionary biology, basic neuroscience, psychiatry, and population health. Experiments in animals have traditionally used two distinct approaches to explore brain-behavior relationships; one uses naturally existing behavioral models while the other focuses on the creation and investigation of medically oriented models using existing laboratory-amenable organisms. Scientists using the first approach are often referred to and self identify as \"neuroethologists,\" while the second category spans a variety of other sub-disciplines but is often referred to broadly as \"behavioral neuroscience.\" Despite an overall common scientific goal - the elucidation of the neural basis of behavior - members of these two groups often come from different scientific lineages, seek different sources of funding, and make their homes in different departments or colleges. The separation of these groups is also fostered by their attendance at different scientific conferences and publication records that reflect different journal preferences. Bridging this divide represents an opportunity to explore previously unanswerable questions and foster rapid scientific advances. This article explores the reasons for this divide and proposes measures that could help increase technology transfer and communication between these groups, potentially overcoming both physical and ideological gaps."}, {"Title": "The value of social attributes of stimuli for promoting engagement in persons with dementia.", "Abstract": "The present study examined the impact of different attributes of social stimuli using the stimulus attributes aspect of the Comprehensive Process Model of Engagement ( Am J Geriatr Psychiatry. 17:299-307). Participants were 193 residents of 7 Maryland nursing homes with a diagnosis of dementia. Stimuli were chosen to represent different levels of the following social attributes: social versus not social, realistic versus not realistic, animated versus nonanimated, human versus nonhuman, and alive versus not alive. Participants had significantly longer engagement, were significantly more attentive, and displayed a significantly more positive attitude with social stimuli than with nonsocial stimuli. Longer durations and higher ratings of attention and attitude were seen with realistic and animated stimuli as compared to their counterparts. Human and live stimuli resulted in significantly more engagement than their counterparts. Giving any social stimulus to the residents is preferable to providing none, and the social attributes of stimuli should be maximized."}, {"Title": "[Psychological events--organic interpretations: concepts of trauma in German psychiatry since 1889].", "Abstract": "This paper examines the debate on psychological trauma in German psychiatry since 1889. A content analysis of five leading German psychiatric journals between 1889 and 2005 is realised. An organic concept of psychological trauma has been prominent in the professional debate until today. Psychiatrists frequently referred to physical traumatisation, constitutional factors and genetic predisposition, exogenous reaction types according to Bonhoeffer, and to biological markers in the context of the PTSD concept. The biological tradition in German psychiatry resulted in a specific adoption of concepts on psychological trauma. However, integrating various models of psychological trauma into a psychiatric tradition focusing on a biological model proved to be difficult and inconsistent."}, {"Title": "[A multi-centre study of the reliability, validity and sensitivity to change of the honos65+ in psychiatry for older persons].", "Abstract": "Within the mental health care services for older persons there is a growing need for insight into and evaluation of the results of clinical treatment.

This assumption contrasts with the psychiatric orthodoxy of the First World War when it was concluded in both Britain and Germany that POWs were protected against 'war neurosis'. Although 'barbed wire disease' was identified during time of captivity, post-release effects were not recognized. The repatriation of 'protected' POWs in 1943 prompted a reassessment of the psychological impact of imprisonment when servicemen of previous good character began to behave aberrantly. Rehabilitation programmes were designed to enable soldiers to re-adapt to service or civilian roles. Difficulties of adjustment were cast in social and cognitive terms, and corrective measures were occupational and educational. Psychiatric disorders found in POWs were explained in terms of a pre-conflict predisposition to, or a history of, mental illness. However, retrospective studies of veteran POWs have found a high prevalence of PTSD. A change in attitudes is explored in relation to the advance of medical terminology into the territory of emotions and the attribution of pathological processes to self-recovering mental states. The reclassification of the effects of imprisonment implies that diagnoses in military psychiatry are culturally determined and can be understood only if they are placed in a context that includes changing beliefs about mental illness, the formal development of the psychiatric profession and the immediate needs of the armed forces."}, {"Title": "[Adolescence and psychopathy].", "Abstract": "Personality disorder refers to pervasive and inflexible behaviour causing problems in everyday life.

Although early research on the efficacy of these approaches has yielded mixed results, this new strategy offers tremendous potential to provide empirically supported therapies to many individuals who would never access psychiatric care, to extend the time and expertise of clinicians, and to offer improved care and monitoring. However, the great promise of computer-assisted therapies may be diminished if their benefits are overstated or if they are broadly released or disseminated before being carefully evaluated using the same methodologic standards that are requirements for evaluating clinician-delivered therapies.

In my opinion the objections made by Stone on the feasibility of forensic psychiatry in the courts continue in full force, to the extent that these objections are the heart of the debate about the theoretical orientation of the DSM-5.\nThe advocates of the standard position have an overly optimistic view of the capacity of objectification of forensic psychiatry.

Where possible, one-year follow-up was arranged.\n173 persons aged 65 years or more were referred to the service during the ten years and assessed as living in squalor (120 moderate or severe, two thirds of whom showed a moderate or severe degree of hoarding/clutter).

The annual new referral rate was close to 1 per 1000 elderly people in the catchment area, and of moderate or severe squalor was 0.66 per 1000. Limiting follow-up to those in moderate or severe squalor, 41% were still at home one year later. Current findings suggest that the minimum prevalence in the community of older people living in moderate or severe squalor in Sydney is 1 per 1000.\nThe costs of intervening in cases of severe domestic squalor are considerable.

Medical students' attitude toward psychiatry has been pointed as a predictor of recruitment. This study aims to evaluate the medical students' perception of psychiatry before and after a clerkship, and the impact on their intention to pursue psychiatry as a future specialty option.\nTwo self-report questionnaires were administered to all 6th year students in a medical school in Lisbon, before and after a 4-weeks full-time psychiatric clerkship, in order to evaluate attitudes toward psychiatry and intention to follow psychiatry in the future. Statistical analysis included Wilcoxon and Chi-square tests.\n153 students (60.8% female) filled in both questionnaires (no dropouts). After the clerkship, there was a significant improvement regarding the overall merits of psychiatry, efficacy, role definition and functioning of psychiatrists, use of legal powers to hospitalize patients and specific medical school factors. There was also a significant increase of students decided or considering the possibility to take a residency in psychiatry.However, perceptions of low prestige and negative pressure from family and peers regarding a future choice of psychiatry remained unchanged in about one-third of the students.\nThe results indicate clearly that the clerkship had a favorable overall impact on the student attitude towards psychiatry, as well as in the number of students considering a future career in psychiatry.

Responders from psychiatry most often complain about in-patient specifics; from neurology about the stay conditions. Comparison of patients' opinions from psychiatry in 2005 and 2007 year indicates stability of positive opinions in majority of areas; the second study shows the essential growth of positive opinions in neurological wards. In both groups, satisfaction regarding information accessibility, form of contact with staff (less satisfying in neurological wards) and emotional support is still too low. Persons' percentage confirming emotional support from staff is higher in psychiatric wards than neurological ones in both studies.\nStaff friendliness plays a very important role during the hospitalisation. Both groups indicate dimensions requiring improvement: access to information, form of contact with staff, emotional support. The resultsindicate a contrast between the system of support on psychiatric wards and lack of this on the neurological ones. The neurological wards can use psychiatric ward positive experience regarding patients' emotional support received from nurses and the building staff patients relationship based on ideas of the therapeutic community.

According to this the postulate of freedom is its strong value judgment. Since the times of enlightenment it has been described metaphorically by the myth of the expulsion from Paradise. Following Max Weber and Wilhelm Dilthey, Karl Jaspers has introduced this perspective into psychiatry. His strict dichotomy between explaining and understanding has later been critically revised by Werner Janzarik and Hans Heimann. Their concepts of structure dynamic, of pathography and of anthropology are closer to Max Weber who connected natural and cultural sciences in a much stronger way. Especially the pathographic example of Nietzsche allows to demonstrate the differences between Jaspers and the later psychopathologists of the Heidelberg and T\u00fcbingen schools."}, {"Title": "Changed relative to what? Housekeeping genes and normalization strategies in human brain gene expression studies.", "Abstract": "Many studies in biological psychiatry compare the abundance of individual messenger RNAs between cases and control subjects or, more recently, between genotype groups. Most utilize some form of normalization procedure, usually expressing the transcript(s) of interest relative to that of a housekeeping gene or genes (also called reference genes), to overcome various sources of experimental error. Indeed, normalization is such a standard procedure that its purpose, principles, and limitations are sometimes overlooked, and some papers lack sufficient information as to its implementation. Here, we review the rationales for normalization and argue that in well-conducted psychiatric gene expression studies using human brain tissue, it is reducing intersubject variability rather than experimental error that is the major benefit of normalization. We also review the conceptual and empirical basis for the category of housekeeping genes-i.e., genes with a ubiquitous and invariant expression. We conclude that the evidence is against any such simple categorization and that a more pragmatic, less dogmatic, approach to the selection and implementation of reference genes is required, which takes into account the particular issues that pertain to human brain tissue studies. This pragmatism extends to the issue of whether normalization should be to one or multiple reference genes. We end by making several recommendations toward a more flexible, transparent, and comprehensive approach to data presentation and analysis. We illustrate the review with examples from studies of schizophrenia and mood disorder."}, {"Title": "Criteria for the ethical conduct of psychiatric neurosurgery clinical trials.", "Abstract": "There is an urgent need for an effective therapy for treatment-refractory mental illness.

What is required is a standard of ethical practice, globally applied, for neurosurgical trials in psychiatry that protects patients and maintains a high ethical benchmark for clinicians and researchers to meet. With mental illness, as well as treatment resistance, reaching epidemic proportions, ethically and scientifically sound clinical trials will lead to effective and safe surgical treatments that will become vital components of the clinicians' armamentarium.

Movement disorders are well-established indications for DBS, and a number of other neurological and psychiatric indications are currently being investigated. Numerous contemporary opinions, reviews, and viewpoints on DBS fail to provide a comprehensive account of how this method came into being. Misconceptions in the narrative history of DBS conveyed by the wealth of literature published over the last 2 decades can be summarized as follows: Deep brain stimulation was invented in 1987. The utility of high-frequency stimulation was also discovered in 1987. Lesional surgery preceded DBS. Deep brain stimulation was first used in the treatment of movement disorders and was subsequently used in the treatment of psychiatric and behavioral disorders. Reports of nonmotor effects of subthalamic nucleus DBS prompted its use in psychiatric illness. Early surgical interventions for psychiatric illness failed to adopt a multidisciplinary approach; neurosurgeons often worked \"in isolation\" from other medical specialists. The involvement of neuro-ethicists and multidisciplinary teams are novel standards introduced in the modern practice of DBS for mental illness that are essential in avoiding the unethical behavior of bygone eras. In this paper, the authors examined each of these messages in the light of literature published since 1947 and formed the following conclusions. Chronic stimulation of subcortical structures was first used in the early 1950s, very soon after the introduction of human stereotaxy. Studies and debate on the stimulation frequency most likely to achieve desirable results and avoid side effects date back to the early days of DBS; several authors advocated the use of \"high\" frequency, although the exact frequency was not always specified. Ablative surgery and electrical stimulation developed in parallel, practically since the introduction of human stereotactic surgery. The first applications of both ablative surgery and chronic subcortical stimulation were in psychiatry, not in movement disorders. The renaissance of DBS in surgical treatment of psychiatric illness in 1999 had little to do with nonmotor effects of subthalamic nucleus DBS but involved high-frequency stimulation of the very same brain targets previously used in ablative surgery. Pioneers in functional neurosurgery mostly worked in multidisciplinary groups, including when treating psychiatric illness; those \"acting in isolation\" were not neurosurgeons. Ethical concerns have indeed been addressed in the past, by neurosurgeons and others. Some of the questionable behavior in surgery for psychiatric illness, including the bygone era of DBS, was at the hands of nonneurosurgeons. These practices have been deemed as \"dubious and precarious by yesterday's standards.\""}, {"Title": "[Differences in the course of depressive disorders among women and men measured by MMPI-2].", "Abstract": "The aim of the study is to assess the differences between clinical scales of MMPI-2 among women and men suffering from depressive disorders.\n36 patients were examined (aged 23-62 years, average age = 51.27, SD = 8.84): 19 women (52.77%, aged 23-59, average age = 51.16, SD = 4.74) and 17 men (47.23%, aged: 23-61, average age = 51.41, SD = 12.07).

The authors analyzed basic science knowledge, clerkship performance, humanism, leadership, community service, research fellowships, distinctions, and honors.\nThere were no statistically significant differences between the groups in clerkship honors other than psychiatry (HuMed students outperformed their peers, P < .0001) or in commencement distinctions or honors. Although HuMed students were significantly more likely to secure a scholarly-year mentored project (P = .001), there was no difference in graduating with distinction in research (P = .281). HuMed students were more likely to have lower United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores (221 +/- 20 versus 227 +/- 19, P = .0039) and to take a nonscholarly leave of absence (P = .0001).

The authors explored the effects of the military's method of physician payment on physicians' returns on educational investment for several specialties.\nThis retrospective, observational study used national data from 2003 and standard financial techniques to calculate the net present value-the current value of an expected stream of cash flows at a particular rate of interest-of the educational investments of medical students in ten 30-year career paths: either military or civilian careers in internal medicine, psychiatry, gastroenterology, general surgery, or orthopedics.\nAt a 5% discount rate, in the civilian world, the lowest return on an educational investment accrued to psychiatrists ($1.136 million) and the highest to orthopedists ($2.489 million), a range of $1.354 million. In the military, the lowest returns accrued to internists ($1.377 million) and the highest to orthopedists ($1.604 million); however, the range was only $0.227 million, one-sixth that found in the civilian sector. The authors also found that most military physicians do not remain in the military for their full careers.\nChoosing a military career substantially decreases the net present value of an educational investment for interventionalists, but it does so only modestly for primary care physicians. Further, a military career path markedly diminishes specialty-specific variation in the net present values of educational investment. Adopting a military structure for engaging medical students might help reverse the current trend of declining interest in primary care."}, {"Title": "An unusual case of mesalazine intoxication: oral and rectal overloading of the rectal suppository form.", "Abstract": "Drugs containing 5-acetylsalicylic acid (5-ASA) have been commonly used for inflammatory bowel diseases for more than half a century, but no case about overdose of suppository form of mesalazine which was taken both orally and rectally has been reported in the related literature up to now.

There are no special diversion programs in Germany but diversion does in fact happen via legal regulations that are based on the construct of legal responsibility. Diversion refers to the removal of offenders from the criminal justice system at any stage of the procedure and court proceedings. In recent years the number of occupied beds in forensic psychiatric hospitals has continued to rise. At the same time the number of people in prisons has slightly decreased while there has been a slight increase in the number of available beds in general psychiatry. Germany experienced public and media concern about the risk posed by conditionally released mentally ill offenders and other perceived inadequacies in the criminal justice system. Therefore the way in which prisoners or forensic patients are supervised after they have been discharged was reformed in 2007 in order to assure a more efficient control of their conduct after their release from custody by means of mandatory treatment and monitoring. Special outpatient clinics were to assist discharged patients in complying with the conditions of probation and parole. However organisational structures for these specialised outpatient institutions vary within Germany because of its federal administration. This results in regional differences in conditions of treatment and probably in differences in quality as well, but surveys about the effects, efficacy or effectiveness of forensic outpatient treatment in Germany are scarce."}, {"Title": "Geropsychology and psychogeriatrics in Portugal: research, education and clinical training.", "Abstract": "In response to the global challenges of population aging in Portugal, it is crucial to improve research, education and clinical training in old age in order to meet the growing demands placed on psychogeriatric care services.\nAn overview is provided on the status of old age psychology and psychiatry as part of the multidisciplinary care delivery system for the elderly in Portugal. Available educational offerings and clinical training in geriatric mental health at both undergraduate and postgraduate level are described, as well as primary research associations and initiatives within Portugal.\nImportant issues raised include the need for more educational and clinical training programs for specialists, a broader commitment to aging research and the need to increase interest in working with older adults among students across disciplines. The recent movement towards multidisciplinary work conducted by researchers, psychiatrists, psychologist and other health professionals in Portugal points to the urgent need for specialist education for all health professionals working in geriatrics. This educational initiative must focus not only on the transmission of knowledge on aging-related topics, but also on the training of specific skills and competencies. Improving geriatric mental health service delivery and connecting research with clinical practice constitute other significant steps forward.\nAn effective intervention in psychogeriatrics should involve a strategy with the participation of a multidimensional network that includes the commitment of researchers, educators, clinicians, health policy-makers and older adults.

For the purpose of the current paper we reviewed publications summarizing results of clinical trials.\nPatients suffering from schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa or borderline personality disorder exhibited a decrease in the amplitude of error-negativity when compared with healthy controls, while in cases of depression and anxiety an increase in the amplitude has been observed. Some of the articles suggest specific personality variables, such as impulsivity, perfectionism, negative emotions or sensitivity to punishment to underlie these electrophysiological differences.\nResearch in the field of error-related electric activity has come to the focus of psychiatry research only recently, thus the amount of available data is significantly limited.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether rural hospital chief executive officers (CEOs) in the USA report shortages of health professions and to obtain perceptions about factors influencing recruiting and retention.\nA nationwide US survey was conducted of 1031 rural hospital CEOs identified by regional/state Area Health Education Centers. A three-page survey was sent containing questions about whether or not physician shortages were present in the CEO's community and asking about physician needs by specialty. The CEOs were also asked to assess whether other health professionals were needed in their town or within a 48 km (30 mile) radius. Analyses from 335 respondents (34.4%) representative of rural hospital CEOs in the USA are presented.\nPrimary care shortages based on survey responses were very similar to the pattern for all rural areas in the USA (49% vs 52%, respectively). The location of respondents according to ZIP code rurality status was similar to all rural areas in the USA (moderately rural, 29.3% vs 27.6%, respectively), and 69.1% were located in highly rural ZIP codes (vs 72.4% of highly rural ZIP codes for all USA). Physician shortages were reported by 75.4% of the rural CEOs, and 70.3% indicated shortages of two or more primary care specialties. The most frequently reported shortage was family medicine (FM, 58.3%) followed by general internal medicine (IM, 53.1%). Other reported shortages were: psychiatry (46.6%); general surgery (39.9%); neurology (36.4%); pediatrics (PEDS, 36.2%); cardiology (35%); and obstetrics-gynecology (34.4%). The three most commonly needed allied health professions were registered nurses (73.5%), physical therapists (61.2%) and pharmacists (51%). The percentage of CEOs reporting shortages of two or more primary care specialties (FM, IM or PEDS) was 70.3% nationally, with no statistically significant regional variation (p = .394), while higher for the New England through Virginia region (83.9%) than for all other regions. The CEOs reported the highest specialty care shortages for psychiatry (46.6%) followed by general surgery (39.9%), neurology (36.4%), cardiology (35.0%) and obstetrics-gynecology (34.4%). Major specialty shortages varied among regions and only for neurology and cardiology were regional differences statistically significant (p < .05). Marked variation between need for healthcare professionals were reported ranging from approximately 73% for registered nurses (RNs) to 16% for health educators. Reporting of need for RNs in rural areas was nearly 74% nationally and 35% reported a need for nurse practitioners. Differences for both RNs and nurse practitioners were not statistically significant among regions. Nationally, approximately 30% of CEOs reported a shortage of licensed practical nurses, which differed significantly among regions (p = .006). There was variation in physical therapist shortages among regions (p = .001), with 61.2% of CEOs reporting shortages nationally. Regional variation pattern was observed for pharmacists (p = .004) with approximately 50% of rural CEOs reporting a need for pharmacists nationally. The association between CEOs' reported shortages of two or more primary care doctors and their indication of the need for other health professionals was statistically significant for nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, and dentists. The recruitment and retention attributes deemed to be of greatest importance were: (1) healthcare is a major part of the local economy; (2) community is a good place for family; (3) doctors are well-respected and supported; and (4) people in the community are friendly and supportive of each other. These were remarkably similar across 6 US geographic regions.\nSimilarities in shortages and attributes influencing recruitment across regions suggest that major policy and program interventions are needed to develop a rural health professions workforce that will enable the benefits of recent US health reform insurance coverage to be realized. Substantial and targeted programs to increase rural healthcare professionals are needed."}, {"Title": "Potential psychiatric applications of metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists and antagonists.", "Abstract": "Drugs acting at metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are among the most promising agents under development for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. The research in this area is at a relatively early stage, as there are no drugs acting at mGluRs that have been approved for the treatment of any psychiatric disorder. However, in the areas of schizophrenia, anxiety disorders and mood disorders, research conducted in animal models appears to translate well into efficacy in human laboratory-based models of psychopathology and in preliminary clinical trials. Further, the genes coding for mGluRs are implicated in the risk for a growing number of psychiatric disorders. This review highlights the best studied mGluR strategies for psychiatry, based on human molecular genetics, studies in animal models and preliminary clinical trials. It describes the potential value of mGluR2 and mGluR5 agonists and positive allosteric modulators for the treatment of schizophrenia. It also reviews evidence that group II mGluR agonists and positive allosteric modulators as well as group I mGluR antagonists might also treat anxiety disorders and some forms of depression, while mGluR2 and group I mGluR antagonists (particularly mGluR5 antagonists) might have antidepressant properties. This review also links growing insights into the role of glutamate in the pathophysiology of these disorders to hypothesized mGluR-related treatment mechanisms."}, {"Title": "[Forensic psychiatry and psychology in the evaluation for forensic sexology].", "Abstract": "The authors intended to reflect about the contribution of Forensic Psychiatry and Psychology in the evaluation of sexual offences, according to the Portuguese legislation and medical legal issues."}, {"Title": "[Memory and trauma impact: a development approach].", "Abstract": "The purpose of this article is to review the main neuroanatomic structures and the neurotransmission process involved at memory. Memory is dynamic based on the reunion of aspects of neuronal activation, in a process based on the individual experiences. It will be described the importance of limbic regions and their interaction during processing, codification and consolidation of a memory - each one related with neuronal rebuild. Further the authors describe the memory types known (explicit and implicit memories); the characteristics and their progress during normal development. It will be addressed other issues like child amnesia, retrieval and trauma. Forgetting is one of the essential features at explicit memory. Many studies describe a U inverted effect at memories with emotional value. Events with moderate or elevated emotional intensity are printed as important (by limbic structures like amygdala and orbito-frontal cortex) being more easily recorded. If the experience is very intense the explicit memory codification processing at hippocampus will be inhibited and as a consequence also does the retrieval. Meanwhile the implicit memory will remain and may constitute pathologic memories. The psychological trauma blocks the explicit memory processing which will jeopardize the cortical consolidation of the traumatic experience. Focus on trauma an important question is memory precision and the impact of trauma, on a neurophysiologic and psychopathologic way. Trauma and stress aren't inoffensive because their presence will induce pathological neuronal rebuilding (myelination, synapse formation, neurogenesis) at main memory structures like amygdala or hippocampus. When the nature of the changes is irreversible the explicit memory processing, learning and Psychiatry syndromes may arouse, for example: Mood and Anxiety disorders (including Posttraumatic Stress Disorder); Personality Disorders; Dissociative disorders; Psychosis."}, {"Title": "Teaching child and adolescent psychiatry to undergraduate medical students - A survey in German-speaking countries.", "Abstract": "To conduct a survey about teaching child and adolescent psychiatry to undergraduate medical students in German-speaking countries.\nA questionnaire was sent to the 33 academic departments of child and adolescent psychiatry in Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking part of Switzerland.\nAll departments responded. For teaching knowledge, the methods most commonly reported were lectures and case presentations. The most important skills to be taught were thought to be how to assess psychopathology in children and how to assess families. For elective courses, the departments reported using a wide range of teaching methods, many with active involvement of the students. An average of 34 hours per semester is currently allocated by the departments for teaching child and adolescent psychiatry to medical students. Required courses are often taught in cooperation with adult psychiatry and pediatrics. Achievement of educational objectives is usually assessed with written exams or multiple-choice tests. Only a minority of the departments test the achievement of skills.\nTwo ways of improving education in child and adolescent psychiatry are the introduction of elective courses for students interested in the field and participation of child and adolescent psychiatrists in required courses and in longitudinal courses so as to reach all students. Cooperation within and across medical schools can enable departments of child and adolescent psychiatry, despite limited resources, to become more visible and this specialty to become more attractive to medical students.

Data from a multivariate cross-sectional study of 136 acute psychiatric wards in England were used to conduct this analysis.\nSeclusion is used infrequently on English acute psychiatric wards (0.05 incidents per day), whereas time-out use was more frequent (0.31 incidents per day). Usage of seclusion was strongly associated with the availability of a seclusion room. Seclusion was associated with aggression, alcohol use, absconding, and medication refusal, whereas time-out was associated with these and other more minor conflict behaviors. Both were associated with the giving of \"as required\" medication, coerced intramuscular medication, and manual restraint. Relationships with exit security for the ward were also found.\nGiven its low usage rate, the scope for seclusion reduction in English acute psychiatry may be small. Seclusion reduction initiatives need to take a wider range of factors into account. Some substitution of seclusion with time-out may be possible, but a rigorous trial is required to establish this. The safety of intoxicated patients in seclusion requires more attention."}, {"Title": "Detached concern of forensic mental health nurses in therapeutic relationships with patients the application of the early recognition method related to detached concern.", "Abstract": "Improvement of the interaction between forensic mental health nurses and patients may lead to a reduction of inpatient violence. The concept under study is detached concern, which refers to nurses' skills to neutralize the emotional appeal of patients by a balanced attitude between objectivity and emotional involvement. The Patient Contact Questionnaire (PCQ) aims at measuring the degree of concern of nurses for their patients.\nThe PCQ was applied in a pretest-posttest design, evaluating the effects of the Early Recognition Method (ERM). This method aims at the prevention of inpatient violence in forensic psychiatry. Subjects were 116 forensic mental heath nurses working on 16 wards of a large Dutch forensic hospital. First, the baseline scores were compared to scores reported in an earlier study conducted in general psychiatry. Second, pretest-posttest comparisons were carried out for all nurses, and for subgroups of nurses with regard to gender, educational level, years of working experience, and patient population. Third, pretest-posttest comparisons were made on the PCQ item level.\nThe baseline scores of male nurses indicated significantly higher levels of concern than those of female nurses. In addition, more experienced nurses scored significantly higher with regard to concern than less experienced nurses. When comparing the scores before and after applying ERM, no significant differences were found. However, the sores of female nurses showed a tendency toward more concern after implementation of ERM.\nDetached concern may be a meaningful concept in forensic mental health nursing in measuring nurses' concern for their patients. Levels of detached concern did not change significantly after application of ERM.

This triple challenge is very demanding, and results in permanent insecurity of University employees. To compensate for the insufficient clinical training, some institutes in the USA employ academic staff members exclusively for teaching. The formation of new subspecialties hinders the education and training of general neurologists. At present, four generations of medical doctors are working together in hospitals. The two older generations educate the younger neurologists who have been brought up in the world of limitless network of sterile information. Therefore their manual skills at the bedside and their knowledge of emergency treatment are deficient. Demographics of medical doctors changed drastically. Twice as many women are working in neurology and psychiatry than men. Integrity of neurology is threatened by: (1) Separation of the cerebrovascular diseases from general neurology. Development of \"stroke units\" was facilitated by the better reimbursement for treatment and by the interest of the pharmaceutical companies. Healthcare politics promoted the split of neurology into two parts. The independent status of \"stroke departments\" will reduce the rest of clinical neurology to outpatient service. (2) The main argumentation to segregate the rare neurological diseases was that their research will provide benefit for the diseases with high prevalence. This argumentation serves territorial ambitions. The separation of rare diseases interferes with the teaching of differential diagnostics in neurological training. The traditional pragmatic neurology can not be retrieved. The faculty of neurology could retain its integrity by the improvement of diagnostic methods and the ever more effective drugs. Nevertheless, even the progression of neurological sciences induces dissociation of clinical neurology.

The movement from the use of the term 'patient' to that of 'consumer' will be examined as emblematic of a modification of the clinical relationship.\nThe use of terms from economics has widely permeated our society. In an increasingly consumer-oriented society, the survey has become a study methodology of choice. Indeed, within psychiatry we have attempted to resolve the question of what to call our patients through surveys. There has been little discussion regarding the permeation of the language of economics in the clinical field and thus critiques of this process have arisen from other domains. It is argued that such changes have eroded the traditional clinical relationship of the psychiatrist and patient."}, {"Title": "Somatic diseases in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder.", "Abstract": "Numerous studies indicate that the exposure to traumatic events and psychological trauma is a widespread. Studies also show the frequency of comorbidity of mental disorders in patients with posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD), while the effects of exposure to traumatic events on somatic health have been neglected for a long time. As PTSD might have a devastating effect on physical integrity and general health, the aim of this study was to show the prevalence of somatic problems in patients with PTSD.\nAnalyzed were 217 patients treated in the period from 2005 to 2008 at the Traumatic Stress Disorders Unit of the Department for Psychiatry Tuzla, in which PTSD was diagnosed using DSM IV criteria. The medical records, Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) - version for Bosnia and Herzegovina for identification of war traumatic events and PTSD symptoms, modified Domestic Violence Inventory, general questionnaire on socio-demographic data and data related to psychosocial issues were used in this study. Somatic diseases were diagnosed by ICD-10.\nThe average age of patients was 48.0246.33 years, with somewhat higher prevalence of male patients (136 ys 81). The highest number have completed secondary school (73.3%), were married (88%), employed (61.3%) and, of domicile status (83.4%). Out of 217 patients, in 85.7% the PTSD was related to war traumatic experiences. Somatic complaints and diagnosed chronic somatic diseases were present in 184 or 84.8% patients of both sexes. The highest number of patients had a hypertension, angina pectoris, back pain and degenerative bone diseases, as well as cerebrovascular disease and diabetes. More than three chronic somatic diseases were present in 85 or 39.2% patients with PTSD, and most frequent psycho-social problems were insufficient financial resources and a job loss.\nBased on the results of this study it can be concluded that association of somatic diseases with posttraumatic stress disorder is often present in persons who were exposed to multiple war traumatic experiences and more psychosocial problems."}, {"Title": "Epigenetics and depression: current challenges and new therapeutic options.", "Abstract": "Epigenetics comprises heritable but concurrent variable modifications of genomic DNA defining gene expression. The aim of this publication is to review the field of epigenetics in depression. Within this scope, we outline potential therapeutic options evolving in this young field of psychiatric research.\nRecently published papers show that epigenetic mechanisms like histone modifications and DNA methylation affect diverse pathways leading to depression-like behaviors in animal models. Adverse alterations of gene expression profiles, including glucocorticoid receptor or brain-derived neurotrophic factor, were shown to be inducible by early life stress and reversible by epigenetic drugs. Postmortem studies revealed epigenetic changes in the frontal cortex of depressed suicide victims. There exists profound evidence for histone deacetylase inhibitors to be a novel line of effective antidepressants via counteracting previously acquired adverse epigenetic marks.\nBecause of the complex causal factors leading to depression, epigenetics is of considerable interest for the understanding of early life stress in depression. The current research regarding epigenetic pharmaceuticals is promising and deserves further attention in depression and psychiatry in general, and may strike out new ways towards individually tailored therapies."}, {"Title": "Some gestalt contributions to psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Gestalt theory and methods support significant behavioral change and personal growth, yet they have not been widely incorporated into modern psychiatric practice.

If inputs represent the information transferred from the patient to the physician, then inputs include history, physical examination, testing, diagnoses, and patient demographics. Outputs include medications prescribed and other therapies used, including education and counseling, procedures performed, and disposition. The complexity of each input/output is defined as the mean input/output quantity per clinical encounter weighted by its inter-encounter diversity (range of possibilities used) and variability (visit-to-visit change). In complex systems, as the information in the input increases linearly, the complexity of the system increases exponentially. To assess the impact of the complexity of the encounter on the physician, we adjusted the estimated complexity by the duration-of-visit.\nUsing the 2000 NAMCS database, we calculated input and output complexities for 3 specialties. Construct validity was affirmed by comparing the relative rankings of complexity against relative rankings using other complexity-related measures. Although total relative complexity was similar for family medicine (44.04 +/- 0.0024 SE) and cardiology (42.78 +/- 0.0004 standard error [SE]), when adjusted for duration-of-visit, family medicine had a greater complexity density per hour (167.33 +/- 0.0095 SE) than either cardiology (125.4 +/- 0.0117 SE) or psychiatry (31.21 +/- 0.0027 SE).\nThis method estimates complexity based on the amount of care provided weighted by its diversity and variability.

This review examines epigenetics as a candidate biological mechanism for gene x environment interactions, with a focus on environmental influences that occur during early life and that yield sustained effects on neural development and function.\nThe studies reviewed suggest that epigenetic remodeling occurs in response to the environmental activation of cellular signalling pathways associated with synaptic plasticity, epigenetic marks are actively remodeled during early development in response to environmental events that regulate neural development and function, and epigenetic marks are subject to remodeling by environmental influences even at later stages in development.\nEpigenetic remodeling might serve as an ideal mechanism for phenotypic plasticity--the process whereby the environment interacts with the genome to produce individual differences in the expression of specific traits."}, {"Title": "Progress in cytogenetics: implications for child psychopathology.", "Abstract": "This review considers the impact of chromosomal studies on the understanding of childhood neuropsychiatric syndromes, highlighting key discoveries, advances in technology, and new challenges faced by clinicians trying to interpret recent findings.\nWe review the literature on the genetics of child psychiatric disorders, including autism, childhood-onset schizophrenia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and Tourette syndrome, with a focus on studies of chromosomal structure.\nOver several decades, cytogenetic investigations have led to key findings relevant to child psychiatry. During this time, technology has transitioned from light microscopy to molecular cytogenetics to microarray-based detection of structural variation, resulting in a dramatic increase in the resolution of such approaches. Each of these methods has contributed to the understanding of the genetic bases of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. Moreover, the implementation of microarray technology has prompted a reconceptualization of the nature of human genetic variation, demonstrating that both the sequence of DNA as well as the fine structure of chromosomes vary in affected and unaffected individuals.\nThe study of chromosomal variation at high resolution continues to be a promising area of research that is yielding critical data regarding the genetic underpinnings of childhood psychiatric disorders. Preliminary data indicate that apparently identical submicroscopic variations in chromosomal structure may predispose to a very broad range of phenotypes.

This study evaluated the odds of agreement versus disagreement for internalizing and externalizing problems as a function of child age, gender, race, public-aid status, symptom severity, and impairment among 900 children (3-19 years) in a large, urban, child psychiatry clinic. A mixed-effects regression approach was used to evaluate the relationship between disagreement and visit attendance. Internalizing problem disagreement was more likely for children who were males, older, less symptomatic, and receiving Medicaid. Externalizing problem disagreement was more likely for children who were female, older, less impaired, and less symptomatic. Internalizing disagreement predicted significantly fewer visits; externalizing disagreement did not. Clinician-parent disagreement about the nature of child problems may have clinical consequences, especially for internalizing disorders.

The shift to symptom-based operationalized diagnostic criteria in DSM-III further exacerbated this difficulty because of the contextually based nature of the distinction between normal distress and mental disorder, which often display similar symptoms.

For the purpose of diagnosis, use can be made of scientific evidence of specificity yielding high diagnostic likelihood ratios rather than evidence of weak mean differences yielding low diagnostic likelihood ratios. In the case of psychosis, the evidence appears to favour a syndromal system of classification combining categorical and dimensional representations. The concept of 'salience' has the potential to make the public recognise psychosis as relating to an aspect of human mentation and experience that is universal.\nThe debate about alternatives to diagnose expressions of psychosis is often misunderstood as a misguided attempt to change societal stigma. In reality, however, it is about reduction of iatrogenic stigma occasioned by the use of unscientific and mystifying terminology.

Being aware of these unspoken subtleties can offer a psychiatrist valuable information that a patient may be unwilling or unable to put into words."}, {"Title": "Use of pharmacotherapy for insomnia in child psychiatry practice: A national survey.", "Abstract": "To examine clinical practice patterns regarding non-prescription and prescription medication use for insomnia by child and adolescent psychiatrists.\nSurvey mailed to 6018 members of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\nThe final sample (N=1273) reported that insomnia was a major problem in almost a third of their school-aged and adolescent patients and endorsed using medication to treat the insomnia in at least a quarter of these patients. Overall, 96% of respondents recommended at least one of the listed prescription medications in a typical month, and 88% recommended an over-the-counter medication. Alpha agonists were the most commonly prescribed insomnia medication for ADHD (81%), significantly higher than in MR/DD (67%), mood (40%), or anxiety disorders (31%). Trazodone was the most commonly prescribed insomnia medication for children with mood (78%) and anxiety disorders (72%). Antidepressants as a class were also commonly used for children in these diagnostic groups. Atypical antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and short-acting hypnotics were also more likely to be used in children with mood disorders. Melatonin was recommended by more than one-third of respondents. Mitigation of the effects of sleep disruption on daytime functioning was endorsed as an important rationale for the use of sleep medication; concerns about side effects and the lack of empirical support regarding efficacy were cited as significant barriers to their use.\nInsomnia is a significant clinical problem in children treated by child psychiatrists for a variety of behavioral, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric conditions. Management with a broad array of psychotropic medications is common and indicates a highly variable clinical approach to insomnia in this pediatric population."}, {"Title": "The EU paediatric regulation: effects on paediatric psychopharmacology in Europe.", "Abstract": "Child and adolescent psychiatry is a relatively young field and the recognition, classification, and treatment of disorders in children and adolescents lag behind those in adults. In recent years there is an increasing awareness of the differences between children and adults in psychopathology and pharmacology. Related to this new paediatric regulations have been introduced. This article reviews the regulatory and legislative measures that were adopted in the EU in 2007 and the subsequent impact of these measures on the field of paediatric psychopharmacology. The consequences of the paediatric regulation in the EU are reflected in several domains: regulatory, research aimed at drug development and clinical practices. In the regulatory domain, the consequences include: new paediatric indications, inclusion of special (class) warnings, specification of dose regimens, and information on safety specific to children and adolescents, and development of new medicinal formulations. The paediatric regulation leads to timely development of paediatric friendly formulations and better quality of the clinical evidence. In clinical practices, an increased awareness of the uniqueness of paediatric pharmacology is emerging among medical professionals, and subsequent improvement of medical care (i.e. correct doses, appropriate formulation, monitoring for expected adverse events). In addition, clinical guidelines will have to be revised more frequently in order to integrate the recently acquired knowledge. The new regulations stimulate transparency and discussions between academia, pharmaceutical industry, and regulators. The purpose is to optimize clinical research and obtain evidence for paediatric psychopharmacology, thereby providing adequate support for treatment."}, {"Title": "[Metabolic side effects of risperidone in early onset schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "Atypical antipsychotics have a favourable risk/benefit profile in early onset schizophrenia (EOS). However, despite increasing use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents, their endocrine and metabolic side-effects (weight gain, obesity, and related metabolic abnormalities such as hyperglycaemia and dyslipidemia) are of particular concern, especially within this paediatric population that appears to be at greater risk as compared with adults for antipsychotic-induced metabolic adverse effects. In addition to medication, many factors contribute to weigh gain in psychiatric patients, including sedentary lifestyle and poor diet. Excessive weigh gain has several deleterious effects in psychiatric patients, including stigmatization and further social withdrawal, and non compliance with medication. Furthermore, excessive corpulence may evolve to a metabolic syndrome with a high-risk state for future cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adult age. Because youths are still developing at the time of psychotropic drug exposure, in a context of physiological changes in hormonal and endocrines levels and body composition, most reference values need to be adjusted for gender, age and growth charts. Hence, sex- and age-adjusted BMI percentiles and BMI Z scores are crucial to assess weight gain in children and adolescents.\nObesity thresholds have been proposed to define \"at risk\" categories of patients. In recently issued guidelines, thresholds for antipsychotic-induced weight gain in adults have been set at a 5% increase or one point increase in BMI unit. To date, no definition has reached a consensus in childhood and adolescence. However, some at risk states requiring action are proposed in literature: more than 5% increase in weight within a three-month period; more than half a point increase in BMI Z score; between 85th and 95th BMI percentile plus one adverse health consequence (i.e. hyperglycaemia, dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, or orthopaedic, gallbladder, or sleep disorder); or more than 95th BMI percentile or abdominal obesity (i.e. abdominal circumference above 90th percentile). As a matter of fact, numerous studies that have assessed weight gain during antipsychotic treatment are clearly limited, either because of their short duration (a few weeks), or because of their methodology: indeed, only weight gain is generally reported as an assessment tool. Merely noting an increase in body weight over time does not in itself signify a problem, and may underscore the importance of excessive corpulence growth as compared with controls. Adjusted BMI percentiles and BMI Z scores were calculated in only a few studies.\nThis pilot study focuses on the metabolic effects of risperidone in children and adolescents up to 16 years of age. This study is part of a larger, regional study on metabolic side effects of antipsychotic medication in adults, promoted by the university hospital centre in Lille, France.\nPatients included in the study were referred to our department of child and adolescent psychiatry for EOS (K-SADS). They had received no antipsychotic treatment prior to their inclusion. Weight, height, sex- and age-related BMI percentiles and BMI Z scores, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting triglyceride levels, fasting total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and fasting glucose level were measured at M0, M3, and M6. BMI, sex- and age-related BMI percentiles and adjusted BMI Z scores were obtained from tables and calculator (www.kidsnutrition.org).\nTwenty-six children and adolescents (21 males, five females) aged 7 to 15.5 years (mean=12.9 years, sd=2.3) were included. They all received a diagnosis of schizophrenia according to the schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia for school-aged children (K-SADS). They all received risperidone from 1mg/day to a maximum of 6 mg/day. Statistical analysis principally shows a significant link between prescription of risperidone in EOS and six-months increases of BMI (increase of 4.7 kg/m(2), p<0.0001), sex- and age-adjusted BMI percentile (increase of 29.3 points, p<0.0025), and BMI Z scores (increase of 1.1 point, p<0.0001). No patient showed metabolic syndrome, but one girl presented with a 1g/l increase of fasting total cholesterol at two-months.\nDespite the limited number of children included, our results confirm a strong link between prescription of risperidone in EOS and risk of obesity. Clinicians and caregivers need to be aware of the potential endocrine and metabolic adverse effects of atypical antipsychotics, and systematically ask for family history of metabolic disorder, life style, diet and habits. With adolescents, the sole monitoring of weight gain, and even of BMI, underestimates the gain of corpulence. One methodological implication of our study is that adjusted BMI Z scores are the best-suited measure to assess long-term drug-induced weight gain in comparison to developmental changes.\nAlternative treatment should be considered in some cases. Other antipsychotics, like aripiprazole, may have a better benefit/risk ratio and then may be prescribed as a first prescription or as a switch. Associations of antipsychotics may also be of interest but we lack controlled studies in children and adolescents. In some cases, alternative treatments like repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulations (rTMS) may be required. Their efficacy and their place in the therapeutic strategy of pharmacoresistant schizophrenia in children and adolescents have to be assessed in regard to metabolic and blood side effects of clozapine."}, {"Title": "V-RISK-10: validation of a screen for risk of violence after discharge from acute psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Current violence risk assessment instruments are time-consuming and mainly developed for forensic psychiatry.

The percentage of self reported life time cannabis (LTC) use was 2.83% (103, all males). Sixteen percent (576) of the total cohort was diagnosed with SSD by 2009. Male sex and LTC use were significantly associated with SSD (p < 0.01 and 0.001 respectively). In the majority (91.5%), cannabis use preceded the diagnosis. There were 17(16.5%) patients diagnosed as cannabis induced psychosis and 7 (41.2%) of them were subsequently diagnosed as SSD. This group was significantly more likely to have had a past psychiatric consultation, but other demographic and clinical correlates did not differ from the rest of the LTC users.\nSelf reported LTC use was strongly associated with being diagnosed with SSD.

Treatment of ADHD with stimulants is one of the oldest and most effective pharmacological treatments in psychiatry. Yet, there continues to be controversy over the safety of stimulant medications in the treatment of ADHD.\nThis paper is a continuation of an earlier paper that reviewed the safety profile of newer stimulant agents, especially in relation to special populations. This part II reviews, through essentially an organ-system approach, the various clinical concerns that have been raised over the safety of stimulant medications. This includes neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular effects on growth and development, and a number of other less common concerns.\nA thorough review of safety concerns in stimulants that emphasizes clinical information, case reports, open series or controlled trials relating to stimulant use in the treatment of ADHD.\nWhile many safety concerns have been raised in the use of stimulants, the vast majority of treatment complications are either quickly reversible or easily manageable with appropriate clinical care.

In both systems, carved-out programs de-link services from other mental health and general health care. Barriers are also rooted in disciplinary differences and weak clinical linkages between psychiatry, primary care and substance use, and in confidentiality policies that inhibit communication and coordination, while protecting patient privacy.\nIn this era of health care reform, we have the opportunity to increase access for adolescents and develop new models of integrated services for those with co-occurring conditions.

Public interest and support for neuroscience research through initiatives like the Decade of the Brain project and increasingly diverse brain-related initiatives have created new interfaces between neuroscience and society. Against this backdrop of dynamic innovation, we set out to examine how different features of neuroscience are depicted in print media. We used the 'guided news' function of the LexisNexis Academic database with keyword searches to find news articles published between 1995 and 2004 in major U.S. and U.K. English-language news sources. We performed searches on headlines, lead paragraphs, and body terms to maximize search yields. All articles were coded for overall tone of coverage, details on reported studies, presence of ethical, legal, and social discussion as well as the emerging interpretations of neuroscience - in the form of neuro-essentialism, neuro-realism, and neuro-policy. We found that print media coverage of the use of neurotechnology for diagnosis or therapy in neuropsychiatric disorders was generally optimistic. We also found that, even within articles that were identified as research reports, many did not provide details about research studies. We also gained additional insights into the previously identified phenomena of neuro-essentialism, neuro-realism, and neuro-policy showing some profound impacts of neuroscience on personal identity and policy-making. Our results highlight the implications of transfer of neuroscience knowledge to society given the substantial and authoritative weight ascribed to neuroscience knowledge in defining who we are.

The context is the postcolonial development of the country and the crucial role played by the Catholic Church through several of its religious orders in developing and staffing intellectual disability services. The paper will consider the divergent positions of church and psychiatry in the foundation and contemporary position of what was originally known as the care of people with a mental handicap nursing in the 1960s. The development of this form of nursing during the mid-twentieth century can be seen as part of a wider postcolonial response to health and social care by the newly independent Irish state. The author argues that intellectual disability nursing in Ireland has been nuanced by association with the nation's struggle for self-determination from colonial oppression through adoption of a religious identity. This conflation of education and social care combined with a specific form of Catholic nursing has left an enduring legacy on the service provision to people with an intellectual disability in contemporary Ireland."}, {"Title": "Amygdala activation in response to facial expressions in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Exaggerated amygdala activation to threatening faces has been detected in adults and children with anxiety disorders, compared to healthy comparison (HC) subjects.

This article reviews the history of neuromarketing and uses an exploratory survey of neuromarketing Web sites to illustrate ethical issues raised by this new field. Neuromarketing, as currently practiced, is heterogeneous, as companies are offering a variety of technologies.

We wanted to gain more knowledge of what doctors find most difficult and the type of assistance they feel would be helpful.\nBased on their own experience, the authors developed a questionnaire with 13 questions; two open and 11 closed questions, and a possibility to write more detailed answers for four of the questions. The questionnaire was sent to a random sample of Norwegian doctors; 680 general practitioners (GPs) and 493 specialists within neurology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, psychiatry, and geriatrics. One reminder was sent. Answers to questions were categorised and frequency analyses performed.\nThe response rate was 52 % for GPs and 55 % for specialists. GPs reported that cognitive impairment, advanced age; substance abuse and alcohol problems were the most difficult areas to assess, while the specialist group found that substance abuse and alcohol problems, psychiatric disease and use of different medications were most difficult. The doctors are not satisfied with the assistance provided by the authorities in this area, and specifically ask for a specialised agency to which they can refer patients for assessment.\nMore specific guidelines and a formal second-line system would facilitate the burden on doctors."}, {"Title": "Review of the forensic psychiatry service at Zomba Mental Hospital and a comparison of forensic psychiatry services in Malawi and Scotland.", "Abstract": "This retrospective case-note study describes the demographic details, offences and diagnostic characteristics of 283 patients admitted to Zomba Mental Hospital, Malawi, after early diversion from the Criminal Justice System between May 1997 and February 2007. Given the historical links between Malawi and Scotland and the ongoing involvement of Scottish psychiatrists in the development of psychiatry in Malawi, a comparison is drawn between the provision of secure psychiatric treatment in these low- and high-income countries. Consistent with Scottish prison mental health team referrals and Scottish high secure psychiatric patients, the Malawian patients were predominantly men, poorly educated and drug misusing, but alcohol was less often a problem. Affective disorders were rarely diagnosed, as is also the case in the equivalent Scottish populations. In Malawi, there appears to be a problem with aftercare because many of the patients had been detained before. The length of detention was very short, other than an exceptional finding for substance misuse--a mental disorder with no Mental Health Act equivalence in the UK. Absconding was the commonest outcome. Malawian patients diverted from the Criminal Justice System are treated on general adult psychiatry wards where few secure measures can be offered. Further, there is little capacity for follow-up, no community compulsion legislation exists and psychiatric expertise is limited to a few disparate sites. However, the service is developing and the data in this study represent a small part of that ongoing programme."}, {"Title": "Ethical issues in forensic psychiatry in penal and other correctional facilities.", "Abstract": "Forensic mental health practitioners, especially psychiatrists working in jails, prisons or other correctional facilities, face special problems that are unlike others encountered in bioethics.\nLiterature published during the past year shows that the forensic psychiatrist has to adhere to role clarity: as a physician, he is primarily obligated to the treatment and well being of the incarcerated patients and is not exclusively an agent of social control. Moreover, the general conditions in a therapeutic setting (e.g. dealing with medical confidentiality) have to be clear and transparent to the patients. Different ethical models building a fitting framework for forensic practice are used.\nForensic psychiatric practice in penal and other correctional facilities poses particular ethical dilemmas. There is a great need for international humanitarian law, which serves both to protect vulnerable prisoners and to shield health professionals who treat prisoners with respect and dignity from abuse or penalty. It must be a common objective to find the right balance between protection from exploitation and access to research beneficial to prisoners."}, {"Title": "Commentary: Accurate medical student performance evaluations and professionalism assessment: \"Yes, we can!\".", "Abstract": "In this issue, Brenner and colleagues report a correlation between the frequency of negative comments in the \"dean's letter\" and future problems during a psychiatry residency program. Their study makes an important contribution to the body of literature on factors that predict professionalism-related performance issues during residency and suggests the importance of dependable data that can be used to predict and hopefully intervene early in the training of future physicians across all specialties. As we think about the implications of this study, important issues involving the standardization of medical student performance evaluations (MSPEs) and the assessment of professionalism are raised. Despite the Association of American Medical Colleges' 2002 guidelines for MSPEs, subsequent studies have revealed that considerable inconsistencies among the evaluations still remain. To enhance the accuracy and usefulness of the MSPEs in predicting \"problem residents,\" improved standardization is necessary. Moreover, Brenner's findings call for the development of more vigorous assessment of professionalism in undergraduate medical education, as well as more accurate reporting of these assessments to residency programs. Longitudinal assessment of professionalism with robust tools allows for the identification and possible remediation of students early in their undergraduate training. Insofar as unprofessional behavior in medical school is predictive not only of problems during residency but also of later disciplinary action against the practicing physician by state medical boards, it is the obligation of the medical school to the residency program and to society to identify and report these behaviors."}, {"Title": "Somatic symptom overlap in Beck Depression Inventory-II scores following myocardial infarction.", "Abstract": "Depression measures that include somatic symptoms may inflate severity estimates among medically ill patients, including those with cardiovascular disease.\nTo evaluate whether people receiving in-patient treatment following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) had higher somatic symptom scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) than a non-medically ill control group matched on cognitive/affective scores.\nSomatic scores on the BDI-II were compared between 209 patients admitted to hospital following an AMI and 209 psychiatry out-patients matched on gender, age and cognitive/affective scores, and between 366 post-AMI patients and 366 undergraduate students matched on gender and cognitive/affective scores.\nSomatic symptoms accounted for 44.1% of total BDI-II score for the 209 post-AMI and psychiatry out-patient groups, 52.7% for the 366 post-AMI patients and 46.4% for the students. Post-AMI patients had somatic scores on average 1.1 points higher than the students (P<0.001).

Many mental health difficulties are missed in this group, in particular the effects of trauma and loss and the resulting depression. LAC often move between placements, which further disrupts their care and therapeutic interventions. NICE recommends that in most mental health disorders, children and adolescents should receive specific psychological therapies as first-line treatment, before medication. This standard should apply to LAC. Setting The audit was conducted in the Lambeth CLAMHS, a specialist mental health team working with LAC. Question To ascertain if Lambeth LAC (living in the borough) are receiving psychotropic medication without CLAMHS input and as their only treatment. (All LAC who are on psychotropic medication should have been offered psychological treatments first.) Methods A questionnaire was sent out to Lambeth general practice (GP) surgeries to find out what medications children were prescribed, if any. When children were prescribed psychotropic medication checks were made to ascertain whether they were receiving input from mental health services. Results LAC were seen in 67 different GP surgeries across Lambeth. Responses from 63 surgeries relating to 145 children (87.34% of the total number) were received. Conclusions There were no LAC in Lambeth who were prescribed psychotropic medication without a CAMHS service being involved.

Yet, psychiatry's subject matter (personal psychopathology), current status of scientific knowledge and research, as well as marked inefficiency of many psychiatric treatments suggest that we might consider novel ontological, epistemological/epistemic, and ethical parameters that could both enrich psychiatric philosophical thought and enhance psychiatric therapeutic practice by rendering it more efficient. Within a realistic empiricist context, in view of revising currently used diagnostic manuals (DSM-IV and ICD-10), related discourses are proposed to focus upon doctor-patient relationship. This raises ontological (diagnostic, nosographical), epistemological (related to contexts, boundaries, and methods of psychiatric knowledge), and ethical questions (as per moral significance of both quality and fullness of doctor-patient relationship regarding outcomes of treatment administered), which, in their turn till now are either ignored or superficially dealt with by traditional biomedical -psychiatric in particular- philosophy.

However, stroke was already present in Charcot's first paper (1851), which dealt with a case of multiple organ cardiac embolism, including middle cerebral artery infarction, at a time when the studies of Rudolf Virchow on thromboembolism were unknown in France. A few years later, Charcot made a still up-to-date description of vascular intermittent claudication, which had only been reported in the horse. In the 1860s, Charcot and his pupils presented several major works dealing with cerebrovascular disease, including famous studies on miliary aneurysms in cerebral hemorrhage. This work was done with Charles Bouchard, at the time Charcot's 'interne', but who would become one of his 'political' opponents 2 decades later, when in 1892, as president of the 'agr\u00e9gation' jury, he rejected the professorship application of 4 prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of Charcot, including Joseph Babinski and Georges Gilles de la Tourette. Further work on cerebrovascular disease by Charcot included histological studies of brain 'softening', paraneoplastic cerebral arterial occlusion and consequences of stroke (e.g. arthropathies, vegetative changes, contractures and abnormal movements). Brain localization, one of Charcot's major neurological topics, was also largely based on stroke case studies.

We studied the significance of individual resource factors strengthening parents' resilience to long-term cancer-related distress, a focus that has rarely been used.\nThe two-nation Nordic sample included 398 parents; 190 of whom had experienced a child's cancer, and 208 reference parents. We studied the sense of coherence (SOC) using the SOC-13 questionnaire. For assessing distress reactions we used a primarily illness-specific 11-dimensional Parental Psychosocial Distress in Cancer (PPD-C) self-report questionnaire developed for use with parents of childhood cancer patients, and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Resilience was defined as absence of/less severe distress.\nLow SOC was significantly associated with more severe distress in all dimensions of the PPD-C and GHQ. The protective effect of SOC was indicated by it being most negatively related to general psychiatric symptoms, physical and psychological stress symptoms, anxiety and depression. The influence of SOC varied with parents' gender, showing a stronger modifying influence among mothers. Mothers and fathers also differed in their utilisation of professional psychosocial support when confronted with the child's cancer.\nParental resilience to cancer-related distress varies with identifiable strength factors. A strengths-oriented approach helps in understanding parental adjustment to childhood cancer. In order to counteract psychological vulnerability, addressing resilience instead of pathology helps to identify parents at risk and in need of professional support when faced with a child's cancer."}, {"Title": "The safety and tolerability of clozapine in aged patients: a retrospective clinical file review.", "Abstract": "A clinical file review was conducted of clozapine use in three aged psychiatry services in Melbourne, Australia, to compare its safety and tolerability with findings reported in the literature.\nThe review period spanned the intervals from 2008 to the services' origins between 11 and 15 years earlier. The files of all patients treated with clozapine during this period were checked with respect to adverse effects and the reasons for ceasing treatment.\nClozapine was prescribed to 75 patients (mean age 74.2 years, range 65-89) with doses ranging from 25-800 mg daily (mean 296 mg). Treatment was stopped within the review period in 37 (49%) cases. Reasons for discontinuation included death (n=14), non-fatal adverse events (n=12), patient choice (n=8) and other factors (n=3). While none of the 14 deaths could be linked directly to treatment, orthostatic hypotension might have contributed to a single fatal cerebrovascular accident. There were three cases of \"red alert\" leukopenia, none of which progressed to agranulocytosis. In general, side effects were more frequent than in a previous report concerning aged patients, most probably because clozapine doses were higher.

However, against this bland background of medicalization of what is clearly a poorly understood and complex multifactorial syndrome, innovative treatment approaches aimed at symptom control, in particular, the stress vulnerability model (SVM), have been developed. However, the SVM is an incomplete model of patient experience and says little of aetiological note. One area of psychological function that may give further insight into the symptom experience associated with schizophrenia within the context of stress vulnerability concerns the mechanisms of repression. Ironically, the notion of repression will for many represent the epitome of nonevidence-based psychiatric theory and related psychodynamic therapy practice. However, more contemporary work within the psychological literature has aimed to make the concept both measurable and observable. No longer occluded by the context of psychoanalysis, cognitive science accounts of repression may be of value in facilitating understanding of the variability and predictability of symptoms of schizophrenia and may provide a dimension of therapeutic engagement allied to the SVM."}, {"Title": "Pharmacoepidemiology of patients hospitalized for somatoform disorders in psychiatric hospitals and departments.", "Abstract": "Pharmacological treatment is used in patients with somatoform disorders (SD) although the empirical evidence is scarce.

The majority of physicians would not regularly discuss sexual orientation, sexual attraction, or gender identity while taking a sexual history from a sexually active adolescent. As well, the majority of physicians would not ask patients about sexual orientation if an adolescent presented with depression, suicidal thoughts, or had attempted suicide. If an adolescent stated that he or she was not sexually active, 41% of physicians reported that they would not ask additional sexual health-related questions. Only 57% agreed to an association between being a LGBTQ adolescent and suicide. The majority of physicians did not believe that they had all the skills they needed to address issues of sexual orientation with adolescents, and that sexual orientation should be addressed more often with these patients and in the course of training.

Exploratory regression analysis on physician's likelihood to restrain with independent variables of secondary diagnosis, patient age, sex, time of day, familiarity and trust with requesting nurse, patient behavior, vital signs, oxygen saturation, and dehydration explained 12.5% of variance (F=5.43, P<.001). Independent factors of unsafe patient behavior (P=.001) and secondary diagnosis of dementia (P=.06) resulted in greater likelihood of ordering restraint, whereas lack of trust in the judgment of the reporting nurse (P=.008) resulted in lower likelihood of ordering restraints.\nPatients' clinical status had less influence on physicians' likelihood of ordering physical restraints than the working relationship with the requesting nurse or the patient's behavior. Interdisciplinary team approaches with active physician input for nonrestraint strategies in the management of patient behavior is emphasized to minimize restraint use."}, {"Title": "Clinical experience using electroconvulsive therapy in adolescents with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adolescent patients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD).\nAll patients diagnosed with SSD who received ECT in the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychology Department in a general hospital in Barcelona, Spain, from January, 2003, to December, 2007, were identified retrospectively. As part of the usual evaluation protocol, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scales were administered before ECT, after the acute ECT phase (CGI), and at 6 months from baseline. Data related to characteristics of these patients such as demographics, pharmacological treatment, ECT parameters, and side effects were registered.\nThirteen cases, ages 13-17 (mean age, 16.6 +/- 1.2 years), were included. Compared to pre-ECT scores, mean PANSS decreased significantly at 6-month assessment (t = 3.58, p = 0.004). Clinical response (20% or greater reduction in PANSS total scores at the 6-month end point) was achieved in 54% of patients. A significant improvement of mean CGI score was observed after the acute ECT phase (t = 11.88, p < 0.001) and at 6-month assessment (t = 12.48, p < 0.001). There were no severe incidents related to any session during the acute ECT phase, although 1 patient experienced a tardive seizure during the continuation ECT.\nOur clinical experience supports the assertion that ECT is a safe and effective treatment for SSD in adolescent patients."}, {"Title": "[Therapy of psychological and behavioral symptoms in dementia].", "Abstract": "Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) represent a severe burden for patients and caregivers. The causes are disease-related neurobiological changes which increase the vulnerability to respond to external triggers with BPSD. Consequently, external factors (e.g. communication, milieu) are the primary target for treatment and also prevention of BPSD. Psychosocial interventions with the focus on the patient or on the caregivers are the core elements of BPSD therapy. If psychosocial interventions are not efficacious or only insufficiently applicable, pharmacological treatment may need to be initiated. Pharmacological treatment of BPSD has been less intensely investigated as treatment of cognition and function in dementia. However, recommendations can be given. This review follows the S3 guidelines on dementia published by the German Societies for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (DGPPN) and Neurology (DGN) which address BPSD extensively."}, {"Title": "[New procedures for recognition and differentiation of depression in immigrants.

Evaluation forms were used to elicit student opinions about the team-based learning sessions. Scores for trainee and faculty facilitators were compared using Student's t tests.\nOverall scores were positive, reflecting acceptability of this form of instruction.

Junior residents needed enhanced learning of clinical interviewing skills and learning connected to the inpatient psychiatry ward rotations, and senior residents needed opportunities to prepare for the specialty board exam and to develop teaching skills in preparation for attending positions. Changing the residency program structure and implementing a Teaching Resident rotation addressed these needs simultaneously.\nThe authors describe the responsibilities of the teaching resident, the role of the teaching resident in the program, and instruction in educational methods. Residents shared their perceptions of the new teaching resident rotation in an anonymous survey.\nPGY-1, PGY-2, and the PGY-4 residents found the teaching resident rotation helpful in many areas of their learning.\nService requirements were not compromised and highly valuable educational objectives were achieved for both the PGY-4 teaching residents and the PGY-1 and PGY-2 residents whom they taught.

The authors judged that an annual \"short-course\" review of medical knowledge would be a useful adjunct to standard seminar and rotation teaching, and that a resident-designed course might more closely meet resident-identified needs and learning styles.\nOur residency training program designed a formal summer short-course, called the Knowledge Base Review (KBR), with the hypothesis that the course would improve general knowledge as measured by the Psychiatry Resident-in-Training Examination (PRITE) and with the objective that this program would enrich the residents' general knowledge base in psychiatry and neurology. The authors designed the KBR as a weekly curriculum composed of nine 2-hour sessions, each equally didactic- and active learning-based. The first hour spotlighted one of the subscales of the PRITE. The second hour used a question and answer test in which four teams of residents competed to answer in game show style. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of the KBR was conducted.\nAttendance among the PGY-2, -3, and -4 classes was 82%, 73%, and 94%, respectively. Participating residents completed a survey midway through the KBR. Ninety-five percent responded that the course was meeting their own expectations \"all\" and \"most of the time,\" 100% responded that the didactic component was useful, and 94% felt that the game show component was useful. Among 23 residents who took the PRITE in the year prior to and the year after the KBR, there was a 2.6% increase in PRITE global psychiatry scores (p=0.15) in contrast to a 9.0% decline in global neurology scores (p=0.001), which was not addressed in the KBR.\nThe broad participation and acceptability of the course and the performance difference in PRITE scores between the psychiatry topics, the majority of which were reviewed, and neurology, which was not reviewed, suggest the potential for such a resident-organized and -led intervention to impact acquisition of medical knowledge through an enjoyable and effective approach."}, {"Title": "The Education Chief Resident in Medical Student Education: indicators of success.", "Abstract": "Although residents are actively involved in teaching medical students, some students do not feel that they get adequate teaching from residents.

Studies of suicide risk have not found consistent relationship to the noradrenaline metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxphenylglycol (MHPG) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Non-suppression in the dexamethasone test (DST) has been associated with increased risk of suicide in depressed patients. The study sample consisted of 51 mood disorder inpatients admitted to the Department of Psychiatry at the Karolinska University Hospital between 1980 and 2000. Patients underwent lumbar punction and DST and were followed up for the cause of death. The hypothesis was that both CSF MHPG and HPA axis dysregulation are associated with suicidal behaviour. Nine suicide victims had significantly lower CSF MHPG and baseline plasma cortisol than survivors. Using both CSF MHPG and baseline cortisol in ROC analysis for suicide prediction, the positive predictive value was 44% and the area under the curve was 0.88. In conclusion, lower CSF MHPG was associated with suicide risk. Furthermore these results suggest that combined measures of noradrenergic system and HPA axis function may offer better prediction of suicide risk."}, {"Title": "Mental health policy and development in Egypt - integrating mental health into health sector reforms 2001-9.", "Abstract": "Following a situation appraisal in 2001, a six year mental health reform programme (Egymen) 2002-7 was initiated by an Egyptian-Finnish bilateral aid project at the request of a former Egyptian minister of health, and the work was incorporated directly into the Ministry of Health and Population from 2007 onwards.

The goal of the present study is systematically to assess the kind of contacts that take place and their quality with a survey of physicians in private practice. A further goal is to determine whether alternatives to current practices can be envisioned.\n100 physicians in each of three specialties (neurology/psychiatry, general medicine, and cardiology) were surveyed with a questionnaire containing 37 questions. 208 (69.3%) questionnaires were anonymously filled out and returned.\n77% (n = 160) of all physicians were visited by PSR at least once a week, and 19% (n = 39) every day. Pharmaceutical samples, items of office stationery and free lunches were the most commonly received gifts. 49% (n = 102) stated that they only occasionally, rarely, or never receive adequate information from PSR, and 76% (n = 158) stated that PSR often or always wanted to influence their prescribing patterns. Only 6% (n = 13) considered themselves to be often or always influenced, while 21% (n = 44) believed this of their colleagues. The physicians generally did not believe that PSR visits and drug company-sponsored educational events delivered objective information, in contrast to medical texts and non-sponsored educational events. Nonetheless, 52% (n = 108) of the physicians would regret the cessation of PSR visits, because PSRs give practical prescribing information, offer support for continuing medical education, and provide pharmaceutical samples.\nPSR visits and attempts to influence physicians' prescribing behavior are a part of everyday life in private medical practice, yet only a few physicians consider themselves to be susceptible to this kind of influence. A more critical attitude among physicians, and the creation of alternative educational events without drug company sponsoring, might lead to more independence and perhaps to more rational and less costly drug-prescribing practices."}, {"Title": "Complementary and alternative medicine in major depressive disorder: the American Psychiatric Association Task Force report.", "Abstract": "To review selected complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD).\nAuthors of this report were invited participants in the American Psychiatric Association's Task Force on Complementary and Alternative Medicine.\nThe group reviewed the literature on individual CAM treatments for MDD, methodological considerations, and future directions for CAM in psychiatry.

Written iterations were drafted and sent out among group members prior to discussion, resolution of any differences of interpretation of evidence, and final approval.\nA review of randomized controlled trials for commonly used CAM treatments such as omega-3 fatty acids, St John's wort (Hypericum), folate, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), acupuncture, light therapy, exercise, and mindfulness psychotherapies revealed promising results. More rigorous and larger studies are recommended. Each CAM treatment must be evaluated separately in adequately powered controlled trials.

However, it is well known that dopamine-mediated neurotransmission imbalance is associated with this pathology and the main target of antipsychotics is the dopamine receptor D2. Recently, it was described alteration in levels of two dopamine signaling related proteins in schizophrenic prefrontal cortex (PFC): Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS-1) and DARPP-32. NCS-1, which is upregulated in PFC of schizophrenics, inhibits D2 internalization. DARPP-32, which is decreased in PFC of schizophrenics, is a key downstream effector in transducing dopamine signaling. We previously demonstrated that antipsychotics do not change levels of both proteins in rat's brain. However, since NCS-1 and DARPP-32 levels are not altered in wild type rats, we treated wild type PC12 cells (PC12 WT) and PC12 cells stably overexpressing NCS-1 (PC12 Clone) with antipsychotics to investigate if NCS-1 upregulation modulates DARPP-32 expression in response to antipsychotics treatment.\nWe chronically treated both PC12 WT and PC12 Clone cells with typical (Haloperidol) or atypical (Clozapine and Risperidone) antipsychotics for 14 days. Using western blot technique we observed that there is no change in NCS-1 and DARPP-32 protein levels in both PC12 WT and PC12 Clone cells after typical and atypical antipsychotic treatments.\nBecause we observed no alteration in NCS-1 and DARPP-32 levels in both PC12 WT and Clone cells treated with typical or atypical antipsychotics, we suggest that the alteration in levels of both proteins in schizophrenic's PFC is related to psychopathology but not with antipsychotic treatment."}, {"Title": "Ethnic disparities in accessing treatment for depression and substance use disorders in an integrated health plan.", "Abstract": "This study examined ethnic differences in accessing treatment for depression and substance use disorders (SUDs) among men and women in a large integrated health plan, and explored factors potentially contributing to health care disparities.\nParticipants were 22,543 members ages 20 to 65 who responded to health surveys in 2002 and 2005.

It is also perfectly suited to the well established outpatient model practised in general practice and psychiatry. All GP practices should include people with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder on their case register of people with severe mental illness. It is not possible to exclude a bipolar diagnosis categorically if there are only symptoms of depression. Most patients will have had a (hypo)manic episode by their 30s. The lifetime prevalence of bipolar affective disorder proper is 1%, with a further 1.2% presenting with milder hypomanic symptoms (so-called bipolar II disorder). Relaxing diagnostic symptom criteria increases the frequency of depressed patients who develop symptoms of mania for any length of time to 50%. The lifetime course of the illness tends to be dominated by depressive episodes: half the time is estimated to be spent in the euthymic (well) state, 12% in a manic state and 38% in a depressed state. Any depressed patient should be asked about periods in the past when (s)he has been elated in mood, found it unnecessary to sleep, talked a lot, spent excessive amounts of money etc. Treatment for bipolar disorder has to be divided into: treatment of mania, treatment of bipolar depression and prophylaxis of mood swings in either direction. Antidepressant treatments are unlikely to help manic symptoms, at worst they can precipitate or aggravate them. Antimanic treatments are unlikely to help symptoms of depression but an exception to this rule would be a genuine mood stabiliser, such as lithium. Patients with bipolar disorder should have an annual physical health review. This will include monitoring for weight gain, lipid levels, plasma glucose levels, smoking status and alcohol use, as well as blood pressure."}, {"Title": "Attempted suicide, by mail order: Abrus precatorius.", "Abstract": "Abrus precatorius is cultivated in many subtropical areas. The seeds exist in a variety of colors such as black, orange, and most commonly, glossy red. A black band is found at the end of the seed. The plant contains multiple pods which typically contain three to five Abrus seeds. The seeds contain abrin, which inhibits ribosomal function, halting protein synthesis and leading to cellular death. A unique aspect of this case is the use of the internet to order a potentially lethal poison as well as transmission of a picture to identify the seed.\nA 20-year-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of vomiting and watery diarrhea for 6-8\u00a0h prior to arrival. He denied any medication use, recent illness, travel, or changes in his diet. Initial vital signs were normal. The patient was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis. During his evaluation, the patient admitted to feeling suicidal. While awaiting psychiatry evaluation, the patient's father arrived with a box of small hard red seeds, which he believed that his son ingested in a suicide attempt. The seeds could not be identified by the staff. A picture of the seeds was transmitted by e-mail to the New York City Poison Control Center, allowing their identification as A. precatorius. The patient was reinterviewed and admitted to chewing and swallowing 10 seeds. Given the potential toxicity of abrin, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. He continued to have frequent episodes of emesis as well as diarrhea. He gradually improved over 2\u00a0days. He admitted to ordering a box of Abrus seeds online from Asia after reading on the Internet about their use in suicide. He was eventually discharged for outpatient follow-up with no permanent sequelae.\nAbrin has an estimated human fatal dose of 0.1-1\u00a0\u03bcg/kg. Most cases of Abrus seed ingestions are unintentional and occur in children. Ingesting the intact seeds typically results in no clinical findings, as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract due to their hard shell. Abrin released during chewing is poorly absorbed systemically from the gastrointestinal tract. This causes the vomiting and diarrhea with resultant hypovolemia and electrolyte disturbances, which can be severe and life threatening, particularly in areas with less advanced health care systems.

Treatment resistance remains a serious psychiatric problem. One of the reasons for that is that the pendulum has swung from a psychodynamic framework to a biological one, and the impact of meaning (i.e. the role of psychodynamic and psychosocial factors in treatment-refractory illness) has been relatively neglected. Dynamic factors in psychopharmacology play a pivotal role in pharmacological treatment responsiveness. There is a small but impressive evidence base that shows that psychological and interpersonal factors play that role.

A high proportion of patients in forensic psychiatric facilities are diagnosed with comorbidity, most often with schizophrenia, paranoid psychosis, organic brain syndrome, various personality disorders and comorbid substance abuse. These patients represent a high risk group for violence within forensic psychiatric facilities, and repetitive violent behavior in the community. Understanding the neurobiological basis of aggressive behavior clearly has important social and clinical implications. By introduction of neuroimaging studies (MRI, fMRI, PET, SPECT) as a useful tool in forensic psychiatry, the neurobiological aspect of violence is better understood. Previous studies have shown that individuals with frontotemporal brain dysfunction are frequently displaying antisocial behavior (disinhibition, impulsivity, lack of empathy) that justify the diagnosis of \"acquired sociopathy/psychopathy\". A correlation between the potential for impulsive aggression mediated by limbic brain structures, and the control of the aggression by frontotemporal brain regions has been shown. The individuals with such brain dysfunction have an increased risk of violent behavior and scored high on the Webster's and Hare's violence risk assessment scale. This article reviews the relationship between psychiatric comorbidity, violence risk assessment and neuroimaging in forensic psychiatry and showing the useful directions for future research, screening and prevention of violent behavior among mentally ill criminal offenders."}, {"Title": "Comorbidity, multimorbidity and personalized psychosomatic medicine: epigenetics rolling on the horizon.", "Abstract": "This review focuses first on conceptual chaos and different connotations in psychosomatic medicine, then on new perspectives on comorbidity and multimorbidity, especially from epigenetics perspective. Comorbidity is one of the greatest research and clinical challenges to contemporary psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine. Recently altered gene expression due to epigenetic regulation has been implicated in the development of multifarious mental disorders and somatic diseases. The potential relevance of epigenetics for better understanding and more successful treatment of comorbidity and multimorbidity is described."}, {"Title": "New image of psychiatry, mass media impact and public relations.", "Abstract": "The mass media has a powerful impact on public attitudes about mental health and psychiatry. The question of identity of psychiatry as a medical profession as well as of the future of psychiatry has been the subject of much controversial discussion. Psychiatry today has the historical opportunity to shape the future of mental health care, medicine and society. It has gained in scientific and professional status by the tremendous increase of knowledge and treatment skills. Psychiatry should build up new transdisciplinary and integrative image of a specialized profession, promote it and make it public. Good public relations are very important for the future of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Clinician-assisted Internet-based treatment is effective for panic: A randomized controlled trial.", "Abstract": "To determine the efficacy of an Internet-based clinician-assisted cognitive behavioural treatment program (the Panic program) for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia).\nFifty-nine individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia were randomly assigned to a treatment group or to a waitlist control group. Treatment group participants completed the Panic program, comprising six on-line lessons, weekly homework assignments, received weekly email contact from a psychiatry registrar, and contributed to a moderated online discussion forum with other participants. An intention-to-treat model was used for data analyses.\nTwenty-three (79%) of treatment group participants completed all lessons within the 8-week program, and post-treatment data were collected from 22/29 treatment group and 22/25 waitlist group participants. Compared to the control group, treatment group participants reported significantly reduced symptoms of panic as measured by the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, Body Sensation Questionnaire, and Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaires. Significant reductions were also reported on measures of disability and depression. The mean within- and between-group effect size (Cohen's d) on the Panic Disorder Severity Scale was 0.93 and 0.59, respectively, and effects were sustained at 1-month follow-up.

In particular, a T/C change (rs1801260) at the 3111 position of the circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) gene has been explored in psychiatry disorders. This meta-analysis has been undertaken to investigate the association between rs1801260 and both mood disorders and depression severity, shedding light on previous controversial results and providing better power to detect smaller effect sizes. PubMed and ISI databases were searched for studies focused on the association between rs1801260 and mood disorders spectrum. Quality of studies was assessed. We found no association between CLOCK genotypes and mood disorders, even when we separately investigated ethnical homogeneous or unipolar disorder studies. No association was found regarding severity of depression either. The methodological quality of the studies has been found to be medium-high. Our meta-analysis shows no association between rs1801260 and mood disorders (as a complete phenotype) or depression severity and points out the necessity of further research in order to better understand the underlying biological machinery of circadian dysfunction in subjects affected by mood disorders."}, {"Title": "Female arsonists: key features, psychopathologies, and treatment needs.", "Abstract": "Female-perpetrated arson is a topic that has received relatively little research attention from either psychiatrists or psychologists. In this review, available research regarding the characteristics, psychopathologies, and current treatment efforts with female arsonists is reviewed. Evaluation of current research with female arsonists suggests that very few researchers have compared female arsonists either to suitable female offender control groups or male arsons. Consequently, clinical knowledge and practice regarding female-perpetrated arson is underdeveloped relative to both other areas of forensic-clinical psychiatry and to knowledge of male arsonists. Suggestions are made for translating current research into arson interventions with female arsonists.

Patients searched for a single randomly positioned target amongst distractors displayed for 3\u00a0s. After training patients demonstrated significantly shorter reaction times for search stimuli (Pambakian et al. in J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 75:1443-1448, 2004). In this study, patients achieved improved search efficiency after training by altering their oculomotor behaviour in the following ways: (1) patients directed a higher proportion of fixations into the hemispace containing the target, (2) patients were quicker to saccade into the hemifield containing the target if the initial saccade had been made into the opposite hemifield, (3) patients made fewer transitions from one hemifield to another before locating the target, (4) patients made a larger initial saccade, although the direction of the initial saccade did not change as a result of training, (5) patients acquired a larger visual lobe in their blind hemifield after training. Patients also required fewer saccades to locate the target after training reflecting improved search efficiency. All these changes were confined to the training period and maintained at follow-up. Taken together these results suggest that visual training facilitates the development of specific compensatory eye movement strategies in patients with homonymous visual field defects."}, {"Title": "Vulnerability, life events and depression amongst Moslem Malaysian women: comparing those married and those divorced or separated.", "Abstract": "The experiences of married and single mothers were compared in an investigation of psychosocial vulnerability, stress and depression in a community-based study of Moslem mothers in Malaysia. For the first time, a model of vulnerability-provoking agent originally developed by Brown et al. in the UK was tested in a Malaysian context.\nA cross-sectional study was carried out in the district of Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Of the 1,200 women approached from membership of community associations, 1,002 (84%) completed the questionnaires. Severe life events Recent Life Events Questionnaire (Brugha and Cragg in Acta Psychiatr Scand 82:77-81, 1990) and psychosocial vulnerability (VDQ) (Moran et al. in Br J Clin Psychol 40:411-427, 2001) were used to measure vulnerability factors.

Genome-wide association studies have identified a number of common polymorphisms robustly associated with schizophrenia, in ZNF804A, transcription factor 4, major histocompatibility complex, and neurogranin. In addition, copy number variants (CNVs) in 1q21.1, 2p16.3, 15q11.2, 15q13.3, 16p11.2, and 22q11.2 were convincingly implicated in schizophrenia risk. Furthermore, these studies have suggested considerable genetic overlap with bipolar disorder (particularly for common polymorphisms) and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism (particularly for CNVs). The influence of these risk variants on relevant intermediate phenotypes needs further study. In addition, there is a need for etiological models of psychosis integrating genetic risk with environmental factors associated with the disorder, focusing specifically on environmental impact on gene expression (epigenetics) and convergence of genes and environment on common biological pathways bringing about larger effects than those of genes or environment in isolation (gene-environment interaction).

We describe a case of chloroform ingestion with a confirmatory serum level and resultant hepatotoxicity successfully treated with intravenously administered N-acetylcysteine (NAC). A 19-year-old man attempting suicide ingested approximately 75 mL of chloroform. He was unresponsive and intubated upon arrival. Intravenously administered NAC was started after initial stabilization was complete. His vital signs were normal. Admission laboratory values revealed normal serum electrolytes, AST, ALT, PT, BUN, creatinine, and bilirubin. Serum ethanol level was 15 mg/dL, and aspirin and acetaminophen were undetectable. The patient was extubated but developed liver function abnormalities with a peak AST of 224 IU/L, ALT of 583 IU/L, and bilirubin level reaching 16.3 mg/dL. NAC was continued through hospital day 6. Serum chloroform level obtained on admission was 91 \u03bcg/mL. The patient was discharged to psychiatry without known sequelae and normal liver function tests. The average serum chloroform level in fatal cases of inhalational chloroform poisoning was 64 \u03bcg/mL, significantly lower than our patient. The toxicity is believed to be similar in both inhalation and ingestion routes of exposure, with mortality predominantly resulting from anoxia secondary to central nervous system depression. Hepatocellular toxicity is thought to result from free radical-induced oxidative damage. Previous reports describe survival after treatment with orally administered NAC, we report the first use of intravenously administered NAC for chloroform ingestion. Acute oral ingestion of chloroform is extremely rare. Our case illustrates that with appropriate supportive care, patients can recover from chloroform ingestion, and intravenously administered NAC may be of benefit in such cases."}, {"Title": "Protecting the prominent?

It is noted that data in US studies do not differ greatly from those in UK studies, but rather their interpretation. The practical benefits of attending to the factors in question are illustrated by reference to the activities of the United Kingdom's Fixated Threat Assessment Centre.

The critiques of the psychiatrist as expert in the criminal justice systems produced by Michel Foucault, and Robert Musil provide a starting point for this study. Today's mental health experts working in the criminal justice field have an increasing burden of responsibility as a result of their wider role, and potentially greater power to harm. This requires an awareness of the dangers of misusing that power in part from misunderstanding its source. The expert's legitimacy stems from the knowledge they mediate. In psychiatry, we have an important, but limited, body of relevant quantitative scientific data coupled to a mass of qualitative observations with which we fill the gaps and construct our professional narratives. Confusing the science with the poetry makes us foolish and even more open to manipulation by authorities pursuing legal, governmental and populist agenda. The choices that face us lie between being a 'forensicist', tied to the legal discourse, or a being a physician, committed to mediating medical science and clinical experience.

Poor knowledge about childhood autism among final year medical, nursing and psychology students who would form tomorrow's child health care professionals can compromise early recognition and interventions that are known to improve prognosis in childhood autism. Educational factors that could be influencing knowledge about childhood autism among these future health care professionals are unknown. This study assessed knowledge about childhood autism among final year undergraduate medical, nursing and psychology students in south-eastern Nigeria and determined the factors that could be influencing such knowledge.\nOne hundred final year undergraduate students were randomly selected from each of the Departments of Medicine, Nursing Science and Psychology respectively of University of Nigeria, Enugu State, Nigeria making a sample size of three hundred.

I begin with a scandal that erupted in Jamaica and suggest that this set in motion processes that led to critical changes in asylum administration. The first of these processes was an audit of hospitals and asylums in the colonies. The results of the audit and the policy that emerged from it marked the beginning of systematic regulation of lunatic asylum practice across the British Empire. It revealed a formulation of policy that was intended to cut across the self-governing regimes that had up to this point been allowed to evolve. Drawing on the work of Michel Foucault and Nikolas Rose, I argue that the policy and the practices associated with it contribute to an understanding of the emergence of the psy-sciences in colonial settings. They illustrate the establishment of a panoptic gaze on previously neglected insane spaces. Systematic surveillance constituted government at a distance and made colonial lunacy administration a governable discursive space. The regulation of the medical officers, lunatic attendants, and hospital boards began the process of creating a professional psychiatric workforce. I conclude with a discussion of the implications and the mixed impact of this policy change for the mentally ill across the empire, over the ensuing decades."}, {"Title": "Cranial Nerves IX, X, XI, and XII.", "Abstract": "This article concludes the series on cranial nerves, with review of the final four (IX-XII). To summarize briefly, the most important and common syndrome caused by a disorder of the glossopharyngeal nerve (craniel nerve IX) is glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Also, swallowing function occasionally is compromised in a rare but disabling form of tardive dyskinesia called tardive dystonia, because the upper motor portion of the glossopharyngel nerve projects to the basal ganglia and can be affected by lesions in the basal ganglia. Vagus nerve funtion (craniel nerve X) can be compromised in schizophrenia, bulimia, obesity, and major depression. A cervical lesion to the nerve roots of the spinal accessory nerve (craniel nerve XI) can cause a cervical dystonia, which sometimes is misdiagnosed as a dyskinesia related to neuroleptic use. Finally, unilateral hypoglossal (craniel nerve XII) nerve palsy is one of the most common mononeuropathies caused by brain metastases. Supranuclear lesions of cranial nerve XII are involved in pseudobulbar palsy and ALS, and lower motor neuron lesions of cranial nerve XII can also be present in bulbar palsy and in ALS patients who also have lower motor neuron involvement.

In the United Kingdom, physical intervention techniques migrated from the prison service in the mid 1980s where there was extensive use of two particularly controversial practices; 'pain compliance' and the 'prone restraint position'. This paper examines how the classification of the 'prone restraint position' has led to a narrowed focus on one technique and a resultant misunderstanding around the wider risks associated with the applying force and managing restraints. The paper goes on to propose the 'transitional stabilizing position' (TSP) as an alternative concept and puts forward a dynamic risk assessment model. It explores how a shift in staff training away from developing pure competence in the performance of tightly specified techniques to managing the patient in TSPs could conceivably reduce the relatively low risk of death or serious injury associated with the application of restraint techniques to an even lower level."}, {"Title": "Service user involvement and the restrictive sense of psychiatric categories: the challenge facing mental health nurses.", "Abstract": "The active involvement of those people who have at one time used, or who continue to use, mental health services has come to be seen as a central feature of both the policy and the practice of modern mental health care. However, while those people who use mental health services may face a variety of obstacles to active participation in their care and in the provision of mental health services more generally, this paper will draw on the work of Gilles Deleuze, arguably one of the most important philosophers of the late 20th century, to suggest that the language of psychiatry--and, in particular, the attendant valuations or 'sense' of psychiatry's diagnostic categories--serve to restrict the participation of people in their individual care and in the provision of mental health services. Accordingly, it will be suggested that the challenge, as well as the opportunity, that confronts mental health nurses is to facilitate greater, more active user participation by practising in a manner that elicits the resources, capabilities and potential that service users possess, thereby challenging the prevailing and restrictive sense of the diagnostic categories by which people are identified, and by which they come to identify themselves."}, {"Title": "Ethics and professionalism preparation for psychiatrists-in-training: A curricular proposal.", "Abstract": "Potential ethical issues and challenges to professionalism arise commonly in the care of patients with psychiatric illnesses.

High ethical standards are especially important in psychiatry in which several unique challenges present due to a vulnerable patient population, intimate physician-patient relationships, diagnoses made on signs and symptoms rather than irrefutable laboratory investigations, and therapeutic options directed at altering thinking and behaviour. It is critical that psychiatric training equip practitioners with the ability to identify ethical dilemmas in clinical practice and research and respond appropriately. Despite a call to action and the development of guidelines for ethical practice by several regulatory bodies, formal ethics teaching in psychiatry training programmes is still in embryonic stages in the developed world and virtually non-existent in the developing world. Here we highlight the current status of bioethics teaching in psychiatry residency programmes in Pakistan, an example of a developing country where such training is vital, as unethical practices abound in resource-poor settings where clinical and research practices are non-transparent and there are no effective regulatory, legal and accountability bodies.

We study the situation where processes are selected for study if an event occurs in a certain selection interval. Motivation comes from psychiatric epidemiology where repeated hospital admissions are studied for patients with affective disease, as seen in Kessing et al. (Acta Psychiatr Scand 109:339-344, 2004b). For the selected processes, either only disease course from selection and onwards is used in the analysis, or, both retrospective and prospective disease course histories are used. We examine two methods to correct for the selection depending on which data are used in the analysis. In the first case, the conditional distribution of the process given the pre-selection history is determined. In the second case, an inverse-probability-of-selection weighting scheme is suggested. The ability of the methods to correct for the bias due to selection is investigated with simulations.

The psychopathological profile comprises symptoms from the affective, schizophrenic, and cognitive domains and the prevalence varies between 2% to 20%. Classification of such conditions is performed according to their temporal relationship with the seizure itself. Although it is well known that epilepsy may be associated with psychotic disorders, it is less widely recognized that relapsing psychotic phenomena may be the first and only symptom of epilepsy. In this research, two patients are described who were initially referred for recurrent episodes of bipolar affective disorder and schizophrenic psychosis, respectively. In both patients, a diagnosis of relapsing postictal psychotic states due to previously undiagnosed epilepsy was made and consequently, treatment with antiepileptics was started. During follow up over several months, they remained free of both epileptic and psychotic symptoms. Given the kaleidoscopic nature of the postictal psychosis and full recovery from this, such psychoses best meet the criteria for a cycloid psychosis. These observations illustrate diagnostic and therapeutic pitfalls due to the conceptual disintegration emerging from the inadequate separation between psychiatry and neurology.

Longer-acting stimulants are thus considered as first-line for management of ADHD symptoms. Over the years, concerns about the abuse potential of stimulants have led to the development of alternative formulations of these agents. One such recent development, lisdexamfetamine (LDX) was FDA approved for treating ADHD in children in early 2007 and in adults in early 2008. LDX is a prodrug, which when orally ingested, is converted to l- lysine and active d-amphetamine, which is responsible for its therapeutic activity. This unique formulation may lead to a possible reduction of the abuse potential, by bypassing the first-pass metabolism. In fact, a statistically significant difference for the 'liking' effects on the Drug Questionnaire Response has been reported with intravenous LDX compared to d-amphetamine. LDX appears to have an efficacy and tolerability profile comparable to other extended-release stimulant formulations used to treat ADHD, but reduced potential for abuse-related liking effects when compared to equivalent amounts of immediate-release d-amphetamine.

Such a call, however, prompts the question of what kind of additional element this is. Just what is meant by idiographic understanding and how, exactly, does it complement, by being distinct from, other elements within psychiatric diagnostic judgement? The first half of this paper continues discussion from an earlier paper [Thornton: Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci 2008;258 (suppl 5):104-109] to consider the idea, inspired by Wilhelm Windelband's rectoral address of 1894, that idiographic judgement is distinct because it is a special kind of 'individualised' judgement about individuals. I argue, however, that the most promising interpretation of this idea falls prey to Wilfrid Sellars argument against the Myth of the Given and thus it cannot be a genuine complement to criteriological diagnosis. In addition to this idea, however, 'idiographic' has also been used to label narrative judgement. The second half of the paper highlights how narrative judgement, shorn of any connection to metaphysical theories of the self, is an essentially normative form of judgement that contrasts with, and can thus complement, criteriological diagnosis."}, {"Title": "Measuring outcomes in outpatient child psychiatry: the contribution of electronic technologies and parent report.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of electronic technologies on the completion of a standardized rating form in an outpatient child psychiatry clinic, and the feasibility of adding a parent-report measure to the form.

A general practitioners' postal survey in the north-west region of France].", "Abstract": "Depression is a quite common condition, and its treatment is mainly provided by General Practitioner (GP). It is already known that detection and treatment requires significant improvement. The well known and high consumption of antidepressant drugs in France, the highest of all other European countries, requires specific studies. The causes of this situation are not clear and seem to be numerous: Patient's demands, social claims; lack of initial and continuous medical education, bad GP demographic trends, and lack of them in rural areas; pharmaceutical company pressure; and organisation of the health care system. GP are the main medical actors of the primary care system in France. The aim of this study was to survey GP perceptions on secondary care services, seek the views and barriers to the provision of good services, and ask them about perceptions and solutions they could suggest.\nA structured postal questionnaire was sent to all GP of the north-west region of France, asking physicians about obstacles perceived when taking care of depressive patients; factors influencing the use of services, specialised advice, treatments, access to psychiatrists and psychological care. Their psychiatric knowledge and demographic data were also assessed. Quantitative data were analysed using Epi-Info software, and qualitative data were transcribed and coded manually.\nA total of 25% of the GP returned the questionnaire (n=2097 in 8709). The sample profile was the same as the studied population. Less than a third of the GP (28%) were aware of the clinical guidelines on depression, and less than a fifth (18%) had clinical experience of psychiatry during their studies. Lack of time was not the main obstacle assessed by the GP. Their complaints were about lack of mental health services, difficulty in accessing services, and about general liaison between primary and secondary health care services: they reported difficulties obtaining quick and good response from the specialist either for emergency or non emergency cases. Regarding secondary care, they mainly referred to the psychiatrist, rather than to the psychologist, probably because this second option is not reimbursed by the social security system. Not surprisingly, medication was cited as the most frequently used treatment, followed by psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and almost never self help literature and self help groups. Trained GP considered they were much more comfortable coping with depressed patients, less frequently using secondary care providers, and easily alternative solutions rather than antidepressant drugs. This situation suggests the usefulness of medical education, and is attested by many qualitative answers.\nIt is not sure that the low rate of knowledge of the guidelines should be judged only as a lack of professionalism. According to the \"French Society of Primary Care\", clinical guidelines need updating, and it is known that those available could be useful only for half of the situations encountered in primary care. Operational propositions urgently need to be proposed. Recent questioning of the real interest of pharmaceutical options in the treatment of depression is another argument. Nor can we wait for a hypothetic rise in the demographic situation. The GP have several propositions to improve these problems, e.g. continuous medical education (CME) focusing on \"patient centred therapy\", dedicated hotline or circuit for depressed people, and an adapted sociomedical directory. They also feel that political awareness about lack of physicians is required, but say that improving quality of care does not rely only on improving demographics. They ask for funds for psychological care. When thinking about the circuit of care, the role of all care providers, and their communication, a global vision appears unavoidable, which would get rid of the divisions between out-patients and the hospital.\nDespite an unavoidable questioning on the dysfunctions of the health care system, quality of care and probably pharmaceutical consumption for the depressed patient might be improved by simple tools, such as adapted CME for primary care physicians, and communication improvement between secondary and primary care systems."}, {"Title": "[Descriptive study of suicidal adolescents conducted in Abidjan].", "Abstract": "The answer to the various problems encountered during adolescence is experienced in the form of behavioural thoughts and/or action expressed in conduct.

Because of the obligation for the doctors to perform an evaluation of their professional practices, a proposition to use a method presented by the High Authority of Health was looked for. Considering the necessity of favoring the exchanges between team members, the articulation of two methods was proposed: a morbidity mortality review (MMR) and an analysis of the detailed causes. The objective of the MMR is to analyze the deaths of certain predetermined morbid accidents within a service. The aim of the MMR is to highlight actions for improvement. The analysis of the causes allows the professionals to list all the causes of the problem identified, without limiting themselves to the immediate causes. In this case, a simple method was chosen: the Ishikawa diagram (or fishbone diagram, or also cause-and-effect diagram).\nA specific Ishikawa diagram for suicide was created by the coordinating physician and was proposed to the team. In the term of the first MMR, the tool was improved by the collective clinical experience and served as support of analysis for the studied events. Three cases related to the evaluation were prepared beforehand by the referent doctor and later presented by him in MMR sessions. For each case, approximately a dozen of professionals were invited to fill in the biography of the patient. A discussion was then engaged by the external doctor on the circumstances of self injuries or suicide attempts. The three detailed analyses of cases were transcribed into a virgin Ishikawa diagram. Furthermore, several points were discussed on the safety aspects (diversion of the possessions with suicidal aim, and importance of the \"almost incident\") and on the interest in exchanging on the current and\\or local professional practices (exchange on tools possibly used in the other psychiatric health establishments; favor the training). The actions of improvement put in perspective mainly concerned the professional practices. In this particular case, the awareness of professional knowledge was the most sought by the ancillary medical members of the team.\nWe observed an important investment of the team, as far as the MMR bases are concerned, on a shared clinical method. The participants easily got to grips with the tool. The initiation with the MMR tool was time consuming, in particular for the doctor coordinating the project and the referent doctor of the department (30 hours). The exchanges also permitted the assessment of the competence of each professional present, and the common priorities were fast identified and focused on sharing the professional practices. The intervention of an external speaker (doctor, qualitician or other) seems important since it favors the emergence of questionings in the team.\nWhen faced with unwanted events such as suicides or suicide attempts, the MMR method allows the care teams to have time to ponder, listen and argument. What is learnt from dealing with unexpected events should enable the collective development of the capacity to react with the right reflexes when a surprising situation occurs. The RMM should find a place in the systems of clinical risk management, as a supplement to the declaration of the incidence. The results make it possible to anticipate on the use of the MMR in other thematic studies or issues of risk management."}, {"Title": "Safeguarding children's rights in psychopharmacological research: ethical and legal issues.", "Abstract": "Research on psychopharmacological treatment in children and adolescents is the subject of ongoing ethical discussion, as minors with mental disorders constitute a vulnerable patient group.

The objective of the present paper is to offer an overview of economic evaluations of child psychiatric drug treatment. Major electronic databases, as well as abstract booklets from international clinical and health economics conferences with an external peer review process, were examined to search for comparative economic evaluations of child and adolescent psychiatric drug treatment. Most studies of pharmacotreatment were cost effectiveness analyses (CEAs) concerned with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Three evaluations were done by or on behalf of agencies as part of ADHD-related health technology assessments. A number of economic studies used patient-level data from specific randomized clinical trials, especially the NIMH-initiated MTA (in childhood ADHD) and TADS (in adolescent major depression) studies. Almost all studies relied on narrow scale symptom scales to assess effects of treatment, even when quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were reported. In many cases, effectiveness data came from short-term studies, and extrapolation to a one-year time horizon was usually based on assumptions. Even those evaluations attempting to address longer time horizons by way of modeling did not include the impact of treatment on long-term sequelae of the conditions studied, mainly due to a paucity of robust clinical data. Nevertheless, currently available health economic evaluations broadly suggest an acceptable to attractive cost effectiveness of medication management of ADHD, whereas there is no such evidence for child psychiatric disorders other than ADHD."}, {"Title": "Consultant psychiatrists' experience of workplace violence - a national survey.", "Abstract": "In recent years there have been a number of high profile cases in Irish psychiatry where consultant psychiatrists have been subjected to serious physical assaults. The last survey of assaults on consultant psychiatrists in Ireland was carried out in 1998. Therefore we sought to update the data on this topic.\nAn anonymous questionnaire was sent out by post to all consultant psychiatrists (n = 330) identified as currently working in the Republic of Ireland.\nThe response rate was 48.2%. Sixty per cent of respondents were working in general adult psychiatry and respondents were evenly spread throughout the country. Ninety per cent of respondents had been the victim of verbal aggression/intimidation/threatening behaviour while 55% had been physically assaulted. The majority of incidents involved male patients aged between 21-40 years with a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. Nearly 66% of incidents of physical violence occurred during a relapse of illness. The perpetrator had a history of violence in approximately half of all reported incidents. Physical assaults tended to occur more commonly in inpatient settings (63.7%). Incident reporting occurred more often in physical assaults with 66% reported informally to colleagues and 20% reported to An Garda Siochana (police force of Ireland). Eighty-nine (56%) consultants described feeling 'safe' at work. Less than 50% reported the provision of standard safety equipment in the workplace and nearly half ofrespondents had not attended any safety training courses since their appointment. Longer experience working as a consultant psychiatrist did not appear to have an impact on reducing the rate of assaults. In addition, those who attended safety training courses did not report a reduced rate of physical assaults.\nThese findings highlight the need for both organisational and personal changes in practice in order to reduce the assault rate. Organisational changes include the provision of appropriate safety equipment, safety training for consultants, enhancing multidisciplinary teams and utilising risk assessment. Consultants' personal practices to improve their safety may offer useful information for inclusion in safety training courses.

This measures a wide range of needs over 24 areas, from personal care, to social, financial and psychological care needs. Qualitative information was also obtained from carers regarding services available and their accessibility. A measure of carer stress and satisfaction with help for this was also obtained.\nOverall, the highest levels of need identified (both met and unmet) were in the areas of psychological functioning (memory and psychological distress), followed by social needs in the areas of managing money, daytime activities, self-care, and looking after the home. Highest unmet social needs were in the areas of daytime activities, home care and managing money. For 23/24 domains, carers were satisfied rather then unsatisfied with help received.

Psychiatric illness leading to suicide is a significant factor in at least 10% of maternal deaths. Despite Royal College of Psychiatry and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommendations for specialist provision of perinatal mental health services, this remains sporadic and insufficient. We set out to develop a new integrated antenatal-psychiatric direct referral pathway and present a year of experience using this service model. The psychiatric service was delivered from within the antenatal clinic setting with a direct health-care professional (HCP) led referral pathway between 2003 and 2004. The service comprised one session per week of a senior psychiatric specialist registrar and provided three new patients and two follow-up appointments per week. During this period, a total of 75 referrals to the service were made with 57 individuals attending for an appointment. There was a range of diagnoses among the women who attended, with only 24% meeting eligibility criteria for referral to secondary psychiatric services. The majority diagnosis was depression. More severely ill women were not referred to this clinic by obstetric HCPs. In conclusion, this model for developing and delivering a specialist perinatal psychiatric service using direct links to antenatal medical care was not successful despite requiring minimal funding. Nevertheless, it has been used to inform development of a new perinatal service in keeping with the Royal College of Psychiatrists' recommendations and incorporating enhanced training of HCPs responsible for the referral pathway."}, {"Title": "A study of contingent negative variation and post-imperative negative variation: search for state and trait electrophysiological markers in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "To compare event-related potential measures, contingent negative variation and post-imperative negative variation in drug-na\u00efve or drug-free schizophrenic patients and normal healthy controls, and to study the effect of antipsychotic medication on the above measures.\nA hospital-based prospective study was conducted at Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi, India. The sample constituted 31 drug-na\u00efve or drug-free patients with schizophrenia and 31 normal healthy individuals, matched for age and gender. An S1-S2 paradigm was used, in which the warning stimulus (S1) was auditory and the target stimulus or imperative stimulus (S2) was visual. The early contingent negative variation was marked at 500 milliseconds after S1, and late contingent negative variation was marked as the negative wave just prior to S2. The post-imperative negative variation was measured as the continued negativity after S2.\nDrug-na\u00efve and drug-free patients significantly differed from the controls on amplitudes of early and late contingent negative variations, as well as on latency of late contingent negative variation. The rate for correct classification in 80% of cases (Wilks' lambda = 0.76) was observed in measuring amplitude of late contingent negative variation only. After exposure to antipsychotic drugs, the late contingent negative variation amplitude was found to normalise in the patient group.\nThe late contingent negative variation could be considered a state marker for schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "The evolution of Harry Harlow: from the nature to the nurture of love.", "Abstract": "Harlow deserves a place in the early history of evolutionary psychiatry but not, as he is commonly presented, because of his belief in the instinctual nature of the mother-infant dyad.

This article will elucidate how the reputed authors composed this paper to make it a strong argument for biological psychiatry. Through a close reading of their correspondence, it will furthermore clarify the elements which remained unspoken in the paper, but which were elementary in its genesis. The first was the dominance of psychoanalytical theory in (American) psychiatry--a dominance which the authors wanted to break. The second was the ongoing discussion on the boundaries of biological determinism and the desirability of a new kind of eugenics.

In the present paper, treatment effects at 6-month follow-up were studied. 94 children with ADHD, aged 8-12 years, completed either 36 sessions of NF training (n = 59) or a computerised AST (n = 35). Pre-training, post-training and follow-up assessment encompassed several behaviour rating scales (e.g., the German ADHD rating scale, FBB-HKS) completed by parents. Follow-up information was analysed in 61 children (ca. 65%) on a per-protocol basis. 17 children (of 33 dropouts) had started a medication after the end of the training or early in the follow-up period. Improvements in the NF group (n = 38) at follow-up were superior to those of the control group (n = 23) and comparable to the effects at the end of the training. For the FBB-HKS total score (primary outcome measure), a medium effect size of 0.71 was obtained at follow-up. A reduction of at least 25% in the primary outcome measure (responder criterion) was observed in 50% of the children in the NF group.

Psychiatrists who experienced training for 3 months or more rate themselves higher with regard to pharmacotherapy, and those who underwent training in private psychiatric hospitals rate themselves higher with regard to their understanding of psychiatric disorders. It was suggested that the introduction of primary psychiatric training has promoted motivation to become a psychiatrist and that the length of the training period and type of institution lead to differences in the acquisition of psychiatric skills. Psychiatrists who train residents thought that the skill that residents most needed to acquire was intervention for suicidal patients, but, for residents, this was the least useful item in their training. It was suggested that, in the current situation, there is an insufficient acquisition of learning items.

The total number of discharges increased significantly from the first to the second period. Although the average length of stay remained similar, the number of readmissions occurring within 30 days of discharge was much lower during the hospitalist period.

However, current methods do not produce a measure of the reliability of the predictions. Knowing the risk of the error associated with a given prediction is essential for the development of neuroimaging-based clinical tools. We propose a general probabilistic classification method to produce measures of confidence for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We describe the application of transductive conformal predictor (TCP) to MRI images. TCP generates the most likely prediction and a valid measure of confidence, as well as the set of all possible predictions for a given confidence level. We present the theoretical motivation for TCP, and we have applied TCP to structural and functional MRI data in patients and healthy controls to investigate diagnostic and prognostic prediction in depression. We verify that TCP predictions are as accurate as those obtained with more standard machine learning methods, such as support vector machine, while providing the additional benefit of a valid measure of confidence for each prediction."}, {"Title": "Freud's excellent adventure Down Under: the only publication in Australia by the founder of psychoanalysis.", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to describe the circumstances surrounding the only paper published in Australia by Sigmund Freud--his only publication in the Southern Hemisphere--in 1911.\nThe invitations in 1911 from a Sydney psychoanalysis study group to Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and Havelock Ellis to present papers at the Australasian Medical Congress, came at a time when the world was barely aware of Freud's new psychology, and well in advance of many other countries. Sparring by Freud and Jung over a joint presentation was evident in the respective papers they sent, and they soon parted. A review of other papers presented at the congress indicates that Australian psychiatry, notwithstanding its slow progress, was well informed on recent developments, which was to manifest with biological treatments, as well as with the establishment of psychoanalysis. Despite its distance from Vienna, Australia seemed to have a special place in Freud's mind that was to surface in various ways over the years, not least in Totem and Taboo."}, {"Title": "Mental health care on the streets: An integrated approach.", "Abstract": "Mental illness can be both a cause of and a reaction to being homeless. When homelessness co-exists with mental illness, the provision of care for very vulnerable people is significantly complicated. Our initiative built on a model of assertive outreach and embedded mental health staff into the daily operations of Hanover Welfare Services and Sacred Heart Mission welfare services in inner Melbourne. The initiative's aim was to facilitate closer collaboration between mental health and welfare services and develop staff capacity to better identify and support people living homeless with a mental illness.\nThe project involved studying the impact of our assertive outreach model on consumer and service outcomes. Demographic, clinical and service usage details for consumers engaged by the initiative were recorded. Changes to the rate of admission of people from both welfare services to The Alfred Inpatient Psychiatry Unit and requests for support from The Alfred Crisis Assessment and Treatment Service were also recorded.\nPeople engaged by this initiative had high levels of previous emergency medical or psychiatric service usage, but relatively low levels of current community mental health engagement. There were also high levels (almost 52%) of comorbid substance misuse. The initiative was, however, able to engage more people in ongoing community mental health care, which particularly when provided in collaboration between mental health and welfare staff, achieved improvements in accommodation stability. The initiative also resulted in improved identification and prevention of mental illness crises through supporting a more rapid onsite mental health response.\nEmbedding mental health staff into the daily operations of two welfare services in inner Melbourne improved inter-service collaboration and the identification and care for people living homeless with a mental illness."}, {"Title": "Microembolic signals in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.", "Abstract": "Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is a common and less understood aspect of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Microembolic signals (MES) have been reported in SLE. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the frequency of MES among patients with CNS involvement and those without. The main aim of the study is to clarify the pathophysiology of the CNS involvement in SLE.\nSixty eight patients with a diagnosis of SLE (60 females, 8 males) participated in the study. Both middle cerebral arteries were monitored using transcranial Doppler for 60 min to detect MES. All cases underwent neurology and psychiatry assessments.\nMES were detected in 7/68 patients (10.3%) with the mean number of 3.5 per hour. MES were significantly higher in patients with CNS involvement (6/24, 25%) than those without (1/44, 2.2%) (P=0.006). SLE disease activity index, duration of disease, plaque formation, intima-media thickness, and antiphospholipid antibodies were not associated with MES.

This has given rise to numerous contributions, mostly in the form of Psychopharmacology publications. The aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluate these contributions and compare them with other academic disciplines related to Psychopharmacology. Using the PubMed database, we retrieved information about articles from 15 journals included in the Pharmacology and Pharmacy category of the Journal Citation Reports database for a 21-year period (1987 to 2007). There were 37540 articles which about 52% were represented by 3 journals. About 70% of psychology publications were represented by 2 of these journals. Psychology departments accounted for the 11% of the published papers, which places Psychology third behind Psychiatry and Pharmacology, which contributed to 22.69 and 13% respectively. Psychology contributed to the greatest number of studies in 3 journals, second in 3 and third in 8.

However, inconsistencies in outcome between studies suggest a need to review the available evidence systematically. As a result, major bibliographic databases were searched for studies examining the relationship between pre-morbid personality and challenging behaviour in order to conduct a systematic review. We included all English language studies published in referenced journals that assessed pre-morbid personality via a valid comprehensive personality measure, and also explored a relationship with challenging behaviour in people with dementia. A total of 18 studies were identified that covered a wide range of challenging behaviours including 'wandering', affective states, aggression, anxiety and delusions/hallucinations. Studies were assessed for their methodological quality and statistical findings. Studies lacked representative samples, were affected by confounding variables and suffered from small sample sizes. However, 72% of the studies reported significant relationships between pre-morbid personality and behaviour. In terms of specific relationships, the strongest evidence was found for a positive relationship between pre-morbid neuroticism and mood, and aggression and overall behavioural acts, thus supporting the inclusion of personality as one factor in the formulation of behaviour (Ballard, C., O'Brien, J., James, I., & Swann, A.

EMD can also be incorporated into the use of hypnosis, although the two are not the same thing. This study examined various clinical applications of the eye movement component of EMD (known as alternating bilateral stimulation (ABS)) on fearful dental patients who had a history of traumatic dental experiences. Findings were based on the clinical impressions and assessments of both the patients and the operating team. Results show that ABS, while effective for enabling patients to undergo non-invasive dental procedures such as clinical examinations and simple prophylaxis, has only limited beneficial effect for extremely fearful patients who must undergo invasive procedures such as extraction, drilling, and injections. Nevertheless, ABS is effective for mild to moderate patient phobia and anxiety. Although EMD is more effective than ABS, ABS is simple and easy for patients and clinicians to perform during treatment and can be performed readily in the dental office."}, {"Title": "Partnerships between pediatric palliative care and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Children with life-threatening illnesses and their families may face physical, emotional, psychosocial, and spiritual challenges throughout the children's course of illness.

Despite the fact that Canada has more than 4000 psychiatrists officially recognized by RCPSC, and a national body of more than 200 members who practice primarily in geriatric psychiatry, the status of geriatric psychiatry as a subspecialty of psychiatry in Canada remained \"unofficial\" until 2009.\nEarly along the pathway toward subspecialization, Canadian educational efforts focused on enhancing the capacity of primary care physicians and other mental health professionals to meet the mental health needs of older adults. Over the past decade, and with the encouragement of RCPSC, Canadian psychiatric educators have carefully and collaboratively defined the competencies necessary for general psychiatrists to practice across the life span, thereby influencing the psychiatry training programs to include dedicated time in geriatric psychiatry, and a more consistently defined training experience.\nWith these two important building blocks in place, Canadian psychiatry was truly ready to move ahead with subspecialization. Three new psychiatric subspecialties - geriatric, child and adolescent, and forensic - were approved at the RCPSC in September 2009.\nThe developments of the past 20 years have paved the way for a subspecialty geriatric psychiatry curriculum that will be well-aligned with a new general psychiatry curriculum, and ready to complement the existing mental health work force with subspecialized skills aimed at caring for the most complex elderly patients."}, {"Title": "PCM1 and schizophrenia: a replication study in the Northern Swedish population.", "Abstract": "Previous studies implicated centrosomal dysfunction as a source of various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (SZ).

In this study, we aimed to replicate these findings in a Northern Swedish association sample of 486 research subjects with SZ and 512 unrelated control individuals. We genotyped 12 previously described SNP markers and carried out haplotype analyses using the same multi-marker haplotypes previously reported. Though we could not replicate the association with SNPs rs445422 and rs208747, we did observe a significant protective association with intronic SNP rs13276297. Furthermore, we performed a meta-analysis comprising 1,794 SZ patients and 1,553 controls, which confirmed the previously reported association with rs445422 and rs208747.

CFG provides a fit-to-disease prioritization of genes that leads to generalizability in independent cohorts, and counterbalances the fit-to-cohort prioritization inherent in classic genetic-only approaches, which have been plagued by poor reproducibility across cohorts. We have now extended our previous work to include more datasets of GWAS, and more recent evidence from other lines of work. In essence our analysis is the most comprehensive integration of genetics and functional genomics to date in the field of bipolar disorder. Biological pathway analyses identified top canonical pathways, and epistatic interaction testing inside these pathways has identified genes that merit future follow-up as direct interactors (intra-pathway epistasis, INPEP). Moreover, we have put together a panel of best P-value single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), based on the top candidate genes we identified. We have developed a genetic risk prediction score (GRPS) based on our panel, and demonstrate how in two independent test cohorts the GRPS differentiates between subjects with bipolar disorder and normal controls, in both European-American and African-American populations.

The review of the literature has raised many doubts on the mirror neuron system paradigm as proposed by Gallese et al. and Rizzolatti et al. The experimental protocols of the seminal works appear, in our opinion, inadequate for various reasons. From the examination of the literature one can only hypothesize that, in a subject having previous experience of what it is observing, a more or less widespread network of neurons activates in a manner seemingly similar to mirroring in an effort to trying to interpret an action or what happened, or to program or to help to perform an action."}, {"Title": "Effectiveness of formal observation in inpatient psychiatry in preventing adverse outcomes: the state of the science.", "Abstract": "Formal observation in psychiatric settings is a widely accepted intervention employed by psychiatric nurses to reduce the incidence of adverse patient outcomes such as suicides, self-harm, violence and elopements in the psychiatric population. Formal observation includes general or routine observation, observation every 15 or 30 min, continuous or constant observation, and one-to-one observation. While formal observation consumes nursing resources, the efficacy of formal observation in reducing patient risk and providing therapeutic benefit remains unclear. To date, no randomized controlled studies exist. The existing qualitative research fails to demonstrate a direct correlation between the act of formal observation and the prevention of adverse patient outcomes. Common in the literature is a debate as to whether formal observation or therapeutic engagement is more beneficial.

It is suggested that neurobiological substrates such as adiponectin, dopamine (D2 receptors), endocannabinoids, ghrelin, leptin, nesfatin-1, norepinephrine, orexin, oxytocin, serotonin, vasopressin, CCK, GLP-1, MCH, PYY, and stress hormones (e.g., CRF) in the brain (e.g., OFC, VTA, NAcc, and the hypothalamus) may determine parameters in the economic theory of obesity. Also, the importance of introducing time-inconsistent and gain/loss-asymmetrical temporal discounting (intertemporal choice) models based on Tsallis' statistics and incorporating time-perception parameters into the neuroeconomic theory is emphasized.

Problems with GAF show a need for its further development (for example validity and reliability problems). The aim of the present study was to identify gaps in current knowledge about properties of GAF that are of interest for further development. Properties of GAF are defined as characteristic traits or attributes that serve to define GAF (or may have a role to define a future updated GAF).\nA thorough literature search was conducted.\nA number of gaps in knowledge about the properties of GAF were identified: for example, the current GAF has a continuous scale, but is a continuous or categorical scale better? Scoring is not performed by setting a mark directly on a visual scale, but could this improve scoring? Would new anchor points, including key words and examples, improve GAF (anchor points for symptoms, functioning, positive mental health, prognosis, improvement of generic properties, exclusion criteria for scoring in 10-point intervals, and anchor points at the endpoints of the scale)? Is a change in the number of anchor points and their distribution over the total scale important? Could better instructions for scoring within 10-point intervals improve scoring? Internationally, both single and dual scales for GAF are used, but what is the advantage of having separate symptom and functioning scales? Symptom (GAF-S) and functioning (GAF-F) scales should score different dimensions and still be correlated, but what is the best combination of definitions for GAF-S and GAF-F? For GAF with more than two scales there is limited empirical testing, but what is gained or lost by using more than two scales?\nIn the history of GAF, its basic properties have undergone limited changes. Problems with GAF may, in part, be due to lack of a research programme testing the effects of different changes in basic properties. Given the widespread use, research-based development of GAF has not been especially strong.

In total, 98 articles covering almost 15,000 suicides were reviewed and analyzed. Rates and demographic features connected to suicides varied substantially between articles, suggesting distinct subgroups of patients committing suicide (e.g., depressed vs. schizophrenic patients) with their own suicide determinants and patterns. Early in the admission is clearly a high-risk period for suicide, but risk declines more slowly for patients with schizophrenia. Suicide rates were found to be associated with admission numbers, and as expected, previous suicidal behavior was found to be a robust predictor of future suicide. The methods used for suicide are linked to availability of means. Timing and location of suicides seem to be associated with absence of support, supervision, and the presence of family conflict. Although there is a strong notion that suicides cluster in time, clear statistical evidence for this is lacking. For prevention of suicides, staff need to engage with patients' family problems, and reduce absconding without locking the door. Future research should take into account the heterogeneous subgroups of patients who commit suicide, with case-control studies addressing these separately."}, {"Title": "[Image of their careers and of the future of Hungarian psychiatrists].", "Abstract": "Former studies call the attention to the somatic and mental dangers of the medical profession.

In response, The Netherlands organization for health research and development (ZonMw) initiated a euro 24 million stimulation programme over a 10-year period, which started in 2003. Long-term follow-up studies were initiated for anxiety and depressive disorders (NESDA), psychotic disorders (GROUP) and child psychiatric disorders (TRAILS, Generation R). In addition, 41 practice-oriented projects and 35 PhD projects were funded. The programme has resulted in four unique databases, a multitude of additional grants and a large number of international publications and PhD theses. Perhaps more importantly, many clinical practitioners had the opportunity to participate in research projects and to develop a more critical and evidence-based attitude. The programme demonstrates that financial stimulation can effectively improve the practitioner's evidence-based attitude."}, {"Title": "Outcome, recovery and return to work in severe mental illnesses.", "Abstract": "The assessment of outcomes of severe mental illnesses has become recently an important line of research in psychiatry, leading to distinguish different levels of outcomes and a diversity of underlying factors. The focus has shifted from a traditional medical notion of 'disease outcome' to a wider notion of 'functional outcome', and even to an inquiry about the fate of the person and its determinants. Recovery, rather than cure or remission, is regarded as the good outcome, with its own underlying factors. Return to work, as a vocational outcome, represents in research one of the good functional outcomes. It is generally understood as a sign of social recovery. But may work be regarded as a good outcome in its broader sense, i.e. as a means of full recovery? Several theoretical and empirical arguments are in favor of considering work as a privileged way toward recovery, but this does not mean it is the only way."}, {"Title": "[The need of qualitative research in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The authors present basic information about qualitative research along with its theoretical frame as a useful approach in the study of many issues in the area of psychiatry and psychotherapy. According to the authors, the quantitative methodology--dominant in psychiatry nowadays--seems insufficient to address all issues to be studied in this area. After a short introduction of the theoretical background of qualitative research, the authors present methods of collecting and analysing qualitative data and possible ways of using them in practice. In psychiatry, there are many complex psychotherapeutic methods used, their effects depending on many conditions, such as feelings and actions of patients and therapists. Hence, qualitative methods--which enable researchers to study the complexity of human interactions--seem to be well suited for psychiatric research. However, the authors conclude, the reason for choosing one or the other method should be practical rather than ideological; the methods indeed very often complete, rather than exclude each other, in research practice."}, {"Title": "A care planning strategy for traumatic life events in community mental health and inpatient psychiatry based on the InterRAI assessment instruments.", "Abstract": "Clinical triggers from the Traumatic Life Events Clinical Assessment Protocol (CAP) identify individuals who might benefit from formal services or additional supports targeted towards trauma treatment.

It is here proposed that application of social psychiatric thinking and workers' compensation experience can help in understanding the problem. Social psychiatry has been neglected in the training of so many psychiatrists that many of them fail to understand the Army as a community and to recognize that a community's parts may develop symptom neuroses. Most psychiatrists, however, do know that a symptom neurosis will not disappear until it no longer serves its purposes. The young soldier may know that he is being trained for combat duty but manages to distance himself from the terrible realities of military combat by creating a psychic reality that protects him. Social psychiatric emphasis is used to describe his response when brought face to face with himself as a combatant with overwhelming responsibilities and genuine lethal danger. The brilliance and relevance of social thinking is demonstrated by examples from the works of Gustave LeBon and Georg Simmel so that its application to present--and future--military problems may be brought into focus."}, {"Title": "Impact on suicidality of the borderline personality traits impulsivity and affective instability.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to test the impact on suicidality (suicide threats, attempts) of the borderline personality disorder (BPD) traits impulsivity and affective instability in mood disorders.\nIn a general psychiatry private practice (nontertiary care), consecutive remitted, non-substance-abusing outpatients--138 with bipolar II disorder (BP II) and 71 with major depressive disorder (MDD)--self-assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) Questionnaire.\nThe frequency (higher in BP II) of suicidality was 14%; impulsivity, 37%; and affective instability, 58%.

This statement is an independent report of the panel and is not a policy statement of the NIH or the Federal Government.\nCognitive decline and Alzheimer\u2019s disease are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide and are substantially burdensome to the affected persons, their caregivers, and society in general. Extensive research over the past 20 years has provided important insights on the nature of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cognitive decline and the magnitude of the problem. Nevertheless, there remain important and formidable challenges in conducting research on these diseases, particularly in the area of prevention. Currently, firm conclusions cannot be drawn about the association of any modifiable risk factor with cognitive decline or Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Highly reliable consensus-based diagnostic criteria for cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease are lacking, and available criteria have not been uniformly applied. Evidence is insufficient to support the use of pharmaceutical agents or dietary supplements to prevent cognitive decline or Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We recognize that a large amount of promising research is under way; these efforts need to be increased and added to by new understandings and innovations (as noted in our recommendations for future research). For example, ongoing studies including (but not limited to) studies on antihypertensive medications, omega-3 fatty acids, physical activity, and cognitive engagement may provide new insights into the prevention or delay of cognitive decline or Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This important research needs to be supplemented by further studies. Large-scale population-based studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are critically needed to investigate strategies to maintain cognitive function in individuals at risk for decline, to identify factors that may delay the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease among persons at risk, and to identify factors that may slow the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease among persons in whom the condition is already diagnosed."}, {"Title": "[Prevalence, diagnosis and treatment of personality disorders in older adults].", "Abstract": "This article addresses manifestation, course, diagnosis and treatment of personality disorders in older adults (>60 yrs).\nA literature search, using \"Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)\", Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR)\", \"PsychINFO 2000-present\" and \"PUBMED\", concerning relevant literature from 1980-2009. Keywords were \"personality disorder\", \"elderly\", \"older adults\", \"prevalence\", \"diagnosis\" and \"treatment\". The combinations of these keywords resulted in 32 relevant hits.\nPrevalence studies addressing specific personality disorders show that within different subpopulations personality pathology of clusters A and C (odd respectively anxious behaviour) are quite common in older adults whereas cluster B personality disorders (impulsive behaviour) is more prevalent in younger adults. Besides, it appears that the personality questionnaires and interviews used in adult care are not yet validated for older adults in mental health care and nursing homes. Furthermore, there is no convincing reason why psychotherapy variants proven to be effective for adults (<50 yrs) wouldn't be feasible for older adults. Particularly with respect to cognitive (behavioural) therapy and schema therapy, there is some evidence from case studies suggesting that these therapies are well applicable to the elderly.\nPrevalence rates appear questionable since the assessment methods applied in the epidemiological studies correspond inadequately to the specific behavioural manifestations of elderly persons with personality pathology. In addition, the number of specific (test)diagnostic tools for older adults are scarce. Currently, there is a lack of empirical data concerning treatment of personality disorders in older adults.

Suzanna was placed in foster care with her current adoptive family after her birth. Her initial evaluation at 4 years revealed a global developmental delay (physical: 6 months; social and communication: 12 months). Improvements in development seemed to be in response to subsequent interventions. At 5 years, she had borderline intellectual functioning, an expressive or receptive language disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Suzanna experienced an abrupt developmental decline at 6 1/2 years old. She lost cognitive abilities, and she no longer carried on conversations. Although she was no longer interactive with most people, she remained affectionate with her parents. Her mother thought that Suzanna had visual and auditory hallucinations. In addition, she developed encopresis and hand flapping. A neurological evaluation, including a test for Rett Syndrome, was negative. Her Full Scale IQ dropped from 73 to 50 with decreased adaptive functioning and clinically significant problems with hyperactivity, attention, and functional communication. Suzanna's development stabilized temporarily during an 18-month period. A second period of declining function included \"zombie-like\" behavior, anxiety, and hallucinations. Weekly sessions in child psychiatry included treatment with risperidone, methylphenidate, and supportive therapy for mother and child.

Four weeks prior to admission, she had a viral upper respiratory infection (URI) with cough which was treated with over-the-counter cough syrup. After resolution of the URI, she developed a persistent cough that turned into a \"bark\"-like vocalization. Both the mother and patient demonstrated the bark as an \"arf\" sound like that of a small dog at times, a large dog at others. These vocalizations were unrelenting, occurring 3-10 times per minute only while awake. They were not precipitated by any known factors nor were there alleviating factors. She could not voluntarily suppress the sound. In addition to the vocalizations, episodes of generalized shaking of the extremities began 2 weeks prior to admission. According to Erica's mother, each episode lasted about 10-60 seconds and occurred 30-40 times a day only when she was awake. These episodes were not rhythmic or symmetric, and they were not associated with bowel or bladder incontinence. There was no alteration of consciousness following the episodes. Erica denied any recollection of the barking or shaking. The medical evaluation did not reveal an etiology. It included a complete physical examination, a neurological examination, biochemical laboratory studies, and a negative video EEG study that captured 10 episodes of shaking. Child psychiatry was consulted. Erica was a pleasant, quiet female with slightly constricted affect and a normal speech pattern. She reported that she was a straight-A honors student who had difficulty trusting others; she said that she had no friends, only \"associates.\" She said that she had periods of feeling \"sad\" and crying easily, but could not identify any recent stressful event.

The search was limited to articles written in English and published between 1966 and 2009. In addition, we manually searched each citation for additional references and the following journals: Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology.\nAll articles were manually reviewed and evaluated. Thereafter, each agent or class of medication was categorized by level of evidence.\nThree double-blind, randomized controlled trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 1 double-blind randomized controlled trial of imipramine in children and adolescents with PTSD or acute stress disorder were identified. Additionally, several open-label studies and case series involving other classes of medications (eg, antiadrenergics, other antidepressants, and second-generation antipsychotics) were reviewed.\nThe extant data do not support the use of SSRIs as first-line treatments for PTSD in children and adolescents.

Patients often access mental healthcare services due to behavior problems, such as aggressiveness and impulsiveness, and are frequently intellectually disabled. We report a case of a patient with 48,XXYY syndrome treated in a general adult psychiatry department.A 23-year-old man was frequently admitted to our inpatient psychiatric unit (14 admissions in five years) due to disruptive behavior, including self harm, aggression to objects and animals, and fire-setting behavior, in a context of dysphoric mood and marked impulsivity. Upon observation, the patient had mild intellectual disability, with prominent impulsive and aggressive features and very low tolerance to frustration. His physical examination revealed hypertelorism, increased thickness of neck, acne, sparse body hair, triangular pubic hair distribution, fifth digit clinodactyly, small testicles and penis, and gynecoid pelvis. Laboratory analysis revealed endocrine abnormalities (low plasma testosterone and subclinical hypothyroidism). Cardiac Doppler sonogram was normal. Electroencephalogram revealed only a diffuse slowing electrogenesis, with no etiological specificity. Clinical suspicion of a chromosomal disorder was confirmed by a 48,XXYY karyotype. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging detected discrete bilateral reduction of the hippocampal formations, possibly related to temporal dysgenesia. Psychopharmacological treatment options met moderate success, with lack of adherence. Other psychosocial treatment interventions ensued, including family therapy and psychoeducation.

There were strong significant (canonical R>0,8; p=0,02) positive correlations between the therapeutic effectiveness of neuroleptics (haloperidol and clozapine) and values of factors of inherent immunity in the group of 34 men with schizophrenia, aged from 16 to 34 years, with the first episode of psychosis. The effectiveness of treatment was assessed by the percentage reduction of total scores on the PANSS scale or scores on PANSS subscales (positive, negative and general psychopathology) at the beginning and the end (after 60 days) of the treatment. Initial parameters of factors of inherent immunity (levels of gamma-interferon production by T-lymphocytes, proportion of phagocytosing neutrophils and monocytes, and cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes - natural killers) contributed to 67,3%, or more than two thirds, of the variance of treatment effects. The contribution of inherent immunity factors was determined mainly by their similar effects on the reduction of positive and general psychopathological symptoms, with the minimal effect on the reduction of negative symptoms. The maximum correlation was found for weighting coefficients for inherent immunity factors estimated as 0,567 for the proportion of phagocytosing neutrophils and monocytes; 0,518 - for the levels of gamma-interferon production by T-lymphocytes and 0,334 - for cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes - natural killers. The authors suggest that the reduction of activity of the cell branch of inherent immunity develops before the disease manifestation. It creates conditions for the activation of latently persistent infections (the cytomegalovirus infection, in our case) in a patient's organism, with the formation of therapeutic resistance. The method described may be widely used in clinical and biological psychiatry and neurology."}, {"Title": "[Information for patients about hospital infections in psychiatry: An assessment of healthcare professionals' knowledge, opinion and attitude].", "Abstract": "French legislation makes mandatory for healthcare providers the disclosure of hospital infection (HI) risk and actual occurrence to the patient. Given the specific diseases encountered in psychiatry, some difficulties may be expected in practical application of this regulation.\nThe aim of our study was to describe the knowledge, declared practices and opinions of healthcare workers (HCW) in psychiatry concerning information for patients about HI.\nWe randomly selected doctors, nurses and head nurses from four hospitals with psychiatric activity in Normandy. The HCW were asked to self-complete an anonymous questionnaire, including data describing the responding HCW and questions aiming at describing his/her knowledge, attitude in routine daily practice and opinion about information to patients about HI.\nOne hundred and forty-one HCW were initially selected, of which 114 (80.9%) eventually agreed to complete the questionnaire. Only eight HCW (7.0%) were considered to have a correct overall knowledge of legal obligations. Main errors concerned the obligation to inform the patient of the HI risk according to the medical procedures that are to be performed (43.9% of correct answers) and the obligation to inform the patient of the HI risk according to his/her medical condition (46.5%). The obligation to inform the patient of the occurrence of a HI was largely known (84.2%). HCW usually giving information about the risk of HI to patients without HI accounted for 5.3%. Main reasons advocated for not informing patients were a low level risk of HI in psychiatry (80.4%) and the lack of patients' demand (59.8%). In the case of HI occurrence, the percentage of HCW routinely informing patients was 13.2%. HCW systematically informing the patient's family about the occurrence of HI accounted for 9.6%. A large proportion of HCW supported delivering information to patients about HI (86.0%). HCW expected from information better approval of prevention programs by the patients (87.7%) but feared an increased anxiety in patients (75.4%) and a higher rate of care refusal (48.2%).\nWhereas a very large proportion of HCW in psychiatry support delivering information to patients about HI, our study shows HCW's lack of awareness of regulations and lack of declared practices. Among factors explaining this contrast, a lower perceived HI risk and severity level are to be mentioned. Training programs focusing on risk and mechanisms of HI could be offered to professionals in psychiatry. The issue of specific communication difficulties with psychiatric patients should be addressed as well. In order to develop information on HI, specific methods suited to those patients should be developed."}, {"Title": "[Rethink the panic disorder].", "Abstract": "We propose some reflexions on the validity of the conceptualization of panic disorder, its nosographical place, and its clinical homogeneity, through the study of the frequency of some of its psychiatric comorbidities.\nTo define a panic attack, DSM IV requires a number of symptoms which vary from four to 13. However, some patients suffer from panic attacks with less than four symptoms (paucisymptomatic attacks) and which fill the other criteria of panic disorder. These patients would have a biological vulnerability, familial antecedents, and a treatment response which are similar to those that fill the criteria of the panic attack according to the DSM. Some authors differentiate the panic disorder in several sub-groups, such as the panic disorder with cardiorespiratory symptoms, or vestibular symptoms, or cognitive symptoms. This division of the panic disorder in several sub-groups would have an interest in the knowledge of the etiopathogeny, the attacks' frequency, the disorder severity and the treatment response. Panic disorder with prevalent somatic expression includes crises without cognitive symptoms. This sub-type can be common in the medical context, especially in cardiology, but it is often ignored, at the price of loss of socio-professional adaptability, and a medical overconsumption.\nThe relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobia appears to be the subject of controversies. According to the behavioral theory, phobic disorder is the primum movens of the sequence of appearance of the disorders. American psychiatry considers agoraphobia as a secondary response to the panic disorder, and pleads for a central role of panic attacks as an etiopathogenic factor in the development of agoraphobia. The distinction between panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder can be difficult. This is due to the existence of paucisymptomatic panic attacks. Their paroxystic nature is difficult to distinguish from the fluctuations of the generalized anxiety disorder. This frequent comorbidity could be also due to the community of certain symptoms of each disorder. These observations increase the validity of the anxiety generalized disorder as an autonomous morbid entity, rather than corresponding to a residual syndrome of the panic disorder, and could be an argument of an implicit return to the Freudian concept of the anxiety neurosis. The frequent comorbidity of panic disorder and personality disorders suggests the existence of a link. The pathological personality can be a factor of vulnerability in the panic disorder, as it can be a consequence of the panic disorder through the personality changing related on the evolution of the disorder and its complications. The relationship between panic disorder and depression has been interpreted in various ways, with mainly three assumptions: the unit position, which considers anxiety and depression as concerning a common diathesis; the dualistic position, which suggests that anxiety and depression are heterogeneous diagnostic categories and the anxio-depressive position that considers anxiety and depression combined as a syndrome differing from the pure anxiety and pure depression. The genetic studies, as well as the family studies, clearly show that the two entities are undissociated. Likewise, the therapeutic action of serotoninergic antidepressants in the two types of disorders reinforces the idea of a common biological vulnerability between anxiety and depression. Several studies have shown a significant association between panic disorder and suicide. However, the suicidal conducts are multiple and proceed by complex interactions between factors of features and states. Accordingly, panic disorder can be considered as a factor of state associated with the suicidal risk."}, {"Title": "Quality of life in post-traumatic orthopedically handicapped patients.", "Abstract": "The study was planned to assess quality of life (QOL) and factors affecting it in post-traumatic orthopedically handicapped patients.\nThis is hospital-based cross-sectional study which involves 68 patients with traumatic orthopedic handicapped injury in the Department of Orthopaedeics, Rehabilitation center and Psychiatry, Government Medical College, Patiala between May 07 and Aug 08.

Seventy-eight percent of medical students considered psychiatry as a potential career, and 28% indicated a strong interest in psychiatry. Sixty-four percent of general psychiatry residents considered child psychiatry as a career. Reasons precluding child psychiatry were preference for working with adults (33%), the clinical child rotation (19%), years of training (13%), and indebtedness (3%).\nMore effort is needed to address the barriers to selecting child psychiatry as a career among medical students and general psychiatry residents."}, {"Title": "Child psychiatry: what are we teaching medical students?", "Abstract": "The author describes child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) undergraduate teaching in American and Canadian medical schools.\nA survey asking for information on CAP teaching, student interest in CAP, and opinions about the CAP importance was sent to the medical student psychiatry director at 142 accredited medical schools in the United States and Canada. The results were summarized and various factors considered relevant to CAP student interest were analyzed statistically.\nApproximately 81% of the schools returned surveys. Most teach required CAP didactics in the preclinical and clinical years. Almost 63% of the schools have CAP clinical rotations; most are not required. Twenty-three percent of all medical students have a clinical CAP experience during their psychiatry clerkship. The majority of schools have CAP electives, and approximately 4.8% of students participate. Child and adolescent psychiatry leadership, early exposure to CAP, and CAP clinical experiences were related to student CAP interest, but these relationships were not statistically significant.\nThe time allotted to teaching CAP in the undergraduate medical curriculum is minimal, consistent with previous survey results. Most schools require didactic instruction averaging about 12 hours and offer elective clinical opportunities. The survey findings should help direct future planning to improve CAP medical student education."}, {"Title": "What is the role of consultation-liaison psychiatry in the management of depression in primary care? A systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "To assess the effectiveness of consultation-liaison services, involving mental health professionals working to advise and support primary care professionals in the management of depression.\nStudies of consultation-liaison for depression in primary care were identified from a systematic search of electronic databases, augmented by identification of papers from reference lists, published reviews and from hand searching. Data on study quality, intervention characteristics and outcomes were extracted by two reviewers, and outcome data were meta-analyzed.\nFive studies met the criteria. There was no significant effect of consultation-liaison on antidepressant use (risk ratio 1.23, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.66) or depression outcomes in the short- (standardized mean difference -0.04, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.14) or long-term (standardized mean difference 0.06, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.26).\nEvidence concerning consultation-liaison for depression in primary care remains limited, but the existing studies do not suggest it is more effective than usual care. Further research is required to explore the mechanisms by which consultation-liaison might be made more effective, including the potential role of consultation-liaison in combination with other models of care, and in other patient populations."}, {"Title": "Positive life events and mood disorders: longitudinal evidence for an erratic lifecourse hypothesis.", "Abstract": "An unresolved issue in psychiatry research concerns the assumption that detrimental effects of negative life events on mental health may be buffered by a multitude of positive life events. However, there is clear lack of empirical evidence for this assumption, and one may even argue that positive life events act as additional stressors and thus increase (and not decrease) the risk for affective disorders.\nData were used from 4796 adults aged 18-64, who participated in 2 waves (i.e., 1997 and 1999) of NEMESIS, a prospective-epidemiological study. Measures were based on diagnoses of DSM-III-R mood disorders, and a life events questionnaire employed in the NEMESIS study.\nAlthough the prevalence of mood disorders correlated positively with both the number of negative and positive life events experienced, a multivariate path analysis (Mplus) demonstrated that only negative life events longitudinally predicted mood disorders. Positive life events predicted subsequent mood disorders only when in the same time period a high number of negative events were experienced.\nPositive life events do not buffer the detrimental impact of negative ones, but instead may function as additional stressor, in the context of highly erratic life course patterns that may be typical for depressed individuals."}, {"Title": "Recognizing and managing anxiety disorders in primary health care in Turkey.", "Abstract": "Anxiety disorders are common and are frequently not diagnosed accurately in primary care.

(2007). Impact of in-home intervention versus telephone support in reducing depression and stress of Chinese caregivers: Results of a pilot study. American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, 15, 425-434.) found that an in-home behavioral management program, derived conceptually from cognitive behavioral theories (CBT), was effective in reducing caregiver related stress and depressive symptoms in Chinese American dementia caregivers (CGs). Results were promising, but a more cost-effective intervention is needed to serve this growing population. Past work also found that a psychoeducational videotaped training program based on CBT was effective in reducing stress due to caregiving in Caucasian and African American dementia family CGs (Steffen, 2000, Anger management for dementia caregivers: A preliminary study using video and telephone interventions. Behavior Therapy, 31, 281-299.). To date no research has been conducted using a technological medium to deliver a similar kind of intervention to Chinese American caregivers. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of a similar but culturally \"tailored\" program in which 70 CGs were randomly assigned to a 12-week CBT skill training program delivered on a DVD, or to a general educational DVD program on dementia. Both were available in Mandarin Chinese or English as preferred. Pre post change analyses indicated that CGs did not differ on change in level of negative depressive symptoms, but positive affect was higher, and patient behaviors were appraised as less stressful and bothersome, for CGs in the CBT skill training program. They were also more satisfied with the program overall and reported that they believed they were able to give care more effectively. Results encourage further development of theoretically based interventions, delivered using modern technology, for this ever increasing group of CGs."}, {"Title": "Criteria for psychosomatic research (DCPR) in the medical setting.", "Abstract": "The Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR) represent a diagnostic and conceptual framework that aims to translate psychosocial variables derived from psychosomatic research into operational tools whereby individual patients can be identified.

A considerable number of people seem to hold that the basis for this assessment is that free will is required for legal responsibility, and that mental disorders can compromise free will. In fact, because of the alleged relationship between the forensic assessment and free will, researchers in forensic psychiatry also consider the complicated metaphysical discussions on free will relevant to the assessment. At the same time, there is concern about the lack of advancement with respect to clarifying the nature of the forensic assessment. In this paper I argue that, even if free will is considered relevant, there may be no need for forensic researchers to engage into metaphysical discussions on free will in order to make significant progress. I will do so, drawing a parallel between the assessment of criminal responsibility on the one hand, and the medical practice of obtaining informed consent on the other. I argue that also with respect to informed consent, free will is considered relevant, or even crucial. This is the parallel. Yet, researchers on informed consent have not entered into metaphysical debates on free will. Meanwhile, research on informed consent has made significant progress. Based on the parallel with respect to free will, and the differences with respect to research, I conclude that researchers on forensic assessment may not have to engage into metaphysical discussions on free will in order to advance our understanding of this psychiatric practice."}, {"Title": "Quality education: a pilot quality improvement curriculum for psychiatry residents.", "Abstract": "A series of Institute of Medicine's reports have highlighted the need for greater quality improvement (QI) training in medical education; however, few formal QI curricula for medical trainees have been described in the literature.\nThe objective of this study was to develop a contextual QI curriculum involving a QI workshop and longitudinal QI projects (QIPs) for psychiatry trainees.\nWe examined psychiatry residents' attitudes on QI training following their exposure to a physician-manager curriculum using focus group methodology.

Besides the hope set on this new therapeutic approach of DBS, there are at the same time doubts concerning the ethical acceptability in the treatment of individuals suffering from mental disorders. Taking the therapeutic benefit of DBS into account, the manuscript analyses ethical aspects of DBS application in psychiatry. In particular, possible effects on the patient's personality and self-determination are scrutinized. It is shown that personality changes may either occur as unintended and potentially ethically troublesome side effects or may even be intended as legitimate therapy goals. The patient's self-determination may be both, endangered and supported by DBS. The ethical assessment of DBS considers therapeutic benefits, the method's minimal invasiveness and reversibility on the one hand, as well as surgery-related risks of DBS treatment, an insufficient data-base due to currently missing long-term studies and the possibility of as yet inestimable, potentially long-term effects on the patient's personality and self-determination on the other hand. The ethical balancing arrives at the conclusion that DBS may be considered as ultima ratio in the treatment of psychiatric disorders and should preferably be combined with psychosocial measures. Furthermore, a prospective scientific evaluation of the procedure should include a systematic investigation of personality changes."}, {"Title": "Comment on E.F. Torrey and R.H.

The data resulting from this investigation were collected during ethnographic research conducted in 1998 and 2001 from an urban context in north-western Greece. 'Depression' was analysed as a medicalized form of female suffering in a Greek context, and three aspects of therapeutic pluralism were examined. The criteria through which patients prioritise certain practitioners over others, the role exerted by relatives in treatment research and manners of reconciliation of contradictory and heteroclite types of therapy were all investigated. In encounters with male practitioners (psychiatrists, priests and mediums) and close relatives attempting to help find a remedy in order to avoid stigmatization of mental disorder, female patients appear to oscillate between gender and healing powers. The field of therapeutic itineraries interacts with gender power relations to produce various technologies of discipline and practices of resistance as female patients are subjected to the bipolar power of male healers and their male relatives. These gender dynamics are interfaced in the broader competition for therapeutic authority between institutional psychiatry, the Orthodox Church and other alternative healers."}, {"Title": "Validation of a professionals' satisfaction questionnaire with electronic medical records (PSQ-EMR) in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Electronic medical records (EMR) are currently being implemented in psychiatric hospitals throughout Europe.

Psychiatric expertise was redefined along a biomedical model via a standardised nosology. While they were an integral part of capturing professional authority, the revisions demystified psychiatric expertise, leaving psychiatrists vulnerable to infringements upon their autonomy by institutions adopting the DSM literally. This research explores the tensions surrounding standardisation in psychiatry. Drawing on in-depth interviews with psychiatrists, I explore the 'sociological ambivalence' psychiatrists feel towards the DSM, which arises from the tension between the desire for autonomy in practice and the professional goal of legitimacy within the system of mental health professions. To carve a space for autonomy for their practice, psychiatrists develop 'workarounds' that undermine the DSM in practice. These workarounds include employing alternative diagnostic typologies, fudging the numbers (or codes) on official paperwork and negotiating diagnoses with patients. In creating opportunities for patient input and resistance to fixed diagnoses, the varied use of the DSM raises fundamental questions for psychiatrists about the role of the biomedical model of mental illness, especially its particular manifestation in the DSM."}, {"Title": "Atheism and mental health.", "Abstract": "The exploration of the impact of religiosity on mental health is an enduring, if somewhat quiet, tradition.

I argue that atheism (just like theism) is an appropriate domain of study for social and cultural psychiatrists (and allied social scientists) interested in exploring socio-environmental stressors and buffers relating to mental health. Specifically, I argue that (1) atheism needs to be accurately measured as an individual-level exposure variable, with the aim of relating that variable to psychiatric outcomes, (2) there needs to be greater systematic investigation into the influence of atheism on psychiatry as an institution, and (3) the relation of atheism to mental health needs to be explored by examining atheistic theory and its practical application, especially as it relates to the human condition, suffering, and concepts of personhood."}, {"Title": "Bipolar depression: overview and commentary.", "Abstract": "Depressive phases are the most prevalent component of bipolar disorders, even with modern treatment. Bipolar depressive morbidity is often misdiagnosed and is limited in response to available treatments. These conditions are especially debilitating and are associated with psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse, functional disability, and increased mortality owing to early suicide and accidents, and later medical illnesses. There is growing awareness that bipolar depression is one of the greatest challenges in modern psychiatry. It is essential to differentiate various forms of depression, dysthymia, and dysphoric mixed states of bipolar disorders from the clinical features of more common, unipolar major depressive disorders. In bipolar depression, antidepressant responses often are unsatisfactory, and these agents probably are overused. Emerging treatments, including several anticonvulsant and modern antipsychotic drugs, as well as lithium-alone or in selected combinations-are partially effective for bipolar depression. Interest in recognizing bipolar depression and seeking more effective, specific, and safer treatments for it are growing."}, {"Title": "Testing for misspecification in generalized linear mixed models.", "Abstract": "Generalized linear mixed models have become a frequently used tool for the analysis of non-Gaussian longitudinal data. Estimation is often based on maximum likelihood theory, which assumes that the underlying probability model is correctly specified. Recent research shows that the results obtained from these models are not always robust against departures from the assumptions on which they are based. Therefore, diagnostic tools for the detection of model misspecifications are of the utmost importance. In this paper, we propose 2 diagnostic tests that are based on 2 equivalent representations of the model information matrix. We evaluate the power of both tests using theoretical considerations as well as via simulation. In the simulations, the performance of the new tools is evaluated in many settings of practical relevance, focusing on misspecification of the random-effects structure. In all the scenarios, the results were encouraging, however, the tests also exhibited inflated Type I error rates when the sample size was small or moderate. Importantly, a parametric bootstrap version of the tests seems to overcome this problem, although more research in this direction may be needed.

As such, there is a need for in vivo imaging tracers so that the relationship between CB1 and schizophrenia (SZ) can be further studied. In this paper, we present our first human studies in both healthy control patients and patients with schizophrenia using the novel PET tracer, [(11)C]OMAR (JHU75528), we have shown its utility as a tracer for imaging human CB1 receptors and to investigate normal aging and the differences in the cannabinoid system of healthy controls versus patients with schizophrenia. A total of ten healthy controls and nine patients with schizophrenia were included and studied with high specific activity [(11)C]OMAR. The CB1 binding (expressed as the distribution volume; V(T)) was highest in the globus pallidus and the cortex in both controls and patients with schizophrenia. Controls showed a correlation with the known distribution of CB1 and decline of [(11)C]OMAR binding with age, most significantly in the globus pallidus. Overall, we observed elevated mean binding in patients with schizophrenia across all regions studied, and this increase was statistically significant in the pons (p<0.05), by the Students t-test. When we ran a regression of the control subjects V(T) values with age and then compared the patient data to 95% prediction limits of the linear regression, three patients fell completely outside for the globus pallidus, and in all other regions there were at least 1-3 patients outside of the prediction intervals. There was no statistically significant correlations between PET measures and the individual Brief Psychiatry Rating Score (BPRS) subscores (r=0.49), but there was a significant correlation between V(T) and the ratio of the BPRS psychosis to withdrawal score in the frontal lobe (r=0.60), and middle and posterior cingulate regions (r=0.71 and r=0.79 respectively). In conclusion, we found that [(11)C] OMAR can image human CB1 receptors in normal aging and schizophrenia. In addition, our initial data in subjects with schizophrenia seem to suggest an association of elevated binding specific brain regions and symptoms of the disease."}, {"Title": "Roles for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) expression and signaling in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in mediating the behavioral consequences of chronic stress.", "Abstract": "Anxiety disorders are frequently long-lasting and debilitating for more than 40 million American adults. Although stressor exposure plays an important role in the etiology of some anxiety disorders, the mechanisms by which exposure to stressful stimuli alters central circuits that mediate anxiety-like emotional behavior are still unknown. Substantial evidence has implicated regions of the central extended amygdala, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central nucleus of the amygdala as critical structures mediating fear- and anxiety-like behavior in both humans and animals. These areas organize coordinated fear- and anxiety-like behavioral responses as well as peripheral stress responding to threats via direct and indirect projections to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and brainstem regions (Walker et al. Eur J Pharmacol 463:199-216, 2003, Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry 33(8):1291-1308, 2009; Ulrich-Lai and Herman Nat Rev Neurosci 10:397-409, 2009). In particular, the BNST has been argued to mediate these central and peripheral responses when the perceived threat is of long duration (Waddell et al. Behav Neurosci 120:324-336, 2006) and/or when the anxiety-like response is sustained (Walker and Davis Brain Struct Funct 213:29-42, 2008); hence, the BNST may mediate pathological anxiety-like states that result from exposure to chronic stress. Indeed, chronic stress paradigms result in enhanced BNST neuroplasticity that has been associated with pathological anxiety-like states (Vyas et al. Brain Res 965:290-294, 2003; Pego et al. Eur J Neurosci 27:1503-1516, 2008). Here we review evidence that suggests that pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) work together to modulate BNST function and increase anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, we have shown that BNST PACAP as well as its cognate PAC1 receptor is substantially upregulated following chronic stress, particularly in the BNST oval nucleus where PACAP-containing neurons closely interact with CRH-containing neurons (Kozicz et al. Brain Res 767:109-119, 1997; Hammack et al. Psychoneuroendocrinology 34:833-843, 2009).

Such genes are highly represented in the brain and placental transcriptomes, and have been shown to exert significant influence on fundamental developmental processes in these organs. Converging evidence from work in man and animal models has shown that imprinted genes can influence a variety of brain and behavioral endophenotypes. In this article, we review the current evidence that imprinted gene dysfunction is associated with vulnerability to several common psychiatric disorders. We also discuss how studying imprinted gene (dys)function may provide mechanistic insights into two important areas in modern psychiatry: first, how environmental factors (especially in utero) interact with genetic liability via epigenetic mechanisms to predispose to later mental illness, and second, the molecular underpinnings of sex-specific vulnerability to psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Bipolar disorder in children and adolescents in Germany: national trends in the rates of inpatients, 2000-2007.", "Abstract": "Increasing admission and prevalence rates of bipolar disorder (BD) are a matter of controversy in international child and adolescent psychiatry.

Inpatient rates for depressive disorders increased by 219.6% and for hyperkinetic disorder by 111.3%. Conduct disorders increased by 18.1%, considerably less than the 38.1% general rise for all mental disorders in children and adolescents.

BD inpatient admission represented only 0.22% of all mental disorder admissions in 2000 and 0.27% in 2007.\nAn elevation of inpatient admissions of BD in Germany in adolescents was detected, exceeding the general trend for increased mental disorder admissions. The results may indicate a higher clinical awareness and appreciation of mood symptoms at earlier ages and, in part, a reconceptualization of previously diagnosed psychotic disorders in youth. However, a diagnosis of BD in youngsters is still extremely rare in Germany. Diagnoses were based on the judgment of the treating physician.

Understanding the role of genetic polymorphisms within these neurotransmitter systems on brain phenotype is essential. This review tries to cover the literature on the impact of gene variants implicated in psychiatric disorders on serotonin, dopamine, and MAO-A radioligand binding in living humans. The majority of PET and SPECT studies investigated the role of polymorphisms within genes coding for the serotonin and dopamine transporters, the serotonin 1A receptor, and the dopamine D2 receptor on G protein coupled receptors or transporter proteins critically involved in serotonin or dopamine neurotransmission. Other studies investigated the impact of variants in genes for monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) or brain derived neurotrophic factor on monoamine transporters, receptors, or MAO-A activity. Two main findings in healthy subjects emerge from the current literature: one is an increased binding of the selective ligand [(11)C]DASB to serotonin transporters in subjects homozygous for the triallelic 5-HTTLPR LA allele. The other one is decreased binding of the radioligand [(11)C]raclopride to dopamine D2 receptors in D2 Taq1 A1 allele carriers. Other findings reported are highly interesting but require independent replication."}, {"Title": "Frequency and correlates of caregiver-reported sleep disturbances in a sample of persons with early dementia.", "Abstract": "To identify sleep disturbances in participants with subtypes of dementia and explore clinical correlates.\nCross-sectional.\nOutpatient clinics in western Norway and the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, Olmsted County, Minnesota.\nOne hundred fifty-one community-dwelling western Norway residents referred for geriatric medicine, geriatric psychiatry or neurology evaluation and 420 participants without dementia from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging.\nDementia was diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria. The Mayo Sleep Questionnaire, an interview to detect sleep disturbances, was administered to diagnose probable rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, probable periodic leg movements during sleep, probable restless legs syndrome, probable sleepwalking, probable sleep-related leg cramps, probable obstructive sleep apnea, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Insomnia was assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, an interview to detect neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia.\nSeventy-one percent of the participants with dementia and 55.7% of control participants had sleep disturbances (P=.001). Most frequently reported in the mild dementia participants were insomnia (29.9%), probable sleep-related leg cramps (24.1%), excessive daytime sleepiness (22.6%), probable restless legs syndrome (20.7%), and probable REM sleep behavior disorder (18.5%). There were more sleep-related problems reported in participants with Lewy body dementias (LBD) (dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia) than in those with Alzheimer's disease (P=.008).

Although enormous progress in the pathogenesis of IBS has been made, it is still poorly understood. A significant proportion of patients with IBS, report onset of symptoms following an episode of acute gastroenteritis. Aim of the study was to determine whether post infective irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) has histological or clinical features that are distinct from those of IBS patients with no history of preceding infection. A total of 50 consecutive IBS out patients and 10 healthy control subjects completed a questionnaire detailing symptoms, mode of onset, and previous psychiatry history. All underwent a full diagnostic workup including colonic biopsy and histopathology. Patients were divided according to onset of symptoms into post infectious IBS (PI-IBS, N=18) and non-post infectious IBS (non-PI-IBS, N=32) patients. Diarrhea predominantly occurred more frequently in PI- IBS (70%) than in non-PI-IBS (40%) patients (p<0.05). Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen from the sigmoid colon of the observed individuals showed a significant increase in the number of chronic inflammatory cells in both groups of IBS patients comparing to the control group (p<0.001). Lymphoid follicles were increased in both groups of IBS patients in comparison to control group (p<0.05). Mast cells were increased in IBS patients comparing to the control group (p<0.05) and it was significantly increased in the PI-IBS patients than the non-PI-IBS patients (p<0.001). Individuals with PI-IBS are clinically distinct subgroup characterized by predominant diarrheal symptoms and increased mast cells compared to those with non PI-IBS."}, {"Title": "Perceptions of diagnostic labels in forensic psychiatric practice: a survey of differences between nurses and other disciplines.", "Abstract": "This paper reports on a study of nurses' and non-nurses' perceptions of labels of mental illness and personality disorder in forensic services in the UK. The objectives of the study were to establish if differences in perceptions existed within, and between, the two groups of professionals. The research method was a survey design with 1,200 questionnaires distributed to nurses and 300 to other professionals in disciplines on forensic units in the UK, with response rates of 34.6% and 43%, respectively. The target population included clinical health care staff who had patient contact, including nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and occupational therapists. The results indicate that there are statistically significant differences within both nursing and non-nursing groups and also between the groups in relation to a \"management\" perspective for individuals labelled with a personality disorder and a \"clinical\" focus for individuals who are labelled as mentally ill. This paper adds research into the arena of forensic mental health in relation to the diagnostic labels of mental illness and personality disorders. It also adds evidence of a clinical response or a management response to such diagnostic labels which may impact on the practice of forensic psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[An observational study evaluating comorbidity between bipolar disorder and personality disorders].", "Abstract": "In literature there are a few studies evaluating comorbidity between bipolar disorder (type I, II and cyclothymic ) and personality disorders.

Engagement in persons with dementia: The concept and its measurement. American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry 7, 299-307]. Based on this framework, we tested the impact on engagement of the personal meaning of stimuli, specifically examining work-like stimuli, stimuli based on the person's identity, and gender role-based activities. We hypothesized that having such meanings will render stimuli more engaging than stimuli without these meanings. Participants were 193 residents of 7 Maryland nursing homes. All participants had a diagnosis of dementia. Results confirmed the hypotheses, demonstrating that the meaning of the stimulus impacts engagement shown by persons with dementia. Interventions that involve objects or tasks with meaning specific to the person with dementia will be more likely to engage that person.

The authors conducted a literature review to update clinicians about this issue and provide recommendations for proper methadone dosing. Studies eligible for inclusion in the review were retrieved from the PubMed database by searching for reports published between 1990 and September 2008 using the major medical subject headings Methadone (all fields) and dose. Only articles written in English were included. Additional reports were identified from the reference lists of retrieved articles and by manual review of the tables of contents of journals on drug of abuse included in the psychiatry and substance abuse subject category listing 2008 of the Journal Citation Reports. Abstracts of medical meetings were excluded. Twenty-four articles were included in the review. Twelve are randomized, controlled, or double-blind clinical trials, 10 are non-randomized and observational studies, and 2 are meta-analyses. Currently, the consensus is to have a goal for methadone dosing in the range of 60 to 100 mg daily. For patients who continue to use illicit opiates while prescribed this dose range, clinicians may consider doses greater than 100 mg daily. However, this is not the current consensus but rather is based on the limited promising data the authors have; it could be considered if the benefits outweigh the risks for some patients."}, {"Title": "Mechanisms of illness progression in the recurrent affective disorders.", "Abstract": "Along with genetic vulnerability, multiple environmental factors convey liability to illness progression, including: (1) distal and proximal stressors; (2) recurrence of episodes; and (3) comorbid cocaine abuse. Recurrence of each of these can increase responsivity (sensitize) to themselves and cross-sensitize to the two other factors and drive illness progression as seen clinically in increases in cycle acceleration, severity or duration of episodes, treatment refractoriness, disability, cognitive dysfunction, and premature death. Some mechanisms appear common to all three types of sensitization, such as decreases of brain-derived neuroprotective factor (BDNF) in hippocampus and blood, as well as increases in BDNF in the nucleus accumbens, suggesting the possibility that single treatments could ameliorate several of these factors at once. A potential example is N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which decreases bipolar affective illness severity (Berk et al. Biol Psychiatry 64:468\u2013475, 2008) and cocaine reinstatement and craving (Baker et al. Ann N Y Acad Sci 1003:349\u2013351, 2003; LaRowe et al. Am J Addict 15:105\u2013110, 2006). Mechanisms of illness progression also involve epigenetic changes and add further rationale to the existing empirical clinical evidence of the importance of early recognition, treatment, and prevention of affective episodes. Adequate treatment could prevent or ameliorate both the increases in pathological factors and erosion of adaptive factors that propel illness exacerbation and treatment resistance. This view of the sensitization and cross-sensitization among stressors, episodes, and abused substances should lead to a fundamental re-conceptualization of the recurrent affective disorders not as benign, isolated episodes of \u201cmental\u201d illness, but as severe, potentially progressive and lethal medical disorders of brain and body that deserve careful life-long monitoring and treatment."}, {"Title": "Use of intramuscular ziprasidone for the control of acute psychosis or agitation in an inpatient geriatric population: an open-label study.", "Abstract": "Objective.

It is natural that psychiatry should recognize the role of values, alongside facts, in all areas of clinical practice-diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation. There is a considerable concern on the development and the current form of evidence-based psychiatry whether this being sufficient in decision making in complex environment of mental health services of today. Psychiatric diagnosis derived from observed symptoms silence the interpersonal dialogues. The clinical encounter is narrowly focused on the forms instead of contents, meanings and background of human mental distress. We need a complementary value model, value-based approach, which runs parallel to evidence-based psychiatry. Value-based approach, like evidence-based, is a resource for effective decision-making in psychiatric practice. It starts from equal respect for all values, individual patients, their families and communities, and the recognition of the fact that various value terms already exist in DSM or ICD diagnostic systems. To respect values, psychiatry must step down to be equal with service users. Current development of mental health services are based on the principles of patient centered decision-making and multidisciplinary teamwork. This should provide basis for value-based as well as fact-based psychiatric practice."}, {"Title": "International consensus statement on major depressive disorder.", "Abstract": "Because considerable variability exists between countries in the management of major depressive disorder, experts in psychiatry gathered for the International Consensus Group on Depression to outline a universal treatment algorithm for this illness.

Specific recommendations were made by the consensus group for screening for, diagnosing, and treating depression, which include periodically screening all patients for depression, completing a differential diagnosis of depression, referring to a psychiatric specialist if needed, establishing a therapeutic alliance with patients and their families, choosing and optimizing the dose of appropriate antidepressants based on individual patient's needs, and incorporating nonpharmacologic treatment strategies as necessary."}, {"Title": "Major depressive disorder treatment guidelines in Japan.", "Abstract": "Japanese treatment guidelines, consensus guidelines, and treatment algorithms for managing patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have been developed and/or updated in the past decade. The treatment guidelines, which are evidence-based, are the most detailed of the 3 types of guidance; they describe how to establish a treatment plan, treatment methods, and special problems such as intractable depression and suicide. The Japanese consensus guidelines were compiled from the results of a survey about treatment choices in MDD that was sent to members of the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors were the most common first-line treatments, followed by tricyclic antidepressants and tetracyclic antidepressants. The consensus guidelines are not evidence-based but are practical and easy to use. The Japanese treatment algorithm for MDD is a flowchart created in conjunction with the International Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project.

While the guidelines are all evidence-based, certain factors can influence differences in specific recommendations, such as the consensus group's composition, underlying mandates, and cultural attitudes. The similarities and differences among 6 sets of guidelines from Europe and the Americas published in the past decade are reviewed here (American Psychiatric Association, British Association for Psychopharmacology, Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Texas Medication Algorithm Project, and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry). In the guidelines, mild depression has the most variance in treatment recommendations; some, but not all, guidelines suggest that it may resolve with exercise or watchful waiting, but psychotherapy or antidepressants could be used if initial efforts fail. Moderate and severe major depression carry broadly similar recommendations among the guidelines. First-line treatment recommendations for moderate major depressive disorder include antidepressant monotherapy, psychotherapy, and the combination of both. Severe depression may require the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, electroconvulsive therapy, or the combination of an antidepressant and psychotherapy. Benzodiazepines play a very limited role in the treatment of depression; if the patient has catatonic depression, acutely suicidal depression, or depression with symptoms of anxiety, agitation, or insomnia, benzodiazepines are recommended by some guidelines for short-term treatment only."}, {"Title": "\"Positive\" results increase down the Hierarchy of the Sciences.", "Abstract": "The hypothesis of a Hierarchy of the Sciences with physical sciences at the top, social sciences at the bottom, and biological sciences in-between is nearly 200 years old. This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the \"hardness\" of scientific research--i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors--is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a \"positive\" (full or partial) or \"negative\" support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in \"softer\" sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status of the social sciences against claims that they are completely subjective, by showing that, when they adopt a scientific approach to discovery, they differ from the natural sciences only by a matter of degree."}, {"Title": "Maras powder usage among Turkish psychiatric outpatients.", "Abstract": "A kind of smokeless tobacco known as Maras powder, which is used in the southeastern region of Turkey, causes nicotine dependence.

We especially focus on the methodological prerequisites and particular compounds and the endophenotype construct in a case study of bipolar disorders. It is discussed as a mediating level between the genetic causation and the environmental influences in the mental disorder causation. This epigenetic area includes such constructs as cognitive neuropsychological markers, neurotrophic proteins impairment, instability of circadian rhythms (other chronobiological disturbances as well), deregulation of the motivation and reward mechanisms, changes in the GABA metabolism, symptom provocation with \"psychotomymetic\" agents, etc. Eventually the core ideas of the original validation theory in comparison with the endophenotype concept are shown as milestones of the novel integration of neurobiology and psychiatry. The major issue posed in the endophenotype debate concerns \"the independence from the state\". According to the formulation of Hassler and Drevets this notion indicates the presentation of the endophenotype regardless of the activity of the disorder, i.e., its presence even in the pre-morbid and remission periods. In the present study we argue that there is another dimension of \"state independence\" to be assessed. The validation theory in particular defines the entire space-and-time sequence disposition of the endophenotype indicators, e.g. cognitive-psychological and neuroimaging. It is well known that mental states, whether normal or pathological, are very dynamical, just as their neurophysiological correlates are. By this reason it is necessary to explore their relationships simultaneously."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric health care provider attitudes towards implantable medication.", "Abstract": "Medication nonadherence is a major problem in psychiatry.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether patient self-reported severity of FM is associated with severity of pain and sleep interference and the presence of core co-morbidities.\nWe recruited individuals >or= 18 years of age with a clinician-confirmed diagnosis of FM >or= 3 months and a current pain rating >2 on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS). Patients completed a questionnaire by mail in which they self-rated their FM severity (very mild, mild, moderate, and severe), their current pain severity and extent of sleep interference (NRS; mild, 0-3; moderate, 4-6, severe, 7-10), and provided information (yes/no) on the presence of core comorbidities (symptoms of depression, anxiety, sleep problems, back pain, neck pain) and medication use for FM. The core symptoms of FM were stratified to assist with patient characterization. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to explore the relationship between self-reported FM severity and continuous variables (pain severity and sleep interference), and Mantel-Haenszel chi-square analysis was used to evaluate the trend in the proportions of patients reporting use of medications and core symptoms of FM by severity of FM. To complement patient-reported FM severity and to understand physicians' perspectives, a survey was performed among 28 physician specialists (rheumatology, neurology, anesthesiology/pain management, family practice, internal medicine, and psychiatry) to determine what they assessed when evaluating FM severity in clinical practice.\nThe population (N = 129) of FM patients was predominantly female (89.1%), with a mean age of 49.4 +/- 11.0 years, and 81.4% reported duration >or= 2 years. Self-reported FM severity was moderate/severe in 86.0% of patients; mean current pain score was 6.40 +/- 2.19 (moderate), and mean sleep interference score was 7.28 +/- 2.23 (severe). Greater FM severity was significantly associated with higher levels of current pain and sleep interference (p < 0.0001), the proportion of patients reporting FM medication use (p = 0.0001), and the presence of core comorbidities (p < 0.05). Pain, functional disability, and fatigue severity were ranked as the top three criteria by the highest proportion of physicians when evaluating FM severity.\nWith higher self-reported FM severity, patients have greater pain and sleep interference as well as increased frequency of core comorbidities.

Having been wounded in the Great War in 1915, his right forearm was amputated, and he very quickly began to suffer from stump pain and phantom hand phenomena, which persisted until his death. Following his amputation he became a left-handed writer. Half a century later, between 1956 and his death in 1961, he suffered two strokes which gradually paralyzed the left side of his body. After the second stroke in 1958, he became a 'handless writer', also partially losing his ability to express himself orally. Although the works of Blaise Cendrars portray characters with serious mental disorders, they also contain characters with real neurological diseases, such as the trepanated aphasic in 'J'ai Saign\u00e9'. The most famous of these is undoubtedly Moravagine, the protagonist of the eponymous novel, who presents acute behavioral disturbances. We learn from the autopsy report that he was in fact suffering from a brain tumor. On several occasions, including the complex case of Moravagine, and by presenting his ideas on hysteria, Blaise Cendrars, in his own way, addressed the somewhat fuzzy boundary that exists between psychiatry and neurology."}, {"Title": "Using illness scripts to teach clinical reasoning skills to medical students.", "Abstract": "Most medical students learn clinical reasoning skills informally during clinical rotations that have varying quality of supervision. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine if a workshop that uses \"illness scripts\" could improve students' clinical reasoning skills when making diagnoses of patients portrayed in written scenarios.\nIn 2007--2008, 53 fourth-year medical students were randomly assigned to either a family medicine (intervention) or psychiatry (control) clerkship at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Students in the intervention group participated in a 3-hour workshop on clinical reasoning that used illness scripts. The workshop was conducted with small-group teaching using a Web-based set of clinical reasoning problems, individualized feedback, and demonstration of tutors' reasoning aloud. The effectiveness of the intervention was assessed using the Diagnostic Thinking Inventory (DTI) and the measurement of individual students' performance in solving clinical reasoning problems (CRP).\nThe post-intervention overall DTI scores between groups were similar (mean difference 0, 95% confidence interval [CI]= -7.4 to 7.4). However, the total scores on the CRP assessment were 14% (95% CI=8% to 21%) higher in the intervention group than in controls.\nA workshop on illness scripts may have some benefit for improving diagnostic performance in clinical reasoning problems."}, {"Title": "Prenatal alcohol exposure and autistic spectrum disorders--a population-based prospective study of 80,552 children and their mothers.", "Abstract": "To examine whether maternal alcohol intake, including binge drinking (intake > or =5 drinks, equivalent to 60 g pure ethanol on a single occasion), is associated with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and infantile autism.\nParticipants were 80,552 children and their mothers enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort from 1996 to 2002. Alcohol consumption was obtained by self-report during pregnancy. Information on ASD was obtained from the Danish Central Psychiatry Register. Follow-up ended on February 2008. Data were analysed by means of Cox regression.\nIn total, 401 children were diagnosed with ASD and 157 with infantile autism. No association was found between average alcohol consumption and ASD or infantile autism, respectively. For binge drinking, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for ASD was 0.72 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53-0.97] among women who binge drank once during pregnancy compared with women who did not binge drink. The corresponding HR for infantile autism was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.36-1.02). However, the HR for ASD was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.51-1.36) when restricting the analysis to first-time pregnancies conceived within 6 months of trying. No estimate was made for infantile autism due to low number of cases. No association was seen for more than one binge episode and for the timing of binge drinking.\nOur findings do not support that a low prenatal alcohol exposure increases the risk of ASD or infantile autism. The lower risk for women who binge drank once during pregnancy is most likely non-causal."}, {"Title": "The sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression (STAR*D) trial: a review.", "Abstract": "The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial is the largest open-label, pragmatic trial that has been undertaken to examine the treatment of major depressive disorder. At a cost of US$35 million over 6 years, STAR*D sought to test the effectiveness both of pharmacotherapy and of cognitive therapy, and to ascertain whether certain treatments are more optimal after one or more failed trials.\nPatients (n = 2876) who presented to either a psychiatry or family practice setting seeking treatment for depression were included in the STAR*D analysis. In the 4 levels of STAR*D, patients were randomized to various treatment monotherapies, combinations, or augmentation strategies. The primary outcome was remission, based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes were response, as measured by clinician and patient self-report as well as various measures of patients' level of function and (or) quality of life.\nRemission rates for treatment levels 1 to 2 and 3 to 4 were 18% to 30% and 7% to 25%, respectively. There was no difference in effectiveness between any treatments at any treatment level. Patients with longer index episodes, more concurrent psychiatric or general medical disorders, and (or) lower measures of baseline function were less likely to achieve remission. There were no major differences between outcomes in patients treated in primary, compared with specialist care, nor were there significant differences between depression rating scores obtained through clinician ratings, compared with self-report.\nResults of the STAR*D trial have shed important light on the effectiveness of current treatment strategies for patients with depression."}, {"Title": "Brain stimulation in psychiatry and its effects on cognition.", "Abstract": "From the advent of electroconvulsive therapy in the 1930s to the emergence of magnetic seizure therapy in the 2000s, the refinement of brain stimulation in psychiatry has been largely motivated by a desire to achieve clinical efficacy and eliminate cognitive adverse effects. As a result of these efforts, a clinically efficacious brain stimulation technique that does not negatively affect cognition could soon be available. In the course of developing a 'cognitively safe' brain stimulation technique, potential methods to enhance various aspects of cognition have also emerged.

In recent years much work has been dedicated to studying the problems of conducting research in psychiatry, mainly in schizophrenia patients. In an attempt to replicate previous findings and extend results beyond schizophrenia, we interviewed patients suffering from schizophrenia or depression in a large academic centre concerning their attitudes towards psychiatric research. Ninety-five patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (48) or depression (47) completed the \"Hamburg General Attitudes to Psychiatric Research Questionnaire\" self-report instrument. Furthermore, demographic and clinical data were collected. Illness severity was evaluated using Clinical Global Impression and Global Assessment of Functioning scores. In general, patients approved of psychiatric research, and attitudes towards specific areas of research and research methods were rather positive. There were no significant differences between the two diagnostic groups regarding reasons for participation or non-participation in a clinical trial. The theoretical willingness to participate in studies was highest for studies using a questionnaire. Receiving sufficient information about a study before taking part was stated to be highly important. Our findings confirm and extend those of other groups.

The following search terms were used: transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS, repetitive TMS, psychiatry, mental disorder, psychiatric disorder, anxiety disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, catatonia, mania, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychosis, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome, bulimia nervosa, and addiction.\nData were obtained from randomized, sham-controlled studies of rTMS treatment for depression (34 studies), auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH, 7 studies), negative symptoms in schizophrenia (7 studies), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, 3 studies). Studies of rTMS versus electroconvulsive treatment (ECT, 6 studies) for depression were meta-analyzed.\nStandardized mean effect sizes of rTMS versus sham were computed based on pretreatment-posttreatment comparisons.\nThe mean weighted effect size of rTMS versus sham for depression was 0.55 (P < .001). Monotherapy with rTMS was more effective than rTMS as adjunctive to antidepressant medication. ECT was superior to rTMS in the treatment of depression (mean weighted effect size -0.47, P = .004). In the treatment of AVH, rTMS was superior to sham treatment, with a mean weighted effect size of 0.54 (P < .001). The mean weighted effect size for rTMS versus sham in the treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia was 0.39 (P = .11) and for OCD, 0.15 (P = .52).

Currently, few clinical and ethical standards exist for the use of these new tests. As a step toward building consensus about testing, we assessed the attitudes and practices of psychiatrists at 3 academic departments of psychiatry where pharmacogenetic testing is clinically available. We hypothesized that testing would be used primarily in treatment-resistant illness and that clinicians would believe such tests carried little risk.\nResidents and faculty at 3 departments of psychiatry considered to be \"early adopters\" of pharmacogenetic testing were invited during the academic year 2006-2007 to complete an Internet-based survey, including questions regarding clinical practices and opinions about testing utility, risks, and necessary safeguards.\nThe 75 respondents had ordered pharmacogenetic testing a mean of 20.86 times in the previous 12 months. Testing was judged most useful in cases of treatment-resistant depression and medication intolerance. There was a lack of consensus about the risks of testing, particularly the risk of secondary information about disease susceptibility. Respondents endorsed the use of several safeguards, including confidentiality, pretest and posttest counseling, and informed consent, but consensus about other safeguards was lacking. Women and those who had not ordered testing in the prior year were more concerned about risks and need for safeguards than were men and those who had recently ordered testing.\nPhysicians at early adopting departments of psychiatry endorsed the clinical utility of pharmacogenetic testing and the use of some patient safeguards, but showed a lack of consensus about other safeguards and risks."}, {"Title": "Law & psychiatry: Genetic discrimination in mental disorders: the impact of the genetic information nondiscrimination act.", "Abstract": "Genetics is one of the most active areas of research on mental disorders.

The purpose of the study was to obtain more systematic information about ECT training.\nA survey was e-mailed to directors of all accredited psychiatry residency programs in the United States and Puerto Rico in early to mid 2008, requesting information regarding their didactic and clinical instruction in ECT and estimates of number of treatments provided by their institutions.\nResponses were obtained from 91 training programs. Of these programs, 75% reported that some clinical exposure to ECT was required of their residents, but 37% estimated that the typical resident would participate in fewer than 10 treatments and 27% estimated that the typical resident would care for fewer than 5 patients receiving ECT. Most programs devoted less than 4 hours of lecture time to ECT. Most respondents believed that ECT was underused nationally; this perception did not differ based on the theoretical orientation of the training program.\nThis study suggests that resident education in ECT varies considerably between programs but is often less than that suggested by the American Psychiatric Association's Task Force."}, {"Title": "Electroconvulsive therapy clinical database: a standardized approach in tertiary care psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Across health care disciplines research reflects the usefulness of integrating computer technology into administrative and clinical practices. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) researchers are often interested in examining 3 primary areas: patient characteristics, treatment characteristics, and treatment outcomes. Generating reports and conducting research analysis via the traditional patient chart review are a time-consuming and costly method. At Riverview Hospital, a tertiary care psychiatric hospital, the active use of a clinical database for patients receiving ECT allows for detailed treatment tracking and evaluation of pretreatment and posttreatment patient outcome measures. Initially, designed as part of a quality improvement process to readily access patient information and generate periodic reports, the ECT clinical database is now a central resource for ECT-specific patient, treatment, and outcome tracking. The relevance, design, content variables, and subsequent functions of the entry and storage of ECT-related administrative, treatment, outcome, and patient factors are clearly outlined and discussed.

The objective of this article is to review the literature on medication errors in psychiatry. We completed a comprehensive search of both peer- and non-peer-reviewed articles that investigated medication errors in psychiatry. Our primary focus was to examine patient-, provider- and system-related factors that contributed to medication errors. Due to differences in research design and denominators used to determine error rates, the reported prevalence rates of medication errors in psychiatry vary widely. Patient-related factors identified as contributing to medication errors included non-adherence to medication, failure of patients to inform their various care providers about the medications they are taking and symptoms of psychiatric illnesses. Provider-related factors identified as contributing to medication errors were also identified and included clinical practices associated with prescribing, transcription, dispensing, administration and monitoring. Finally, the healthcare system also has a major role to play in reducing medication errors by ensuring seamless continuity of care, mandating medication reconciliation programmes, ensuring adequate clinical pharmacy services and supporting a nonpunitive medication error reporting system. Although the literature raises awareness of these specific contributing factors, there is still a great need for more systematic evaluations of the problem including root cause analysis.

In particular, these species can offer flexible genetic 'tool kits' that can be used to explore the expression and function of candidate genes in different brain regions. Very small animals also offer efficiencies with respect to high-throughput screening programs.

A nonrandom distribution of symptoms suggests a common mechanism. Symptom clusters (SCs) were considered part of various syndromes in the early years of medicine. The SC concept in clinical medicine is old. Symptom clusters were commonly described in the psychology/psychiatry and neurology literature. Symptom cluster may be defined either clinically or statistically. Statistically derived clusters can differ from clinically defined clusters. The clinical importance of statistically derived clusters is unclear. Pain-insomnia-fatigue and pain-depression-fatigue are commonly recognized clinical clusters. Nausea-vomiting and anxiety-depression are also statistically observed clusters. The longitudinal stability of clusters is unknown. Certain SCs, appear to have a greater adverse influence on outcomes (such as performance status and survival) than others. Comorbidities probably influence symptoms at different levels, but their effect on cancer clusters is unknown. Comprehensive symptom assessment is crucial to cluster identification. The potential use of the cluster concept to abbreviate symptom assessment tools needs validation. Symptom cluster can be disease and/or treatment related and may change as individuals undergo antitumor therapies. Polypharmacy in symptom management is frequent but could be minimized if 1 drug could be used to treat cluster symptoms. Symptom cluster appears to vary with the assessment tool, disease stage, symptom domain used to cluster, cluster methodology, and number of symptoms assessed. The validity and reliability of SCs need universally accepted statistical methods, assessment tools, and symptom domains. For now, nausea-vomiting is recognized as a consistent cluster across multiple studies. Pain-depression-fatigue and pain-insomnia-fatigue are also well recognized. Symptom clusters may help in cancer diagnosis, symptom management, and prognostication. However, the cluster method, reliability, and validity need to be established before assessment or treatment guidelines are established. Symptom clusters require further research before becoming part of routine medical symptom assessment and management."}, {"Title": "How psychogenic is dystonia? Views from past to present.", "Abstract": "In the last few centuries, there has been a constant sway between organic and psychogenic explanations for dystonia. In the current study, we investigate this history, assuming the perspective of a spectrum from organic to psychogenic, between which ideas were moving. We have focussed on (i) primary generalized dystonia, (ii) cervical dystonia, (iii) writer's cramp and (iv) fixed dystonia related to complex regional pain syndrome. We have studied medical texts published since the 19th century and their references. Jean-Martin Charcot advocated the concept of hysteria, disorders in which, besides predisposition, environmental factors were involved in their pathogenesis. Sigmund Freud introduced psychoanalysis as an explanatory therapy for psychic disorders. Previous theories, together with the lack of an organic substrate for dystonia, made a strong case for psychogenic explanations. Consequently, many dystonia patients were told that they suffered from psychological conflicts and were treated for them. However, after the description of new hereditary cases in the 1950s, the limited efficacy of psychotherapy in torsion dystonia, the effects of surgical treatments and the lesion studies in the 1960s, more physicians became convinced of the organic nature. The culminating point was the discovery of the DYT1 gene in 1997. In the meantime, experts had already convinced the neurological community that cervical dystonia and writer's cramp were focal dystonias, i.e. minor forms of generalized dystonia, and therefore organic disorders. In contrast, the pathophysiology of fixed dystonia related to complex regional pain syndrome remained controversial. Knowledge of this history, which played on the border between neurology and psychiatry, is instructive and reflects the difficulty in discriminating between them. Today, new insights from functional imaging and neurophysiological studies again challenge the interpretation of these disorders, while the border between psychogenic and organic has become more blurred. Abnormalities of sensorimotor integration and cortical excitability that are currently supposed to be the underlying cause of dystonia bring us back to Sherringtonian physiology. We suggest that this may lead to a common explanation of the four afflictions of which we have traced the history."}, {"Title": "A screening tool to medically clear psychiatric patients in the emergency department.", "Abstract": "Emergency physicians are frequently called on to medically clear patients presenting with a psychiatric complaint.

The screening tool consists of a series of historical and physical examination criteria derived from the literature intended to identify patients who have a psychiatric manifestation of an organic disease. The physician filled out the screening form and if the proper conditions were met, the patient was transferred to Psychiatry without further laboratory or imaging studies. We reviewed the charts of both the ED visit and the psychiatric crisis center visit to determine if any of the patients required further medical treatment or a medical admission rather than a psychiatric admission.\nFive hundred consecutive ED patient charts were reviewed. Fifteen of the corresponding charts from the psychiatric center could not be found. Of the remaining 485 patients, 6 patients were sent back to the ED for further evaluation. After laboratory work and imaging, none of these 6 patients required more than an outpatient prescription.\nThe screening tool proved useful in determining if a psychiatric patient needed further medical evaluation beyond a history and physical examination before transfer for a psychiatric evaluation."}, {"Title": "Conceptual challenges and directions for social neuroscience.", "Abstract": "Social neuroscience has been enormously successful and is making major contributions to fields ranging from psychiatry to economics.

The aim of this study was to assess the course of health-related quality of life, cognitive and emotional change during the six months after elective CABG, and to investigate how cognitive impairments, depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms were related to quality of life. In a prospective study, we followed up for 6 months 138 of the original 147 patients who had undergone elective CABG surgery. Preoperatively, and at 6 months after surgery, a series of psychometric observer-rating and self-rating scales were administered to evaluate cognitive functioning (SKT), depressive symptoms (BDI), posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS-10), and health-related quality of life (SF-36 Health Status Questionnaire). The measurements of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) indicated significantly higher SF-36 values on all of the eight health-related domains from preoperative to 6-month follow-up assessments. However, at 6-month follow-up, patients with clinical depression had significantly lower SF-36 values on all of the eight health-related domains when compared with patients without depression. Also, at 6-month follow-up, patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) had significantly lower SF-36 values on six of the eight SF-36 health categories when compared with patients without PTSD. Finally, at 6-month follow-up, patients with cognitive deficits had significantly lower SF-36 values on physical functioning when compared with patients without cognitive impairments.

Anthropometric measurements and laboratory testing were conducted. The clinical diagnoses were based on chart review, and developmental and treatment history was obtained from the medical record. Volumetric BMD of the ultradistal radius was measured using peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and areal BMD of the lumbar spine was estimated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.\nHyperprolactinemia was present in 49% of 83 boys (n = 41) treated with risperidone for a mean of 2.9 years. Serum testosterone concentration increased with pubertal status but was not affected by hyperprolactinemia. As expected, bone mineral content and BMD increased with sexual maturity. After adjusting for the stage of sexual development and height and BMI z scores, serum prolactin was negatively associated with trabecular volumetric BMD at the ultradistal radius (P < .03). Controlling for relevant covariates, we also found treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to be associated with lower trabecular BMD at the radius (P = .03) and BMD z score at the lumbar spine (P < .05). These findings became more marked when the analysis was restricted to non-Hispanic white patients. Of 13 documented fractures, 3 occurred after risperidone and SSRIs were started, and none occurred in patients with hyperprolactinemia.\nThis is the first study to link risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia and SSRI treatment to lower BMD in children and adolescents. Future research should evaluate the longitudinal course of this adverse event to determine its temporal stability and whether a higher fracture rate ensues."}, {"Title": "Addiction research centres and the nurturing of creativity.

Begun as an National Institutes of Health (NIH) research center within a Department of Psychiatry and focused solely upon alcohol and aging, early work emphasized treatment efficacy, differential outcome studies and characterization of the neurophysiological and behavioral manifestations of chronic alcoholism. Over the last 15 years, UMARC has extended its research focus along a number of dimensions: its developmental reach has been extended etiologically by studies of risk early in the life span, and by way of work on earlier screening and the development of early, brief treatment interventions. The addiction focus has expanded to include other drugs of abuse. Levels of analysis have also broadened, with work on the molecular genetics and brain neurophysiology underlying addictive processes, on one hand, and examination of the role of the social environment in long-term course of disorder on the other hand. Activities have been facilitated by several research training programs and by collaborative relationships with other universities around the United States and in Poland. Since 2002, a program for research infrastructure development and collaboration has been ongoing, initially with Poland and more recently with Ukraine, Latvia and Slovakia. A blueprint for the future includes expanded characterization of the neurobiology and genetics of addictive processes, the developmental environment, as well as programmatic work to address the public health implications of our ability to identify risk for disorder very early in life."}, {"Title": "Seeing America--diary of a drug-focused study tour made in 1967.", "Abstract": "In 1965 the British government was forced to admit that the country had an escalating heroin problem, with the supply coming mainly from prescribing by private practitioners. Within the official responses to what was seen at that time as a very worrying public health situation was the decision to fund the setting-up of the Addiction Research Unit (ARU) at the Institute of Psychiatry, London. The US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) generously sponsored a study tour for the nominated director of the ARU shortly before the opening of the British research centre. Extensive contemporaneous diary notes of a visit included contact with administrators, researchers, clinicians, parish priests, narcotic agents and addicts themselves. From a mass of often conflicting advice, some insights could be derived. In particular, these included the need for an awareness of any country's way of dealing with drug problems as a dynamic, multi-factorial total system--a holistic 'national response'. A further conclusion was to see policy itself as a complex subject for analysis: drug policy should be as much an issue for research as drug taking. Besides these broad conclusions, the experience provided many specific leads to development of a British addiction research programme, and fostered professional friendships of immeasurable worth."}, {"Title": "Update on the use of MR for assessment and diagnosis of psychiatric diseases.", "Abstract": "The lack of quantitative objective measures of psychiatric diseases such as anxiety and depression is one reason that the causative factors of psychiatric diseases remain obscure. The fact that human behavior is complex and cannot be easily tested in laboratories or reproduced in animal models further complicates our understanding of psychiatric diseases. During the past 3 decades, several magnetic resonance (MR)-based tools such as MR morphometry, diffusion-tensor imaging, functional MR imaging, and MR spectroscopy have yielded findings that provide tangible evidence of the neurobiologic manifestations of psychiatric diseases. In this article, we summarize major MR findings of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder as examples to illustrate the promise that MR techniques hold for not only revealing the neurobiological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders but also enhancing our understanding of healthy human behavior. However, many radiologists remain skeptical about the diagnostic value of MR in psychiatric disease. Many inconsistent, noncomparable reports in the literature contribute to this skepticism. The aims of this article are to (a) illustrate the most reported MR findings of major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder; (b) inform radiologists of the potential roles of MR imaging in psychiatric imaging research; and (c) discuss several confounding factors in the design and interpretation of MR imaging findings in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder following traumatic amputation.", "Abstract": "Traumatic amputations are important causes of acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Twenty-two patients with traumatic limb amputation who were treated in our institution were retrospectively evaluated. During the early post-traumatic period, the patients were observed to determine whether they needed any psychiatric supportive treatment. During the follow-up period, after the sixth month from the trauma, the patients were referred to the psychiatry department and they were evaluated to determine whether they needed any psychiatric supportive treatment, by clinical psychiatric examination and use of the 'post-traumatic stress disorder scale' (Clinician Administered Post traumatic Scale, or CAPS). Twenty-one (95.5%) of 22 patients were male, one (4.5%) female. Mean age of the patients was 40.8 years (range: 15 to 69).

Among the classic pentad of signs and symptoms associated with compartment syndrome, pain that is out of proportion to the injury is often cited as the earliest and most sensitive. We present a case report of an atypical presentation of compartment syndrome of the leg in which a patient taking lithium for bipolar disorder did not report pain out of proportion to the injury mechanism. Lithium has been implicated in altering pain perception and increasing the tolerance and threshold for pain, but this has not been widely reported in the orthopedic literature. In addition to compartment syndrome that was painless, the patient presented with 2 additional atypical findings. She presented with compartment syndrome that was atraumatic and isolated to only 1 out of the 4 compartments of the leg. A compartment syndrome that is painless, atraumatic, and isolated to a single compartment represents an unusual triad of atypical findings that has not been previously reported. With unusual presentations of compartment syndrome, there is an increased risk of late or unrecognized diagnosis, consequently increasing the likelihood of significant nerve damage or muscle necrosis. Clinicians have historically applied a higher level of scrutiny to patients who were deemed \"obtunded,\" that is, those in whom an assessment of pain cannot be reliably determined. In the past, obtunded patients have included intubated or comatose patients, infants and children, mentally disabled patients, and patients with altered mental status, nerve injury, or distracting injuries. Based on evidence from the psychiatry and anesthesia literatures, we propose that patients taking lithium should be added to this list of \"obtunded\" patients in whom a reliable assessment of pain may not be possible."}, {"Title": "Infection or idiosyncratic reaction to antiepileptic drugs?", "Abstract": "Idiosyncratic reactions are serious, unpredicted adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs which are in use in psychiatry as mood stabilizers.

Niacin, a B-complex vitamin, induces prostaglandin synthesis, vasodilatation, and skin flushing when applied as a solution on the skin or taken orally. In schizophrenia, diminished or absent skin response to niacin represents a robust finding.\nAttenuated niacin skin-flush response has been analysed as a potential biochemical marker of impaired prostaglandin signaling in schizophrenia. Diminished skin redness after topical application of niacin might be caused by a reduced level of the precursor arachidonic acid in the peripheral membranes, increased activity of the enzyme phospholipase A2, abnormal expression of niacin or prostaglandin receptors, or poor vasomotor activity of cutaneous capillary walls. Heritability estimates established in several studies support niacin skin flush response as a vulnerability trait for the development of psychosis. However, the exact mechanism of a reduced skin flush, the possible influence of the long-term use of antipsychotics, and the usefulness of the test for diagnostic purpose are not clear yet.\nNiacin skin flush test is a simple, non-invasive and easily replicable method in the research of schizophrenia. The studies investigating niacin flushing in schizophrenia are numerous but incoherent regarding methods of niacin application and evaluation of the results. New studies, controlling adequately for age, sex, drug abuse, diet, as well as genetic factors that may influence the intensity and reaction time, are necessary to clarify the usefulness of niacin testing in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Commentary: conceptualizing the forensic psychiatry report.", "Abstract": "Relatively little attention has been paid to training forensic evaluators to prepare expert reports.

To a psychiatrist conducting a forensic evaluation, the evaluee's Internet use can be relevant in nearly all aspects of the analysis. An evaluee's Internet presence may help to confirm, corroborate, refute, or elaborate on the psychiatrist's general impression of the person. Questions about the individual's choice of screen names, activities, images, and phrases can be valuable conversational tools to increase candor and self-disclosure, even among less cooperative evaluees. Difficulties in mood or affect regulation, problems with thought process or content, and impaired impulse control may be apparent in the evaluee's behavior in various Internet forums-for example, hostile or provocative behavior in social forums or excessive use of gaming or shopping websites. Discussions about the evaluee's behavior on the Internet can help the psychiatrist to assess for impaired insight and judgment. Perceptual disturbances, such as derealization and depersonalization, may be related to an evaluee's overidentification with the virtual world to the neglect of real-life needs and responsibilities. Furthermore, digital evidence can be especially useful in assessments of impairment, credibility, and dangerousness or risk, particularly when the evaluee is uncooperative or unreliable in the face-to-face psychiatric examination.

The trauma-informed care perspective suggests that the use of S/R with previously abused inpatients may result in retraumatization due to mental associations between childhood trauma and the experience during S/R. Thus, though one would expect to see efforts on the part of inpatient psychiatric facilities to limit S/R of previously abused inpatients, research suggests that trauma victims may be more likely to experience S/R. The current study sought to clarify this possibility by examining whether presence or absence and chronicity of childhood sexual and physical abuse differed among three groups of adult inpatients (N = 622) residing at a mid-Western state psychiatric hospital. These groups are empirically derived on the basis of dramatic differences in the patterning of their exposure to S/R over the course of hospitalization. Results of Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests suggest that the classes did not significantly differ in presence or absence and chronicity of childhood sexual or physical abuse when male and female inpatients were analyzed separately.

We describe the development and evaluation of several such agents designed for health counseling and behavioral-change interventions, in which a therapeutic alliance is established with patients in order to enhance the efficacy of the intervention. We also discuss the promise of using such agents as adjuncts to clinical psychiatry, a range of possible applications, and some of the challenges and ethical issues in developing and fielding them in psychiatric interventions."}, {"Title": "Subject of focus: the lives of emigrants. D\u00fcsseldorf-Berlin-Ankara-Washington: the life of Edith Weigert (n\u00e9e Vowinckel) (1894-1982).", "Abstract": "Edith Weigert (-Vowinckel) became a member of the German Psychoanalytic Society (DPG) in 1929, fled from the National-Socialists in 1935 to Turkey, and then emigrated three years later to the United States, where she played an especially important role as lecturer, teaching and supervising analyst. She published numerous scientific essays. She took on uncommon positions in more ways than one: as a female student of medicine, as an analyst in a hospital setting, as a non-Jewish emigrant, a pioneer of psychoanalysis in Turkey, and last but not least, as an autonomous individual in the conflict between classical-orthodox and liberal-eclectic schools of thought in the United States. She witnessed meaningful developments in the history of psychoanalysis during her stay at the Berlin Institute and in Washington, where she encountered representatives of different theoretical movements. As a classical Freudian psychoanalyst in Berlin and trained psychiatrist at the Charit\u00e9, she was receptive to new and interdisciplinary influences during the entire course of her life: these include Harry Stack Sullivan's interpersonal psychiatry, Frieda Fromm-Reichmann's psychotherapy, and the philosophy of European existentialism. All of these elements make her historical and biographical account an exciting and worthwhile project. In the following pages, a portrait emerges of a person who strived to emphasize commonality rather than difference within her own professional community as well as on a theoretical level of psychoanalytic practice during a time in history marked by conflict and division. A special portrait developed during the course of my research, one that reveals an image that is inconsistent, but in a very customary way."}, {"Title": "[The health economics of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Germany. Part 1: Health care utilization and cost of illness].", "Abstract": "In the German region of Nordbaden, 5% of children (aged 7-12 years) and 1.3% of adolescents (aged 13-19 years) were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in 2003. About two thirds of these patients were not seen by a physician specialized in psychiatry. Now the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany (Kassenaerztliche Bundesvereinigung, KBV) has developed a proposal for the integrated provision of care for these patients, combining a guidelines-oriented multidisciplinary approach with a system of quality assurance. Against this background, currently available ADHD-related data are presented, covering epidemiology, comorbidity and differential diagnosis, health care utilization, and cost of illness. According to administrative data analyses from Nordbaden, direct medical costs for patients with ADHD, from the perspective of statutory health insurance (SHI), exceed those of matched controls by a factor of >2.5. On this basis, ADHD-related expenditures of the German SHI may be estimated at around EUR 260 million in 2003, and almost certainly will have continued to grow further since. In addition to this, a diagnosis of ADHD is associated with substantial indirect cost. Although the literature on the burden of ADHD is incomplete, it seems plausible that the cost of illness might be comparable to that reported for alcohol and addiction disorders. Thus we anticipate an increasing relevance of formal health economic evaluations of health care programs offered to patients with ADHD."}, {"Title": "Effects of a genome-wide supported psychosis risk variant on neural activation during a theory-of-mind task.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is associated with marked deficits in theory of mind (ToM), a higher-order form of social cognition representing the thoughts, emotions and intentions of others. Altered brain activation in the medial prefrontal cortex and temporo-parietal cortex during ToM tasks has been found in patients with schizophrenia, but the relevance of these neuroimaging findings for the heritable risk for schizophrenia is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that activation of the ToM network is altered in healthy risk allele carriers of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1344706 in the gene ZNF804A, a recently discovered risk variant for psychosis with genome-wide support. In all, 109 healthy volunteers of both sexes in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for rs1344706 were investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging during a ToM task. As hypothesised, risk carriers exhibited a significant (P<0.05 false discovery rate, corrected for multiple comparisons) risk allele dose effect on neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and left temporo-parietal cortex. Moreover, the same effect was found in the left inferior parietal cortex and left inferior frontal cortex, which are part of the human analogue of the mirror neuron system. In addition, in an exploratory analysis (P<0.001 uncorrected), we found evidence for aberrant functional connectivity between the frontal and temporo-parietal regions in risk allele carriers. To conclude, we show that a dysfunction of the ToM network is associated with a genome-wide supported genetic risk variant for schizophrenia and has promise as an intermediate phenotype that can be mined for the development of biological interventions targeted to social dysfunction in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Adaptation and quality of life in anorectal malformation: empirical findings, theoretical concept, Psychometric assessment, and cognitive-behavioral intervention].", "Abstract": "Anorectal malformations are inborn developmental defects that are associated with multiple functional Impairments (especially incontinence) and psychosocial burden with a major impact on body schema and self-esteem.

In addition, 21 experts from pertinent fields presented data to the panel and conference audience.\nPresentations by experts and a systematic review of the literature prepared by the Oregon Evidence-based Practice Center, through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Scientific evidence was given precedence over anecdotal experience.\nThe panel drafted its statement based on scientific evidence presented in open forum and on published scientific literature. The draft statement was presented on the final day of the conference and circulated to the audience for comment. The panel released a revised statement later that day at http://consensus.nih.gov. This statement is an independent report of the panel and is not a policy statement of the NIH or the Federal Government.\nGiven the available evidence, trial of labor is a reasonable option for many pregnant women with one prior low transverse uterine incision. The data reviewed in this report show that both trial of labor and elective repeat cesarean delivery for a pregnant woman with one prior transverse uterine incision have important risks and benefits and that these risks and benefits differ for the woman and her fetus. This poses a profound ethical dilemma for the woman, as well as her caregivers, because benefit for the woman may come at the price of increased risk for the fetus and vice versa. This conundrum is worsened by the general paucity of high-level evidence about both medical and nonmedical factors, which prevents the precise quantification of risks and benefits that might help to make an informed decision about trial of labor compared with elective repeat cesarean delivery. The panel was mindful of these clinical and ethical uncertainties in making the following conclusions and recommendations. One of the panel\u2019s major goals is to support pregnant women with one prior transverse uterine incision to make informed decisions about trial of labor compared with elective repeat cesarean delivery. The panel recommends that clinicians and other maternity care providers use the responses to the six questions, especially questions 3 and 4, to incorporate an evidence-based approach into the decisionmaking process. Information, including risk assessment, should be shared with the woman at a level and pace that she can understand. When trial of labor and elective repeat cesarean delivery are medically equivalent options, a shared decisionmaking process should be adopted and, whenever possible, the woman\u2019s preference should be honored. The panel is concerned about the barriers that women face in gaining access to clinicians and facilities that are able and willing to offer trial of labor. Given the low level of evidence for the requirement for \"immediately available\" surgical and anesthesia personnel in current guidelines, the panel recommends that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society of Anesthesiologists reassess this requirement with specific reference to other obstetric complications of comparable risk, risk stratification, and in light of limited physician and nursing resources. Healthcare organizations, physicians, and other clinicians should consider making public their trial of labor policies and VBAC rates, as well as their plans for responding to obstetric emergencies. The panel recommends that hospitals, maternity care providers, healthcare and professional liability insurers, consumers, and policymakers collaborate on the development of integrated services that could mitigate or even eliminate current barriers to trial of labor. The panel is concerned that medical-legal considerations add to, and in many instances exacerbate, these barriers to trial of labor. Policymakers, providers, and other stakeholders must collaborate in developing and implementing appropriate strategies to mitigate the chilling effect the medical-legal environment has on access to care. High-quality research is needed in many areas. The panel has identified areas that need attention in response to question 6. Research in these areas should be given appropriate priority and should be adequately funded--especially studies that would help to characterize more precisely the short-term and long-term maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of trial of labor and elective repeat cesarean delivery."}, {"Title": "Toward determining the structure of psychiatric visit nonadherence.", "Abstract": "Visit nonadherence, that is, \"no shows,\" in psychiatry costs the US healthcare $100 billion every year.

Detailed questionnaires assessed the subjective and objective impact of the course on residents' knowledge of, and attitudes toward, neuroimaging in psychiatry before and after the course.\nTwenty-five first-year residents completed the questionnaires. Participants were enthusiastic about the content and interested in improving their skills in interpreting clinical neuroimaging studies. By the end of the course, residents also reported large gains in subjective comfort level with neuroimaging literature appraisal and functional neuroanatomy and believed that the course was effective in meeting their own specific learning objectives.

Mental health professionals are increasingly faced with threat assessment in order to help prevent such tragedies. Since the base rate of amok is low and current risk assessment lacks empirical foundations, the likelihood of false-positive results is high. The role of mental health professionals in this domain should be reframed. The focus should not be risk assessment but risk management since most of the mass murderers are in need of some type of psychiatric intervention prior to the massacre.

Logistic regression, which controlled for potential confounds, largely supported these findings.\nFindings suggest that the recruitment of elderly African or Asian Americans into mental health treatment outcome research can be facilitated by a flexible consumer-oriented strategy that integrates multiple recruitment methods. Establishing study credibility through nonmental health media and professional referral sources may be especially effective in engaging the participation of elderly Asian Americans; and cultivating ongoing relationships with key gatekeepers, who can observe benefits to the community, may be particularly effective in recruiting elderly African Americans."}, {"Title": "From sensibility to pathology: the origins of the idea of nervous music around 1800.", "Abstract": "Healing powers have been ascribed to music at least since David's lyre, but a systematic discourse of pathological music emerged only at the end of the eighteenth century. At that time, concerns about the moral threat posed by music were partly replaced by the idea that it could over-stimulate a vulnerable nervous system, leading to illness, immorality, and even death. During the Enlightenment, the relationship between the nerves and music was more often put in terms of refinement and sensibility than pathology. However, around 1800, this view was challenged by a medical critique of modern culture based on a model of the etiology of disease that saw stimulation as the principal cause of sickness. Music's belated incorporation into that critique was made possible by a move away from regarding music as an expression of cosmic and social order toward thinking of it as quasi-electrical stimulation, something that was intensified by the political and cultural changes unleashed by the French Revolution. For the next hundred and fifty years, nervousness caused by musical stimulation was often regarded as a fully fledged Zivilisationskrankheit, widely discussed in psychiatry, music criticism, and literature."}, {"Title": "Shell shock at Maghull and the Maudsley: models of psychological medicine in the UK.", "Abstract": "The shell-shock epidemic of 1915 challenged the capacity and expertise of the British Army's medical services.

The large-scale organization of rs-fMRI networks is robust and reproducible, and rs-fMRI measures show correlations with behavioural phenotypes relevant to psychiatry. However, evidence that such measures are also influenced by preceding psychological states and contexts, as well as individual variations in physiological arousal, may help to explain inconsistent findings in case-control comparisons.\nrs-fMRI measures show both stable and dynamic properties, the nature of which are only beginning to be uncovered. As such, interpreting significant differences between patients and controls on rs-fMRI measures as evidence for alterations in intrinsic functional brain organization should be done cautiously.

These successes, however, have as yet failed to translate into broadly applicable strategies for the improvement of individual drug treatment in psychiatry. One important argument against the widespread adoption of pharmacogenetics as a clinical tool is the lack of evidence showing its impact on medical decision making and on risk benefit ratio for the patients. The individual drug metabolizing capacity is assessed by genotyping drug metabolizing enzymes. The potential implications of information gained from genotyping are dose adjustments according to genotype. However, even when the consequences of genotype on pharmacokinetics are significant and well known, as in the case of many tricyclic antidepressants and several SSRIs, there is still considerable controversy on whether adjustment of dosage driven by genetic information may improve therapeutic efficacy, and/or adverse events is prevented, to an extent of any practical importance in clinical practice. Different types of pharmacogenetic studies may improve our understanding of the functional consequence of a genetic variant in the clinical setting. The use of intermediate phenotypes instead of broad outcome parameters such as drug response or remission might improve our knowledge on what exactly happens if an individual with a specific genotype takes a certain drug.

The study aims to inform decisions about the contribution of GPs to the delivery of undergraduate teaching in psychiatry.\nA questionnaire asked GPs about teaching undergraduate psychiatry in both general and specialist areas.\nThe response rate was 61%. Over a third of GPs felt competent to teach psychiatry to undergraduates in a general practice setting, and the vast majority thought psychiatry should be taught by a combination of GPs and psychiatrists.

We therefore found it relevant to investigate the following in this study: - To register patients with foreign background, who are receiving psychiatric treatment in DPC. - Through a nested case control study to evaluate if/how foreign patients in DPC differ from the remaining patient group.\nThe study was a nested case control study. Relevant clinical information concerning foreign patients was compared to Danish controls.\nA total of 168 patients participated in the study, among these 60 with a foreign background. The study showed that Danish patients more often received early retirement pension, more frequently received 2nd generation antipsychotics, and more frequently received the social support services offered for psychotic patients in the community. Foreign patients more frequently lived with family and children than the Danes. Furthermore, they had a shorter illness duration and had less frequently been admitted to a psychiatric department.\nBased on this study it is emphasised that the efforts to assist foreign patients with psychiatric disorders should be improved. I.e. through inexpensive medicine, specialised teams, better coordination between psychiatrist and the municipality, and improved knowledge of the consequences of psychiatric disorders among the foreign patients."}, {"Title": "French summaries of product characteristics: content in relation to therapeutic monitoring of psychotropic drugs.", "Abstract": "The prescription information (summary of product characteristics, SPC) is compiled by the pharmaceutical industry as required by the national regulatory authorities.

Based on a previous study carried out in Germany, the degree of agreement of French SPC for 59 psychotropic drugs with the existing medico-scientific evidence in the area of TDM was examined using a recently developed instrument. A summary score of SPC content (SPCC) related to TDM (SPCC(TDM)) has been calculated and compared with the level of recommendation of TDM of the AGNP-TDM expert group consensus guidelines for TDM in psychiatry [AGNP: Arbeitsgemeinschaft f\u00fcr Neuropsychopharmakologie und Pharmakopsychiatrie (Association for neuropsychopharmacology and pharmacopsychiatry)]. Among the antidepressants, antipsychotics, tranquillizers/hypnotic agents and mood stabilizers, the highest SPCC(TDM) scores in the French SPC were reached for imipramine (16), haloperidol (6), clonazepam (8) and lithium (23), respectively. Results were similar to those obtained from the analysis of German SPC, and considerable disagreement was found between the information on TDM in SPC and existing medico-scientific evidence, albeit less in the case of mood stabilizers. Taking into account the recommendations of the AGNP-TDM expert group guidelines, there is a deficit in the French SPC concerning TDM-relevant information.

So-called network pharmacology focuses on modifying the behavior of entire systems rather than individual components, a therapeutic strategy that would ideally employ single pharmacological agents capable of interacting with multiple targets (\"magic shotguns\"). For this approach to be successful, however, a framework for understanding pharmacological \"promiscuity\"--the ability of individual agents to modulate multiple molecular targets--is needed.\nPharmacological promiscuity is more often the rule than the exception for drugs that target the central nervous system (CNS). We hypothesize that promiscuity is an important contributor to clinical efficacy. Modulation patterns of existing therapeutic agents may provide critical templates for future drug discovery in Neurology and Psychiatry.\nTo demonstrate the extent of pharmacological promiscuity and develop a framework for guiding drug screening, we reviewed the ability of 170 therapeutic agents and endogenous molecules to directly modulate neurotransmitter receptors, a class of historically attractive therapeutic targets in Neurology and Psychiatry. The results are summarized in the form of 1) receptor-centric maps that illustrate the degree of promiscuity for GABA-, glycine-, serotonin-, and acetylcholine-gated ion channels, and 2) drug-centric maps that illustrated how characterization of promiscuity can guide drug development.\nDeveloping promiscuity maps of approved neuro-pharmaceuticals will provide therapeutic class-based templates against which candidate compounds can be screened. Importantly, compounds previously rejected in traditional screens due to poor specificity could be reconsidered in this framework. Further testing will require high throughput assays to systematically characterize interactions between available CNS-active drugs and surface receptors, both ionotropic and metabotropic."}, {"Title": "[Addiction].", "Abstract": "The 2009 news in medicine regarding dependence confirm the bio-psycho-social field of addiction medicine and psychiatry.

While the terminology related to medical adherence has changed significantly over the past two millennia, the core issue has not. Most recently, the term 'adherence' has replaced the term 'compliance', although it still jostles with 'concordance' in a growing literature which focuses now, as always, on one key question: why do so many people seek treatment for illness but then decide not to take their prescribed medication? This is an important question, both in terms of public health and societal cost: in the US, up to 50% of patients do not take their prescribed medications, resulting in additional healthcare costs of $290 billion per year.

Szasz's arguments have provoked considerable controversy over the past five decades. This paper marks the 50th anniversary of The Myth of Mental Illness by providing commentaries on its contemporary relevance from the perspectives of a range of stakeholders, including a consultant psychiatrist, psychiatric patient, professor of philosophy and mental health, a specialist registrar in psychiatry, and a lecturer in psychiatry. This paper also includes responses by Professor Thomas Szasz. Szasz's arguments contain echoes of positivism, Cartesian dualism, and Enlightenment philosophy, and point to a genuine complexity at the heart of contemporary psychiatric taxonomy: how is 'mental illness' to be defined? And by whom? The basis of Szasz's doubts about the similarities between mental and physical illnesses remain apparent today, but it remains equally apparent that a failure to describe a biological basis for mental illness does not mean there is none (eg. consider the position of epilepsy, prior to the electroencephalogram). Psychiatry would probably be different today if The Myth of Mental Illness had not been written, but possibly not in the ways that Szasz might imagine: does the relentless incarceration of individuals with 'mental illness' in the world's prisons represent the logical culmination of Szaszian thought? In response, Professor Szasz emphasises his views that \"mental illness\" differs fundamentally from physical illness, and that the principal habits the term 'mental illness' involves are stigmatisation, deprivation of liberty (civil commitment) and deprivation of the right to trial for alleged criminal conduct (the insanity defence). He links the incarceration of the mentally ill with the policy of de-institutionalisation (which he opposes) and states that, in his view, the only limitation his work imposes on human activities are limitations on practices which are conventionally and conveniently labelled 'psychiatric abuses'. Clearly, there remains a diversity of views about the merits of Szasz's arguments, but there is little diminution in his ability to provoke an argument."}, {"Title": "Deliberate self-harm (DSH) out of hour's presentations.", "Abstract": "To establish time of presentation to paediatric accident and emergency (A&E) services of children with deliberate self-harm (DSH).\nAll children presenting to an acute paediatric hospital with DSH or suicidal ideation between 1993-2003 were identified and time of presentation collected from their case notes.\nOf the 172 children where the actual time of presentation was recorded, the majority of children - 137 (80%) presented to the hospital outside of the 'normal working hours' of 9am-5pm, Monday - Friday.

Retrospective pharmacokinetic data evaluation.", "Abstract": "Fluoxetine, belonging to the class of selective serotonin uptake inhibitors, has been extensively used for the treatment of depression and other psychiatry related disorders. Fluoxetine (CAS 59333-67-4) is a substrate of polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 isozyme (CYP2D6) leading to the formation of norfluoxetine (CAS 83891-03-06), which is not only active but long lived than the parent in the systemic circulation. Since the parent and metabolite levels are important from a therapeutic perspective, knowledge of phenotypic distribution of the population may be an important consideration.\nThe aim of the work was to retrospectively evaluate the pharmacokinetic data of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine from several bioavailability/bioequivalence (BA/BE) studies to identify the poor metabolizer (PM) phenotypes from the unsuspected healthy subjects across varied protocol designs, dose sizes and differing formulations.\nThe pharmacokinetic data of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were gathered from several BA/BE studies conducted at clinical facilities located at Bangalore and Chennai, India. The BA/BE studies involved open label, two-way randomized crossover designs with two periods and two treatments (reference and test). Blood samples were collected for at least 672 h after fluoxetine dosing and the plasma was analyzed using validated tandem liquid chromatography mass spectrometric assay to determine fluoxetine and norfluoxetine levels. Standard pharmacokinetic parameters were computed using noncompartmental methods. For the purpose of this paper, retrospective evaluation of pharmnacokinetic data from only the reference formulation was considered. The AUC ratio of fluoxetine/norfluoxetine was computed. The individual fluoxetine/norfluoxetine AUC(0-infinity), ratios were plotted in increasing rank order and using outlier test ('T' procedure at 5% level of significance) the subjects were categorized as extensive metabolizer (EM) and PM phenotypes. The unequivocal confirmation of PM phenotypes was obtained by performing linear regression analysis of fluoxetine vs norfluoxetine AUC(0-infinity) values.\nEach study was evaluated for the distribution of EM and PM phenotypes of fluoxetine. There were 144 subjects evaluable from four studies, 89.6% (129 out of 144) of which could be categorised as EMs and 10.4% (15 out of 144) as PMs of fluoxetine. The pharmacokinetic parameters were quite distinct between the two phenotypes: (1) PM phenotypes showed much higher exposure (approximately 2.3-fold increase in AUC(0-infinity) and much slower elimination (almost 2-fold increase in elimination half-life) for fluoxetine as compared to EM phenotypes; (2) PM phenotypes showed approximately 0.5-fold lower exposure of norfluoxetine as compared to the EM counter parts; (3) There was no change (approximately 1.2-fold) in the elimination half life of norfluoxetine in EM and PM phenotypes.\nRetrospective evaluation of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine pharmacokinetic data demonstrated existence of both PM and EM phenotypes in the Indian population. Based on the overall data (n=144 subjects) there appeared to be 10.4% of PM phenotypes for fluoxetine and/or possibly for other polymorphic CYP2D6 substrates commonly used in this region."}, {"Title": "[Nicotine.

The brain target for stimulation was the anterior limb internal capsule (ALIC).\nTo investigate the effect of anterior limb of internal capsule/nucleus accumbens (ALIC-NA) DBS on mild motor and vocal tics in a Tourette syndrome (TS) patient with severe OCD.\nThe optimum target to address symptoms of TS with DBS remains unknown. Earlier lesional therapy utilized thalamic targets and also the ALIC for select cases which had been diagnosed with other psychiatric disorders. Evidence regarding the efficacy of DBS for the symptoms of TS may aid in better defining a brain target's suitability for use. We report efficacy data on ALIC-NA DBS in a patient with severe OCD and mild TS.\nA 33-year-old man underwent bilateral ALIC-NA DBS. One month following implantation, a post-operative CT scan was obtained to verify lead locations. Yale Global Tic Severity Scales (YGTSS) and modified Rush Videotape Rating scales (MRVRS) were obtained throughout the first 6 months, as well as careful clinical examinations by a specialized neurology and psychiatry team. The patient has been followed for 30 months.\nYGTSS scores worsened by 17% during the first 6 months. MRVRS scores also worsened over 30 total months of follow-up. There was a lack of clinically significant tic reduction although subjectively the patient felt tics improved mildly.\nDBS in the ALIC-NA failed to effectively address mild vocal and motor tics in a patient with TS and severe comorbid OCD."}, {"Title": "Genetic repositories for the study of major psychiatric conditions: what do we know about ethnic minorities' genetic vulnerability?", "Abstract": "In spite of considerable efforts, no genes of major effect have been found across an entire diagnostic category in psychiatry. Possible reasons for this may include difficulties in defining the phenotype, the complex relationship between genotype and gene expression and population stratification. This last problem has often been managed by restricting genetic sampling to only one ethnic group. An unintended consequence of using this strategy is that the major repositories of genetic material for the study of psychiatric conditions in the United States suffer from a paucity of genetic samples from non-Caucasian groups. Thus, these groups are being relatively understudied in terms of the genetic antecedents to psychiatric disease. The authors provide solutions including the need to augment the representation of African-American, Latino and Asian-Americans among research participants; a more nuanced approach to identify ancestry; and the development of analytic and genetic strategies to handle the issue of ethnic heterogeneity in samples."}, {"Title": "[Taking care of teenagers hospitalized after a suicidal gesture or a suicidal threat].", "Abstract": "Teenagers' suicidal gestures are a major problem of public health and it is important to understand its meaning. A global taking care of teenagers hospitalized after a suicide attempt or a suicidal threat by the pediatric teams and by the team of child psychiatry, having links with each department, is essential in the Necker - Enfants Malades hospital in Paris. The protocole of care has been recently strengthened by the integration of a deep psychological checkup with the projective tests Rorschach and Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) during the hospitalization, a psychological follow-up from a distance of the suicidal gesture and a second psychological checkup one year later in order to observe the evolution of the psychic functioning. The projective tests offer a special way to express the own intimate problematic while respecting the subject's need to remain hidden. These tests, analyzed with a psychodynamic interpretation, help the clinician to precise the psychic diagnosis, which is very important for the future therapeutic orientation, and offer to the patient a medium to express the hidden meaning of his gesture. To consider suicidal gesture not only as a dead end of identificatory process but also as an attempt to start up again this process may favor a therapeutic mobilization of psychic resources. Self-attack may signify a struggle against melancholy, the prospect of death appearing less frightening than those of madness. Suicidal gesture may express a transitory developmental breakdown but identificatory process may be revived if the suffering of the teenager may be listened, contented, elaborated and linked to meaning."}, {"Title": "Prospective quality-of-life monitoring of simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplant recipients using the 36-item short form health survey.", "Abstract": "Few risk factors for quality-of-life outcomes of simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplant recipients are known because of a paucity of data from prospective studies.\nPretransplant assessment and prospective 3-year follow-up.\nConsecutive potential recipients at a university teaching hospital assessed by Liaison Psychiatry.\nDemographic data; pretransplant Transplant Evaluation Rating Scale scores; current, past 12 months, and prior lifetime psychiatric disorder.\n36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores.\n37 simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplant recipients were assessed pretransplant and at 4 months posttransplant.

Psychiatry treats cross-sex identities as a disorder, but key medical organizations and the law in some jurisdictions have taken steps to protect people with these identities from discrimination in health care, housing, and employment. In fact, many people with cross-sex identities bypass psychiatric treatment altogether in order to pursue lives that are meaningful to them, lives that sometimes include children. Cross-sex identification does not render people unfit as parents, because transgender identities do not undercut the ability to understand the nature and consequences of pregnancy or necessarily interfere with the ability to raise children. Moreover, no evidence suggests that being born to and raised by transgender parents triggers the kind of harm that would justify exclusion of trans-identified men and women from ARTs as a class. The normalization of transgender identities by the law and professional organizations contributes, moreover, to the need to reassess pathological interpretations of cross-sex identities, and trans-parenthood puts those interpretations into sharp relief."}, {"Title": "Recovery in parents of children and adolescents who survived septic shock caused by Neisseria meningitidis: a cross-sectional study.", "Abstract": "To assess psychological distress, styles of coping and disease-related psychosocial limitations in parents of children and adolescents who survived meningococcal septic shock (MSS) 4-16 years ago.\nAn exploratory design using standardised questionnaires and interviews.\nThe psychological investigation took place in the department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of the ErasmusMC-Sophia Children's Hospital.\n87 mothers and 77 fathers participated in this study.

Moreover, diagnosis criteria only exist for adult psychiatry, and there are no therapeutic guidelines. The aim of this paper is to describe the case of a 14-year-old girl presenting an overlap between psychogenic and neuroleptic induced catatonia, acute treatment and ten year's follow-up.\nA 14-year-old Caucasian French girl, Elsa, was admitted in February 1998 to a University adolescent mental health center with an acute psychotic disorder. She showed agitation, impulsivity (sudden engagement in inappropriate behaviour), paranoid delusions, visual and auditory hallucinations, diurnal and nocturnal urinary incontinence, lack of self-care, inadequate food intake because of fear of poisoning, and vomiting after meals leading to rapid weight loss of 5 kg. Clinical examination, laboratory tests, EEG and RMI were normal. Toxicological tests were negative. Her IQ, assessed six months before admission, was in the dull average range (70-75). Elsa was treated with loxapine 150 mg per day for one week without improvement and this was then replaced by haloperidol 30 mg per day. One week after the start of haloperidol her agitation, impulsivity, and hallucinatory symptoms decreased. Twenty four days after loxapine introduction and 17 days after the haloperidol, her condition deteriorated rapidly over less than 48 hours. She exhibited immobility, minimal response to stimuli, staring and catalepsy with waxy flexibility. The diagnosis of catatonia was established. Examination revealed tremulous extremities, tachychardia (110 pm) and apyrexia. Creatine phosphokinase levels were 106 UI/l (normal range 0-250). Human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, listeria and Lyme serology were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Haloperidol was stopped and intravenous clonazepam 5mg/kg was begun. It was not possible to obtain signed consent from the two parents for Electroconvulsive therapy. The patient was transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit. The treatment was standard parenteral nutrition, nursing, intravenous clonazepam 0.05 mg/kg, with regular attendance by a child psychiatrist. Elsa stayed three weeks in this condition. She then began to notice the child psychiatrist, and a few days later she was able to carry out simple requests. Elsa was transferred to an adolescent psychiatric unit. As soon as she could eat by herself again, carbamazepine 400mg per day was begun. Her agitation reduced at a carbamazepine level of 7 mg/l. One month later her condition was stable. However, language difficulties persisted for a further six months. One year after the episode she scored 66 on a repeat IQ test and her RMI was normal. She exhibited no significant residual symptoms except some cognitive impairment. She integrated into a special education facility. These attempts to stop the carbamazepine were followed by depressed mood, aggressiveness and impulsivity; carbamazepine was finally stopped successfully after seven years. Ten years later, Elsa is the mother of two young children and is able to take care of them. She has never had a relapse of her psychotic disorder or catatonic state.\nThe etiopathogenic diagnosis is problematic. Some indices in the familial history may suggest a traumatic event. But one to the total residual amnesia it was never confirmed, and traumatic catatonia are extremely rare. Normal CPK levels, with autonomic disturbance limited to tachycardia and the lack of resolution after discontinuance of medication, argues against a diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). But CPK levels are non specific, and NMS without pyrexia has been described. The occurrence of the catatonic syndrome 21 days after the first dose of a neuroleptic could be diagnostic. This case involved a non organic catatonic psychosis followed by neuroleptic induced catatonia. Catatonia is described as a risk factor for the development of NMS and some consider NMS to be a variant of malignant catatonia. The interest of this report is (1) it reinforces the need to be cautious before prescribing neuroleptics in adolescents presenting with symptoms of catatonia; (2) the complete recovery from catatonia after treatment with intensive care and more than three weeks of intravenous clonazepam without the use of ECT and (3) the effectiveness of carbamazepine over a long period of follow-up. Although trials on carbamazepine in catatonia are published, there are no data available for the control of residual symptoms or the long term prognosis, especially in child and adolescent psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Kleine-Levin syndrome: a case report].", "Abstract": "The purpose of this article is to report an original clinical case whose symptoms suggest a very peculiar pathology, because of its rarity, symptomatic expression and unclear etiopathogenesis: the Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS). During the regression of tonsillitis concomitant with an emotional shock, the 15-year-old patient exhibited a dramatic change in behaviour, at odds with his previous state, and accompanied by hypersomnia and confusion, megaphagia, irritability, hypersexuality and mood disorders. We observed a spontaneous and total regression of the symptoms after 12 days, except for the incomplete amnesia that proved to be persistent. Four months later, further to an ethylic drunkenness, the patient presented with a new and similar episode. The patient benefited from no medicinal treatment, even in the course of hypersomnia episodes and asymptomatic periods. After a clinical presentation of this patient, we will consider this case study from a more psychopathological angle by questioning the existence of a facilitating psychological profile. The discovery of an IQ equal to 86 from the scores of WISC-IV, and the identification of constructive visual difficulties made us suspect neurological disorders, but these abnormalities were not found during the completion of the Rey Complex Figure Test. The personality profile issued from the scores at the MMPI-A assessment was ranked as barely significant (type 2-4): indeed, it showed nothing specific to this patient. Literature data show that most of the patients presenting with a KLS have been seen by a psychiatrist at the time of the disease and diagnosed as suffering from hysteria, or schizophrenia, or bipolar disorders... Because of diagnostic wanderings, some patients have, hence, received inappropriate treatments. One should pay close attention to this very rare syndrome, on the border between neurology and psychiatry, since its diagnosis is essentially based on clinical features, and carefully think about the implementation of a medicinal treatment. This unique case seems unable to support our working hypothesis about the identification of a particular psychological profile in the KLS, but the question of an underlying fragility is still worth considering. We personally think that, even though links between the KLS and bipolar disorders have been suggested, this disease has to be considered as a separate entity."}, {"Title": "The Six Item Cognitive Impairment Test (6-CIT) as a screening test for dementia: comparison with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).", "Abstract": "The UK national Dementia Strategy clearly outlines a case for early detection and diagnosis of dementia.

The study included 77 patients with schizophrenia whose symptoms were not optimally controlled and/or who did not tolerate their current antipsychotic medications well. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three different strategies for switching to aripiprazole 10 mg, i.e.: (i) simultaneous discontinuation of the current antipsychotic; (ii) tapering off the current antipsychotic over 4 weeks with half the dose after the first 2 weeks; or (iii) tapering off the current antipsychotic over 4 weeks after maintenance of the current dose for 2 weeks. The main outcome measure was the difference in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores from baseline to weeks 1, 2 and 4.\nBaseline severity of disease, as measured by the Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale, BPRS and Schedule for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, significantly predicted worsening at weeks 1, 2 and 4. Specifically, lesser disease severity at baseline significantly predicted worsening after switching to aripiprazole.\nPatients with relatively mild illness severity might be more susceptible to early worsening of symptoms when switched to aripiprazole. However, the limitations of the present study, including a small sample size, absence of a control group designed to control for nonspecific factors such as regression to the mean, and implementation of a switching strategy that included only aripiprazole, mean the present findings should be considered with caution and further research is needed."}, {"Title": "Introduction to the special issue, pathways between genes, brain, and behavior.", "Abstract": "In the past 10 years or so, with the sequencing of the human genome and rapid advances in the development of high throughput techniques, the field of behavior genetics has increasingly moved toward the detection of actual genes and environmental factors.

The 15 articles in this special issue were selected to represent the diversity of methodologies applied to the complexity of pathways linking genes, brain, and behavior. While providing strong evidence for the role of genes in individual differences in brain structure and function, these papers also demonstrate that environmental experiences alter neurobiological pathways, and that genetic factors may further moderate the impact of environmental experience.

There are several problems such as stress overload or burnout due to the difficulty in responding to all demands from patients and the shortness of time. These problems sometimes make doctors specializing in palliative care have less interest in patients, negative feelings or an indifferent attitude to them. In this report, two cases in which a psychosomatic medical doctor intervened were analyzed. The satisfaction of patients and the stress overload of doctors engaged in palliative care were examined retrospectively by investigation of patients' charts. Both factors were improved by such interventions, thus underscoring the possible contributions by these doctors in cancer medicine. Psychosomatic medicine is based on a biopsychosocial model and related to both physical and psychosocial factors. There are many similar viewpoints between psychosomatic medicine and palliative care medicine. Psychosomatic medical doctors have an advantage in that they can contribute to palliative care without stress overload or burnout because of their special training in communication skills to deal with patients from the standpoints of both mind and body. However, these doctors have not received psychiatric training so as to be able to diagnose precisely and treat psychiatric problems such as adjustment disorders, depression and delirium. Therefore, their further training in psychiatry for several months or years is an issue to be addressed in future."}, {"Title": "Perpetrators of homicide with schizophrenia: sociodemographic characteristics and clinical factors in the eastern region of Turkey.", "Abstract": "In this study, we aimed to describe the social and clinical characteristics and offense details in a sample of people with schizophrenia convicted of homicide in the eastern region of Turkey. This study was performed in Elazig Mental Hospital between November 2004 and May 2007. We included 43 men and 6 women with schizophrenia convicted of homicide who were hospitalized in the forensic psychiatry unit for compulsory treatment. Preset data recording forms were used. The first part of the forms contained questions regarding the age, sex, marital status, residence, educational status, and occupation of the patients. The second part of the forms included questions about some clinical features of patients with schizophrenia: the presence of schizophrenia in any family member, duration of the disease, subtype of schizophrenia, previous contact with mental health services, types of antipsychotics (first and last drug used), and adherence to antipsychotic medication. The third part of the forms dealt with alcohol-substance abuse and features of the victim (sex of the victim and whether the victim was a stranger, partner, or an ex-partner in the family or an acquaintance). The mean +/- SD age of our patients was 36.98 +/- 10.07 years, and 55.1% of the patients were unmarried. In our sample, 42.9% of the patients were primary school graduates and 75.5% were unemployed. Of the perpetrators, 14.3% never had contact with mental health services. However, 85.7% of patients had previous contact with mental health services. We found that 85.7% of the patients were paranoid subtype and 85.7% were not using their medication regularly and that treatment compliance was considerably low.

Observations on internal and external challenges to the profession.", "Abstract": "Based on recently voiced concerns about a crisis in psychiatry, six challenges to our profession are identified and discussed. As we approach the revisions of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, the validity of psychiatry's diagnostic definitions and classification systems is increasingly questioned also from inside psychiatry. In addition, confidence in the results of therapeutic intervention studies is waning. A further challenge is the existence of de facto subgroups with opposing ideologies, a situation which is responsible for an unclear role profile of the psychiatrist. Challenges from outside include mounting patient and carer criticism, intrusion of other professions into psychiatry's traditional field of competence, and psychiatry's low status within medicine and in society in general. Studies suggest that the decline of the recruitment into psychiatry, as it is observed in many countries, might be related to problems arising from these challenges. It is unclear whether psychiatry will survive as a unitary medical discipline or whether those segments which are more rewarding, both financially and in status, will break away, leaving the unattractive tasks to carry out by what remains of psychiatry. The demise of the generalist and the rise of the specialist in modern society may contribute to this development.

The mechanism that causes the progressive escalation of symptoms with the passage of time leading to delayed onset post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) involves the process of sensitization and kindling. The development of traumatic memories at the time of stress exposure represents a major vulnerability through repeated environmental triggering of the increasing dysregulation of an individual's neurobiology. An increasing body of evidence demonstrates how the increased allostatic load associated with PTSD is associated with a significant body of physical morbidity in the form of chronic musculoskeletal pain, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, obesity and cardiovascular disease. This increasing body of literature suggests that the effects of traumatic stress need to be considered as a major environmental challenge that places individual's physical and psychological health equally at risk. This broader perspective has important implications for developing treatments that address the underlying dysregulation of cortical arousal and neurohormonal abnormalities following exposure to traumatic stress."}, {"Title": "[Mental health beliefs between culture and subjective illness experience].", "Abstract": "Subjective health beliefs are representations about pathogenesis, course and treatment options of psychic as well as somatic illnesses.

This paper, part two of a two-part series, investigates the historical, social and cultural aspects of the interaction of syphilis and psychiatry.\nBy the end of the 19th century, social changes such as population growth, mass migration from Eastern Europe and technological developments led to a great rise in syphilis. By 1900, it was estimated that 5-20% of the population of Europe and the USA had, or would have, syphilis. By 1914, there were over 100,00 new cases and 3 million cases of syphilis in Great Britain. There was a constant interaction between syphilis, prostitution and sexual crime; it was the likely motivation for the Jack the Ripper murders, if not many in the next century. The idea of hereditary syphilis fitted perfectly into the theory of degeneration and coursed through psychiatry and caught the attention of Adolf Hitler, facilitating his antisemitic paranoia. Psychiatric progress passed to the German school, led by Kraepelin who did his first research into the symptoms and course of neurosyphilis. In 1906, Wasserman's serological test for syphilis showed that latent lesions could be present. Any doubt about the cause of syphilis was finally eliminated when Noguchi and Moore demonstrated the presence of treponema pallidum in paretic brains in 1913. German academic psychiatry defined psychiatric practice for the next century but malariotherapy, the first physical treatment in psychiatry, was announced by Julius Wagner-Juarreg in Vienna in 1917, bringing hope to the incurable and destroying the climate of therapeutic nihilism that haunted psychiatry. The first trial of malariotherapy in Australia was done by Reginald Ellery at Mont Park Hospital In 1927 in Melbourne. The discovery of penicillin was a caesura, ending malariotherapy and leading many to regard syphilis as a night-extinct illness, but this turned out to be an illusion.

At the time, the Pinel School was focussing on the environment and moral therapy. Bayle, who made the first discovery of the cause of a psychiatric disease - chronic arachnoiditis - paid the price for his discovery by being driven from psychiatry.

The field was dominated by Frenchmen, Philippe Ricord and Alfred Fournier, and Englishman Jonathan Hutchinson. A middle-class illness, neurosyphilis struck at the heart of the class interests - property. This reeked havoc with the family business or finances, causing considerable distress to their relatives.

Theoretical conflicts are treated here as those that arise among practitioners holding divergent theoretical orientations towards the phenomena being treated. Such conflicts, although steeped in history, have become revitalized by recent attempts at integrating mental health services that have forced diversely trained practitioners to work collaboratively together, often under one roof. Part I of this paper examines how the history of these conflicts can be understood as a tension between, on the one hand, the medical model and its use by the dominant profession of psychiatry, and on the other, those alternative models and practitioners in some way differentiated from the medical model camp. Examples will be given from recent policy and research to highlight the prevalence of this tension in contemporary practice. Part II of this paper explores the deeper commonalities that lay beneath the theoretical conflict outlined in Part I. These commonalities will be shown to be apart of a captivating framework that has continued to grip the conflict since its inception. By exposing this underlying framework--and the motivations inherent therein--the topic of integration appears in wholly different light, allowing a renewed philosophical basis for integration to emerge."}, {"Title": "Attitudes of early-career psychiatrists in Japan toward child and adolescent psychiatry and their career decision.", "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to carry out a national survey to understand the attitude of early-career psychiatrists toward child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP). The subjects were 348 early-career psychiatrists. A questionnaire was sent to the subjects and returned anonymously. A total of 234 subjects (67.2%) responded. Ten out of 115 psychiatrists (8.9%) in their first-third year of experience, and 18 of 119 psychiatrists (15.1%) in their fourth-10th year answered that they had interest in CAP.

After standardization of the method, the retention times of 700 compounds were determined and transitions for each compound were selected by a \"scheduled\" survey MRM scan, followed by an information-dependent acquisition using the sensitive enhanced product ion scan of a Q TRAP hybrid instrument. The identification of the compounds in the samples analyzed was accomplished by searching the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra against the library we developed, which contains electrospray ionization-MS/MS spectra of over 1,250 compounds. The multi-target screening method together with the library was included in a software program for routine screening and quantitation to achieve automated acquisition and library searching. With the help of this software application, the time for evaluation and interpretation of the results could be drastically reduced. This new multi-target screening method has been successfully applied for the analysis of postmortem and traffic offense samples as well as proficiency testing, and complements screening with immunoassays, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and liquid chromatography-diode-array detection. Other possible applications are analysis in clinical toxicology (for intoxication cases), in psychiatry (antidepressants and other psychoactive drugs), and in forensic toxicology (drugs and driving, workplace drug testing, oral fluid analysis, drug-facilitated sexual assault)."}, {"Title": "The impact of sleep-related attentional bias on polysomnographically measured sleep in primary insomnia.", "Abstract": "Although sleep-related attentional bias has been shown to be evident in primary insomnia, the association with objectively measured sleep has not been investigated. In the present study, we used polysomnography (PSG) to fill this void.\nPatients with primary insomnia and healthy controls were studied using a visual dot probe task (VDP) and an emotional Stroop task (EST). Additionally, polysomnography was carried out in a sub-sample (n = 22) of patients in the subsequent night.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the University of Freiburg Medical Center.\nThirty patients with primary insomnia and 30 matched healthy controls.\nN/A.\nPatients with primary insomnia demonstrated a significant sleep-related attentional bias compared to controls in the EST but no significant group effects were found for the VDP. VDP attentional bias scores were positively correlated with measures of sleep pressure, including total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and the amount of slow wave sleep. EST attentional bias scores were not correlated with subsequent PSG parameters, and we did not observe a correlation between attentional bias scores on the two tasks.\nThe unexpected relationship between increased attentional bias, in the VDP task, and improved markers of sleep duration and continuity, may be indicative of a homeostatic craving for sleep in those with high attentional bias. This awaits further testing in multiple night studies, to shed light on the mechanisms and implications of sleep-related attentional bias."}, {"Title": "[Day hospital treatment in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Day hospitals provide an organizational framework for complex psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatments. They have been developed regarding treatment and in number, perhaps surprisingly, to fit existing standards in almost all domains of psychiatry. Similarities exist in the emphasis on acute treatment, in the orientation towards social inclusion, and particularly in the ability to connect with previous treatment settings. Day treatment guidelines exist only in basic form. In general the complex outpatient treatment is led by psychiatrists; the treatment is planned and pre-defined regarding time and goal orientation. It is directed exclusively at patients with severe mental health disorders and practiced by a multi-professional team. A structured treatment milieu is likely to be the main ingredient which includes all somatic-biological and many psychotherapeutic methods. Special options that for the most part have been empirically validated are available for the treatment of post-acute patients, prevention of social exclusion from families and work, detoxification of addicts and psychotherapy of personality disorders. The rapid increase of facilities is expected to persist for some time. Scientific evidence is relatively strong. Given proper indication, financial resources are used with a high degree of efficiency."}, {"Title": "The Kraepelinian dichotomy - going, going... but still not gone.", "Abstract": "Recent genetic studies reinforce the view that current approaches to the diagnosis and classification of major psychiatric illness are inadequate. These findings challenge the distinction between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and suggest that more attention should be given to the relationship between the functional psychoses and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. We are entering a transitional period of several years during which psychiatry will need to move from using traditional descriptive diagnoses to clinical entities (categories and/or dimensions) that relate more closely to the underlying workings of the brain."}, {"Title": "Attitudes of Flemish physiotherapy students towards mental health and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In general, psychiatry is not very popular among healthcare providers, although no information is available concerning the attitudes of physiotherapy students towards mental heath. This study examined the attitudes of physiotherapy students towards psychiatry considering the subject's gender, previous experience with psychiatry and the impact of a specific course.\nThis experimental study compared the attitudes of physiotherapy students (n=219) with those of students without a biomedical background (n=112) towards psychiatry. All students were between 17 and 28 years of age, and completed an established international questionnaire entitled 'Attitudes Towards Psychiatry'. Within the group of physiotherapy students, the effect of a 65-hour course on psychiatric rehabilitation on their attitudes was evaluated.\nAttitudes towards psychiatry were moderately positive [mean (SD) 103.3 (9.9)]. There was a small but significant difference between physiotherapy students and non-medical students (Cohen's d=0.31). Female students had a more positive attitude towards psychiatry than their male peers (Cohen's d=0.44). Prior experience with mental illness was associated with more positive attitudes (Cohen's d=0.68). Attitudes increased in positivity after completion of a psychiatry course (Cohen's d=0.72).\nTo ensure basic physiotherapeutic treatment for the mentally ill, physiotherapy education should aim to promote positive attitudes towards mental illness as well as psychiatry. High-quality courses and personal interaction with patients are the best strategies to achieve this goal."}, {"Title": "Regional and individual influences on use of mental health services in Canada.", "Abstract": "Knowledge is lacking on the extent to which area-level characteristics contribute to variations observed in the use of mental health services. This study examined the influence of area- and individual-level characteristics on the use of mental health services.\nData from a nationally representative, population-based, cross-sectional survey, the Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health and Well-Being, consisting of adults aged 15 years or older (n = 36 984), were linked to Canadian 2001 Census profiles according to health region boundaries (n = 97). Multilevel multivariable logistic regression modelling was used to: estimate variation in 12-month self-reported use of health services for mental health reasons between health regions; and, estimate the effects of individual- and area-level need, health resources, and sociodemographic factors on self-reported 12-month use of medical services for mental health reasons.\nThere was a 2.1% and 3.5% regional variation for general practitioner-family physician (GP-FP) and psychiatric health service use during 12 months, respectively. Most of the regional variation observed was explained by number of physicians per health region and regional and individual need factors. Adults who were middle-aged, had a post-secondary education, low-income, were separated, widowed, or divorced, and Canadian-born were significantly more likely to use GP-FP and psychiatry services for mental health reasons at the individual level, even after adjusting for area- and individual-level need factors.\nMost area-level variation was explained by the availability of health region resources and individual-level need factors. After accounting for need, numerous sociodemographic factors retained their association with use of mental health services. Additional efforts are needed at the area and individual level to reduce inequities through appropriate targeted care."}, {"Title": "Management of antipsychotic and mood stabilizer medication in pregnancy: recommendations for antenatal care.", "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to develop recommendations for antenatal care and monitoring for women with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia who are on lithium carbonate, antipsychotic or anti-epileptic medication during pregnancy. A literature search and review of original research, published reviews and guidelines was undertaken for mood stabilizers and antipsychotics in pregnancy and for the management of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in pregnancy. This information was summarized, condensed and then reviewed by representatives of psychiatry, pharmacy, paediatrics and obstetrics to produce an information booklet and subsequently monitoring recommendations and tables. A model of antenatal monitoring and care for women with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and related disorders who are maintained on psychotropic medication was developed. This included an online and published booklet for clinicians summarizing psychotropic medication in pregnancy, and lactation and monitoring tables that could be part of patient case files. These were to assist in reminding and educating staff on the need for additional monitoring and assessment above standard antenatal care for women on mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medication. Women with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have an increased risk of complications in pregnancy from their illness and from the medications they are prescribed. A summary of the risks and a model of suggested additional monitoring during pregnancy have been developed in consultation across a number of clinical disciplines."}, {"Title": "Brief report: Predicting inner speech use amongst children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD): the roles of verbal ability and cognitive profile.", "Abstract": "Studies of inner speech use in ASD have produced conflicting results. Lidstone et al., J Autism Dev Disord (2009) hypothesised that Cognitive Profile (i.e., discrepancy between non-verbal and verbal abilities) is a predictor of inner speech use amongst children with ASD. They suggested other, contradictory results might be explained in terms of the different composition of ASD samples (in terms of Cognitive Profile) in each study. To test this, we conducted a new analysis of Williams et al.'s, J Child Psychol Psychiatry 48(1): 51-58 (2008) data on inner speech use in ASD. This revealed verbal ability predicted inner speech use on a short-term memory task over and above Cognitive Profile, but not vice versa. This suggests multiple factors determine whether children with ASD employ verbal mediation."}, {"Title": "On the ontological assumptions of the medical model of psychiatry: philosophical considerations and pragmatic tasks.", "Abstract": "A common theme in the contemporary medical model of psychiatry is that pathophysiological processes are centrally involved in the explanation, evaluation, and treatment of mental illnesses. Implied in this perspective is that clinical descriptors of these pathophysiological processes are sufficient to distinguish underlying etiologies. Psychiatric classification requires differentiation between what counts as normality (i.e.- order), and what counts as abnormality (i.e.- disorder). The distinction(s) between normality and pathology entail assumptions that are often deeply presupposed, manifesting themselves in statements about what mental disorders are.In this paper, we explicate that realism, naturalism, reductionism, and essentialism are core ontological assumptions of the medical model of psychiatry. We argue that while naturalism, realism, and reductionism can be reconciled with advances in contemporary neuroscience, essentialism - as defined to date - may be conceptually problematic, and we pose an eidetic construct of bio-psychosocial order and disorder based upon complex systems' dynamics. However we also caution against the overuse of any theory, and claim that practical distinctions are important to the establishment of clinical thresholds. We opine that as we move ahead toward both a new edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, and a proposed Decade of the Mind, the task at hand is to re-visit nosologic and ontologic assumptions pursuant to a re-formulation of diagnostic criteria and practice."}, {"Title": "Prison health-care wings: psychiatry's forgotten frontier?", "Abstract": "There is worldwide evidence of high rates of mental disorder among prisoners, with significant co-morbidity. In England and Wales, mental health services have been introduced from the National Health Service to meet the need, but prison health-care wings have hardly been evaluated.\nTo conduct a service evaluation of the health-care wing of a busy London remand (pre-trial) prison and examine the prevalence and range of mental health problems, including previously unrecognised psychosis.\nService-use data were collected from prison medical records over a 20-week period in 2006-2007, and basic descriptive statistics were generated.\nEighty-eight prisoners were admitted (4.4 per week). Most suffered from psychosis, a third of whom were not previously known to services. Eleven men were so ill that they required emergency compulsory treatment in the prison under Common Law before hospital transfer could take place. Over a quarter of the men required hospital transfer. Problem behaviours while on the prison health-care wing were common.\nPrison health-care wings operate front-line mental illness triaging and recognition functions and also provide care for complex individuals who display behavioural disturbance. Services are not equivalent to those in hospitals, nor the community, but instead reflect the needs of the prison in which they are situated. There is a recognised failure to divert at earlier points in the criminal justice pathway, which may be a consequence of national failure to fund services properly. Hospital treatment is often delayed."}, {"Title": "Antidepressant medication and executive dysfunction: a deleterious interaction in late-life depression.", "Abstract": "To determine whether there is differential response to placebo or citalopram among older patients with and without deficient response inhibition (DRI).\nThis is an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\nOutpatient psychiatry.\nUnipolar depressed patients aged 75 years and older.\nCitalopram (20-40 mg/day) or placebo pill.\nBaseline Stroop Color-Word Test and weekly 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression assessments.\nCitalopram-treated patients with DRI did significantly worse than placebo-treated patients with DRI.

While 82% had a public appointment, 34% worked in private practice where barriers included the lack of a multidisciplinary team and remuneration. Only 18% of clinical time was in a rural or regional setting. High levels of job satisfaction (88%) were found, with the main factors being working with older people, working in a multidisciplinary team and the intellectual challenge. Advanced training was felt to be beneficial, though some weaknesses were identified.\nOld age psychiatry is a satisfying career with an advanced training program that is reported to be beneficial to practice.

The empirical data supporting their use are limited, and there is only anecdotal evidence indicating effectiveness in psychiatric populations. The specific aims of this observational pilot study were to determine whether multisensory-based therapies were effective in managing psychiatric symptoms and to evaluate how these interventions compared to traditional ones used in the milieu. The study found that multisensory interventions were as effective as traditional ones in managing symptoms, and participants' Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores significantly improved following both kinds of intervention. Medication administration did not affect symptom reduction. This article explores how multisensory interventions offer choice in symptom management. Education regarding multisensory strategies should become integral to inpatient and outpatient group programs, in that additional symptom management strategies can only be an asset."}, {"Title": "Patient safety--what claims against the NHS can teach us.", "Abstract": "The study, first published in 2004, looks at databases on clinical negligence litigation, what kind of claims for clinical negligence there have been, and studies cases in different settings such as general practice, general surgery and medicine, psychiatry and obstetrics."}, {"Title": "Discrimination against international medical graduates in the United States residency program selection process.", "Abstract": "Available evidence suggests that international medical graduates have improved the availability of U.S. health care while maintaining academic standards. We wondered whether studies had been conducted to address how international graduates were treated in the post-graduate selection process compared to U.S. graduates.\nWe conducted a Medline search for research on the selection process.\nTwo studies provide strong evidence that psychiatry and family practice programs respond to identical requests for applications at least 80% more often for U.S. medical graduates than for international graduates. In a third study, a survey of surgical program directors, over 70% perceived that there was discrimination against international graduates in the selection process.\nThere is sufficient evidence to support action against discrimination in the selection process. Medical organizations should publish explicit proscriptions of discrimination against international medical graduates (as the American Psychiatric Association has done) and promote them in diversity statements. They should develop uniform and transparent policies for program directors to use to select applicants that minimize the possibility of non-academic discrimination, and the accreditation organization should monitor whether it is occurring. Whether there should be protectionism for U.S. graduates or whether post-graduate medical education should be an unfettered meritocracy needs to be openly discussed by medicine and society."}, {"Title": "Low-dose divalproex in agitated patients with Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "Adequate treatment of behavioral disturbances in Alzheimer's disease is both important and difficult. This report describes a case series that examined the effectiveness and safety of low-dose divalproex in the treatment of agitated patients with Alzheimer's disease who were admitted to an inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit over a 1-year period. All patients had agitation due to probable Alzheimer's disease or mixed dementia and were prescribed divalproex monotherapy at low and completely flexible doses. Patients and nursing staff were blind to study enrollment. Clinical global impression scale scores, divalproex serum levels, and a variety of medical chart data were collected. Twenty patients met selection criteria and were included in the study. Of those, 13 patients (65%) were considered responders, while 4 patients (20%) required augmentation with other psychotropic medications; divalproex was discontinued in 1 patient. Adverse events occurred in 25% of patients. This case series suggests that low-dose divalproex may offer behavioral improvement and a reduced risk of side effects for some patients with agitation in Alzheimer's disease."}, {"Title": "Clinical outcomes and low-dose levocarnitine supplementation in psychiatric inpatients with documented hypocarnitinemia: a retrospective chart review.", "Abstract": "Metabolic encephalopathy is one of the crucial manifestations of carnitine deficiency. In psychiatric patients, low serum carnitine levels may result from chronic valproate therapy. Despite the widespread use of valproate in psychiatry, neither carnitine deficiency nor supplementation has been studied in a psychiatric population.\nTo describe clinical outcomes in hospitalized psychiatric patients with documented hypocarnitinemia who were receiving oral levocarnitine supplementation.\nRetrospective chart review.\nIn 38 patients with hypocarnitinemia, a low-dose oral levocarnitine supplementation, in association with comprehensive psychiatric therapy, did not result in any adverse psychiatric or medical outcomes, and was associated with overall improved behavioral, cognitive, and motor functioning. Initially all patients had some degree of cognitive impairment, but after correction of carnitine serum levels, scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) improved in most of the patients (mean improvement 5.5 points, P <0.0001), and normalized in 11 cases. This allowed a correction of the diagnosis in 8 of 14 patients who had initially been diagnosed with dementia. African-American patients achieved significantly lower serum carnitine levels and MMSE scores than Caucasian patients with comparable therapy.\nWe hypothesize that correction of carnitine depletion, either by levocarnitine supplementation or by valproate dose reduction, may enhance recovery from hypocarnitinemia-associated encephalopathy in psychiatric patients. Our findings also suggest that ethnic traits may affect carnitine bioavailability as well as cognitive outcomes in this clinical context. Further studies of carnitine metabolism and supplementation in psychiatric patients are warranted."}, {"Title": "Child psychiatry in the Finnish health care reform: national criteria for treatment access.", "Abstract": "As a part of the Finnish National Health Care Project, to develop and validate nationwide standardised criteria for assessing the need for non-urgent child psychiatric specialised medical care (SMC).\nThe Finnish criteria tool, a cutpoint measure indicating access to SMC, was developed on the basis of the Western Canada Waiting List Criteria Tool.

This study aimed to survey GPs' knowledge, attitude, and their views of their role in the screening, diagnosing and managing children with ADHD.\nSix hundred and sixty five general physicians in Shiraz, Iran, answered a self-reported questionnaire on ADHD. The questionnaire consisted of questions regarding socio-demographic characteristics such as age, the duration of practice as a GP, marital status, general knowledge about ADHD, and the management of ADHD.\nLess than half of them believed that they have adequate knowledge and information about this disorder. They usually do not like to be the primary care providers for children with ADHD. The majority of them prefer to refer the children to related specialists, mostly psychiatrists or psychologists. More than one third of them believed that sugar is a cause of ADHD. Only 6.6% of them reported that ADHD persists for the whole life. Their knowledge about methylphenidate is reasonable.\nAs many other countries worldwide, the knowledge of GPs about ADHD should be improved. They do not asses and manage children with probable ADHD by themselves without referring to related professionals. They do not opt for the use of methylphenidate."}, {"Title": "[The psychiatric treatment of Aby Warburg: a historical case report].", "Abstract": "Aby Warburg, one of the leading German intellectuals in the early 20 (th) century, developed a severe psychosis towards the end of WW I. Given up as incurable, he managed to recover after 6 years most of which he spent in three different mental hospitals. Although his treatment involved some of the best known psychiatrists of that time, it was later criticized as old-fashioned. As major parts of Warburg's case history have recently been published they now enable us to reconstruct and evaluate his treatment within the context of clinical concepts and methods available in the early 1920's. Apparently German-speaking psychiatry back then held no sufficient tools to adequately consider psychological factors both in the etiology and therapeutic response for Warburg's case. Instead his own scientific work played a crucial role in the \"restoration of reason\"."}, {"Title": "Implementing clinical guidelines in psychiatry: a qualitative study of perceived facilitators and barriers.", "Abstract": "Translating scientific evidence into daily practice is complex. Clinical guidelines can improve health care delivery, but there are a number of challenges in guideline adoption and implementation. Factors influencing the effective implementation of guidelines remain poorly understood. Understanding of barriers and facilitators is important for development of effective implementation strategies. The aim of this study was to determine perceived facilitators and barriers to guideline implementation and clinical compliance to guidelines for depression in psychiatric care.\nThis qualitative study was conducted at two psychiatric clinics in Stockholm, Sweden. The implementation activities at one of the clinics included local implementation teams, seminars, regular feedback and academic detailing. The other clinic served as a control and only received guidelines by post. Data were collected from three focus groups and 28 individual, semi-structured interviews. Content analysis was used to identify themes emerging from the interview data.\nThe identified barriers to, and facilitators of, the implementation of guidelines could be classified into three major categories: (1) organizational resources, (2) health care professionals' individual characteristics and (3) perception of guidelines and implementation strategies. The practitioners in the implementation team and at control clinics differed in three main areas: (1) concerns about control over professional practice, (2) beliefs about evidence-based practice and (3) suspicions about financial motives for guideline introduction.\nIdentifying the barriers to, and facilitators of, the adoption of recommendations is an important way of achieving efficient implementation strategies. The findings of this study suggest that the adoption of guidelines may be improved if local health professionals actively participate in an ongoing implementation process and identify efficient strategies to overcome barriers on an organizational and individual level. Getting evidence into practice and implementing clinical guidelines are dependent upon more than practitioners' motivation. There are factors in the local context, e.g. culture and leadership, evaluation, feedback on performance and facilitation, -that are likely to be equally influential."}, {"Title": "Modifying the risk of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of juvenile-onset schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "This review summarizes the evidence for use of typical and atypical antipsychotic medications for the treatment of juvenile-onset schizophrenia.

The severity of symptoms and frequencies of associated disabilities were similar in men and women. ADHD symptoms and related problems occurred in 50% of the female prisoners, which is similar to male prisoners according to the literature.\nThe high prevalence of symptoms and disabilities of ADHD in women should lead to awareness of the disorder in both sexes and be addressed in terms of diagnostic work-up, treatment, and rehabilitation."}, {"Title": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Inhibitors as Antidepressants.", "Abstract": "Affective and anxiety disorders are widely distributed disorders with severe social and economic effects. Evidence is emphatic that effective treatment helps to restore function and quality of life. Due to the action of most modern antidepressant drugs, serotonergic mechanisms have traditionally been suggested to play major roles in the pathophysiology of mood and stress-related disorders. However, a few clinical and several pre-clinical studies, strongly suggest involvement of the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway in these disorders. Moreover, several of the conventional neurotransmitters, including serotonin, glutamate and GABA, are intimately regulated by NO, and distinct classes of antidepressants have been found to modulate the hippocampal NO level in vivo. The NO system is therefore a potential target for antidepressant and anxiolytic drug action in acute therapy as well as in prophylaxis. This paper reviews the effect of drugs modulating NO synthesis in anxiety and depression."}, {"Title": "Beyond categorical diagnostics in psychiatry: Scientific and medicolegal implications.", "Abstract": "Conforming to a medical disease model rooted in phenomenology and natural science, psychiatry classifies mental disorders according to signs and symptoms considered to be stable and homogeneous across individuals. Scientific studies addressing the validity of this classification are scarce. Following a seminal paper by Robins and Guze in 1970, validity of categories has been sought in specific criteria referring to symptoms and prognosis, aggregation in families, and \"markers\", preferentially laboratory tests. There is, however, a growing misfit between the model and empirical findings from studies putting it to the test. Diagnostic categories have not been shown to represent natural groups delineated from the normal variation or from each other. Aetiological factors (genetic and/or environmental), laboratory aberrations, and treatment effects do not respect categorical boundaries. A more adequate description of mental problems may be achieved by: 1) a clear definition of the epistemological frame in which psychiatry operates, 2) a basic rating of the severity of intra- and interpersonal dysfunctions, and 3) empirical comparisons to complementary rather than exclusive dimensions of inter-individual differences in context-specific mental functions, treatment effects, and laboratory findings. Such a pluralistic understanding of mental health problems would fit empirical models in the neurosciences and postmodern notions of subjectivity alike. It would also clarify the assessment of dysfunction and background factors in relation to the requisites for penal law exemptions or insurance policies and make them empirically testable rather than dependent on expert opinion on issues such as whether a specific dysfunction is \"psychiatric\", \"medical\", or ascribable to \"personality\"."}, {"Title": "[Evolution and description of a complete hospitalisation unity in child and teenager psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The university department of child and adolescent psychiatry of Brest Hospital (a medium size town of 200,000 inhabitants) has at disposal a 14 in-patient emergency care unit, where young people under 16, mostly in crisis (individual and/or family and/or institutional crisis) are admitted. This unit opens 24h a day throughout the year, and patients with any type of pathology are admitted for a short stay, mainly with no demand for care. After a description of this unit with its modalities of functioning, the authors will report on its activity assessed from sets of data pertinent to the last 8 years. One thousand two hundred and twenty-five admittances were recorded over these 8 years. A very strong increase in the number of hospitalisation over the years (+201.4%) was also noticed. However, the sex-ratio remained quite alike with a majority of boys (55.3%), as well as the average stay duration (15.5 days in 2007). About the age at admittance, one should note that, after the relative stability observed in the first years, the average age has been decreasing regularly for the last 3 years to pass from 13.2 years for girls and 12.7years for boys in 2005 to 12.6 years (girls) and 11.2 years (boys) in 2007. Despite a rise in the number of children under placement in this region (Finist\u00e8re) between 2001 and 2006, the origin of the admittances has remained quite stable over 8 years: in 2007, 64.9% of the accepted children were living in their family, 24.6% in a foster care and 10.4% in a foster family. The evaluation of this hospitable cohort over several years allowed the authors to highlight various trends such as the explosion of the demand for medical care in both sexes, the rejuvenation of mental disorders, evolution in the motives for admittance with an important increase of psychomotor instability and externalised behavioural problems as well as the occurrence of new demands for care, e.g. the weaning of \"on-line\" video games or Internet. The growing expansion of NICT (new information and communication technologies) would invite them to appropriate them as tools in the meetings and to reconsider their restrictive position with respect to them. Finally, this rejuvenation of mental disorder(s), the occurrence of adolescent problems at an earlier age, together with their observation of the lengthening of the oedipian phase, whose elaboration seems more problematic than previously, have made them wonder about the contemporary characteristics of the phase of latency and the modalities of negotiation of this stage by their cohort of young people. These modifications have incited the authors to reconsider their offer of care and to propose alternatives to the hospitalisation through the recent development of a structure of home psychiatric-care. This new unit caused no arrest in the massive influx of the patients in complete hospitalisation, but it allowed them to optimise the care for some young people in complex situations through improvement of relationships with their various partners of the sanitary and socio-educational world (listening and support by the partners, exchanges of know-how in full awareness of complementarity, and work in the continuity during the stay at hospital [better prepared hospitalisation together with a better understanding of its interest by the child/teenager and the partners])."}, {"Title": "Effect of image analysis software on neurofunctional activation during processing of emotional human faces.", "Abstract": "Functional brain imaging techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI) that allow the in vivo investigation of the human brain have been exponentially employed to address the neurophysiological substrates of emotional processing. Despite the growing number of fMRI studies in the field, when taken separately these individual imaging studies demonstrate contrasting findings and variable pictures, and are unable to definitively characterize the neural networks underlying each specific emotional condition. Different imaging packages, as well as the statistical approaches for image processing and analysis, probably have a detrimental role by increasing the heterogeneity of findings. In particular, it is unclear to what extent the observed neurofunctional response of the brain cortex during emotional processing depends on the fMRI package used in the analysis. In this pilot study, we performed a double analysis of an fMRI dataset using emotional faces. The Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) version 2.6 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) and the XBAM 3.4 (Brain Imaging Analysis Unit, Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London, UK) programs, which use parametric and non-parametric analysis, respectively, were used to assess our results. Both packages revealed that processing of emotional faces was associated with an increased activation in the brain's visual areas (occipital, fusiform and lingual gyri), in the cerebellum, in the parietal cortex, in the cingulate cortex (anterior and posterior cingulate), and in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. However, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response in the temporal regions, insula and putamen was evident in the XBAM analysis but not in the SPM analysis. Overall, SPM and XBAM analyses revealed comparable whole-group brain responses. Further studies are needed to explore the between-group compatibility of the different imaging packages in other cognitive and emotional processing domains."}, {"Title": "Highly cited works in neurosurgery.

The aims of the present study were to determine whether the serum neopterin levels in patients with major depression (MD) differ from a healthy control group and to investigate the relationship between previous MD episodes and serum neopterin levels.\nThirty patients who were admitted to the GATA Psychiatry Outpatient Clinics and were diagnosed with MD according to DSM-IV, and who agreed to participate in the study, were included in the study. Twenty-six healthy volunteers matched for age, gender, and level of education who agreed to participate in the study were served as controls. Peripheral venous blood samples were obtained from the patients and the control group for complete blood count, routine biochemistry, and the detection of serum neopterin levels. The analyses were performed in the laboratory of the GATA Department of Biochemistry.\nThere was no significant difference between the MD group and the healthy controls with respect to age, level of education, smoking, and gender. Serum neopterin levels of the MD group who had experienced two or more episodes were higher than the first-episode group and the control group. Age of onset and the number of previous episodes had an independent impact on serum neopterin levels in MD patients, while smoking did not show any effect.\nIn the present study, the neopterin levels of patients who had experienced two or more episodes were higher than the first-episode depressive group and healthy control group.

Furthermore, as main outcome variable safety, psychopathological symptoms, and duration of an intervention cannot meet the demand to indicate subjective suffering and impact relevant to posttraumatic stress syndromes. An instrument used in controlled trials should assess the patients' subjective experiences, needs to be applicable to more than one intervention in order to compare different coercive measures and has to account for the specific psychiatric context.\nThe primary version of the questionnaire comprised 44 items, nine items on restrictions to human rights, developed on a clinical basis, and 35 items on stressors, derived from patients' comments during the pilot phase of the study. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using principal axis factoring (PAF) was carried out. The resulting factors were orthogonally rotated via VARIMAX procedure. Items with factor loadings less than .50 were eliminated. The reliability of the subscales was assessed by calculating Cronbach.\nData of 102 patients was analysed. The analysis yielded six factors which were entitled \"Humiliation\", \"Physical adverse effects\", \"Separation\", \"Negative environment\", \"Fear\" and \"Coercion\". These six factors explained 54.5% of the total variance. Cronbach alpha ranged from .67 to .93, which can be interpreted as a high internal consistency. Convergent and discriminant validity yielded both highly significant results (r = .79, p < .001, resp. r = .38, p < .001).\nThe \"Coercion Experience Scale\" is an instrument to measure the psychological impact during psychiatric coercive interventions. Its psychometric properties showed satisfying reliability and validity. For purposes of research it can be used to compare different coercive interventions. In clinical practice it can be used as a screening instrument for patients who need support after coercive interventions to prevent consequences from traumatic experiences. Further research is needed to identify possible diagnostic, therapeutic or prognostic implications of the total score and the different subscales.\nCurrent Controlled Trials ISRCTN70589121."}, {"Title": "Forty-four juvenile thieves revisited: from Bowlby to reactive attachment disorder.", "Abstract": "John Bowlby's work on attachment has had a major influence on practice in child and adolescent psychiatry and developed from observations Bowlby made in his clinical work. In a published case series of work with juvenile offenders, he provided a case description of the differing sets of problems that drove his interest. Clinical features described in a subgroup of these offenders, the 'affectionless psychopaths', might be recognized now as reactive attachment disorder (RAD).\nWe scrutinized Bowlby's case series '44 Juvenile Thieves' and compared the aetiology and clinical features of a subgroup of these children with the other 74 cases described by Bowlby. We selected one typical case as an exemplar and provide an edited version here. We then present one composite case from a recent study of RAD and provide a comparison with typically developing children.\nOf the Bowlby cases, 86% had experienced early prolonged separation from their primary caregivers and had experienced multiple care placements. In total, 10% of clinical comparisons had been similarly separated. In our recent sample, 66% of children experienced separation from primary caregivers compared with none of the comparison group. A similar proportion of our sample of children with RAD had been removed from home as a result of neglect or had experienced other forms of maltreatment.\nBowlby beleived that a main aetiological factor in the development of difficulties was the experience of separation. We suspect that a main aetiological factor in both his and our cases is the experience of maltreatment.

Nurses have direct and frequent contact with patients and their families, and are in a unique position to evaluate the situation of these children before problems arise. The aim of this study is to describe the interaction that practical mental health nurses (MHNs) and registered mental health currently have with children of their clients and predictors of this interaction when a parent is receiving psychiatric care. This is a cross-sectional study. In 2005, questionnaires were sent to all registered (n = 373) and practical MHNs (n = 235) working in 45 adult psychiatric inpatient and outpatient units in five Finnish university hospitals. The total response rate was 51%, while 60% (n = 222) of registered MHNs and 36% (n = 88) of practical MHNs responded. Most of the nurses did not meet children of their clients regularly, although they reported that information about children of the clients were gathered regularly at the units, and discussed clients' children with them. The personal characteristics of nurses, such as gender, age, marital status and being a parent, were significantly related to the nurse's propensity to pay attention to the children of their clients in adult psychiatry. Nurses' professional experience, further family education and use of family-centred care at the unit increased their interaction with the children of their patients. These results indicate that clients' children are not entirely invisible for most of the nurses in adult psychiatry. Knowledge of the risks faced by these children and implementation of the preventive approach should be included in the basic education of nurses."}, {"Title": "Left alone--Swedish nurses' and mental health workers' experiences of being care providers in a social psychiatric dwelling context in the post-health-care-restructuring era.

Approximately 0.7 percent of the adult population in Sweden suffers from severe mental illness leading to a need for community services. The primary aims of the Mental Health Reform in 1995 in Sweden were to improve the quality of life for people with severe, long-term mental illness and, through normalization and integration, enhancing their opportunities to communicate with and participate in society. This study examines nurses' and mental health workers' views and experiences of being care providers in a municipal psychiatric group dwelling context when caring for clients suffering from severe mental illness. Three focus group interviews were made and thematic content analysis was conducted. Four themes were formulated: 'Being a general human factotum not unlike the role of parents', 'Having a complex and ambiguous view of clients', 'Working in a mainly 'strangled' situation', and 'Feeling overwhelming frustration'. The staff, for instance, experienced a heavy workload that highly involved themselves as persons and restricted organization. The individual relational aspects of the nursing role, the risk of instrumentalizing the staff due to an organizational economical teleopathy (meaning a pathological desire to react goals), and the high societal demands on accomplishing the Mental Health Reform goals are discussed.

Focus groups were transcribed, analyzed, and coded for themes using a grounded theory approach.\nFive focus groups consisting of 14 faculty members from surgical specialties, psychiatry, anesthesia, and pediatrics were conducted. Grounded theory analysis of the 188 pages of text identified three major themes: Professionalism is not a static concept, a gap exists between faculty members' real and ideal experience of teaching professionalism, and \"unprofessionalism\" is a persistent problem. Important subthemes included the multiple bases that exist for defining professionalism, how professionalism is learned and taught versus how it should be taught, institutional and faculty tolerance and silence regarding unprofessionalism, stress as a contributor to unprofessionalism, and unprofessionalism arising from personality traits.\nAll faculty expressed that teaching and evaluating professionalism posed a challenge for them. They identified their own lapses in professionalism and their sense of powerlessness and failure to address these with one another as the single greatest barrier to teaching professionalism, given a perceived dominance of role modeling as a teaching tool.

Following categorization of suicidal attempters who visited the emergency room by outcome, we aimed to identify the characteristics and potential needs of each group.\nThe outcomes of 1348 individuals who attempted suicide and visited the critical care center or the psychiatry emergency department of the hospital were categorized into 3 groups, \"hospitalization in the critical care center (HICCC)\", \"hospitalization in the psychiatry ward (HIPW)\", or \"non-hospitalization (NH)\", and the physical, mental, and social characteristics of these groups were compared. In addition, multiple logistic analysis was used to extract factors related to outcome.\nThe male-to-female ratio was 1:2. The hospitalized groups, particularly the HICCC group, were found to have biopsychosocially serious findings with regard to disturbance of consciousness (JCS), general health performance (GAS), psychiatric symptoms (BPRS), and life events (LCU), while most subjects in the NH group were women who tended to repeat suicide-related behaviors induced by relatively light stress. The HIPW group had the highest number of cases, and their symptoms were psychologically serious but physically mild. On multiple logistic analysis, outcome was found to be closely correlated with physical severity, risk factor of suicide, assessment of emergent medical intervention, and overall care.\nThere are different potential needs for each group. The HICCC group needs psychiatrists on a full-time basis and also social workers and clinical psychotherapists to immediately initiate comprehensive care by a medical team composed of multiple professionals. The HIPW group needs psychological education to prevent repetition of suicide attempts, and high-quality physical treatment and management skill of the staff in the psychiatric ward.

Little is known of the relative effectiveness and tolerability of the two placements in the treatment of elderly, severely depressed inpatients.\nPatients of five public aged psychiatry services and a private psychiatric hospital who received right unilateral ECT (n=47) dosed on average at 3 times seizure threshold or bitemporal ECT (n=16) dosed at 1.5 times threshold completed an abbreviated Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, a visual memory test and a section of the Autobiographical Memory Inventory as close as possible to 24h after the first or second treatment and again after the fifth or sixth treatment. This design was intended to maximize recruitment of severely depressed patients with a limited ability to consent and cooperate with testing.\nOnly 35% of eligible patients completed both assessments, mostly due to refusal or lack of capacity to consent. Moderate dose unilateral and bilateral ECT produced equivalent improvements in mood. There was a tendency for scores on most cognitive tests to decline more with bilateral than unilateral ECT but these differences were statistically significant only for immediate verbal memory and autobiographical memory.\nOur findings suggest that bilateral ECT is no more effective as an antidepressant than moderately dosed unilateral ECT, at least on a short-term basis, and confers a slightly greater risk of cognitive impairment. This supports the rationale of prescribing unilateral ECT in the first instance in this vulnerable clinical population.\nIt proved impossible to recruit most ECT recipients, limiting the capacity to generalize findings to all aged patients. Reports concerning ECT should list recruitment rates to help set findings in context."}, {"Title": "A comparison of the efficacy of medications for adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder using meta-analysis of effect sizes.", "Abstract": "Medications used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults have been well researched, but comparisons among drugs are hindered by the absence of direct comparative trials. Our objectives were to (1) estimate the effect size of the medications used to treat adult ADHD, (2) determine if differences in the designs of studies confound comparisons of medication efficacy, (3) quantify the evidence for differences in effect sizes among medications, and (4) see if features of study design influence estimates of efficacy.\nThe following search engines were used: PubMed, Ovid, ERIC, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, the Cochrane database, e-psyche, and Social Sciences Abstracts. Presentations from the American Psychiatric Association and American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry meetings were reviewed.\nA literature search was conducted to identify double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of ADHD in adults published in English after 1979. Only trials that used DSM-III, -III-R, or -IV ADHD criteria and followed subjects for > or = 2 weeks were selected.\nMeta-analysis regression assessed the influence of medication type and study design features on medication effects.\nNineteen trials met criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. These trials studied 13 drugs using 18 different outcome measures of hyperactive, inattentive, or impulsive behavior. After trials were stratified on the class of drug studied (short-acting stimulant vs long-acting stimulant vs nonstimulant), significant differences in effect size were observed between stimulant and nonstimulant medications (P = .006 and P = .0001, respectively, for short- and long-acting stimulants vs nonstimulants), but the effect for short-acting stimulants was not significant after correcting for study design features. The effect sizes for each drug class were similar in magnitude to what we previously reported for medication treatment studies of children with ADHD. We found significant heterogeneity of effect sizes for short-acting stimulants (P < .001) but not for other medication groups.\nAlthough both stimulant and nonstimulant medications are effective for treating ADHD in adults, stimulant medications show greater efficacy for the short durations of treatment characteristic of placebo-controlled studies. We found no significant differences between short- and long-acting stimulant medications.

This incongruity presents a significant challenge for clinical work and efforts to revise the next iteration of the DSM. Auditory hallucinations found among \"normal\" people suggest that either AH are not as pathologic as they are typically taken to be, or that less-than-hallucinatory experiences are routinely mischaracterized as AH. Such hallucinations in the context of conversion disorder, trauma, sensory deprivation, and certain cultural settings strengthen an association between AH and psychopathology but suggest limited diagnostic specificity and relevance. It may be useful to think of AH like coughs-common experiences that are often, but not always, symptoms of pathology associated with a larger illness.

The anthropological approach to psychiatry in the work of Lammert van der Horst (1893-1978)].", "Abstract": "The anthropological approach was one of the new approaches to psychiatry that emerged in the interbellum. In The Netherlands professor Van der Horst (VU-university Amsterdam and the municipal University of Amsterdam) was its most prominent proponent. The general idea of the anthropological approach was to integrate the various ways of knowing then available. A psychiatric disease was seen as the result of a failure in the self-realisation of the individual person. This required to consider all relevant aspects relating to the patient's existence. How to tailor these ideas to concrete forms of diagnosis and methods of treatment was no easy matter and Van der Horst devoted himself all his life to this task. He first sought to classify man in three or four types of character inspired by the works of Heymans and Kretschmer. Then he tried to give the specific human aspect its place in psychiatry by introducing a 'pneumatic' dimension in his analysis of persons. He also connected this dimension to Calvinism, the church he belonged to. In the 1940's he made a turn towards existentialism and tried to connect this philosophy to anthropological psychiatry. In spite of its fragmentary appearance I believe it is possible to discern a degree of continuity in the work of Van der Horst. The concern with the specifically human was always central to him. Moreover Van der Horst saw no strict divide between addressing questions in psychiatry and thinking about the greater questions of life which provides an explanation for his meandering thoughts. The dissertation of J.H. van den Berg which appeared in 1946 offers an interesting contrast to Van der Horst. To Van den Berg the anthropological approach was no more than a method best developed by Binswanger. Van den Berg tested this method and concluded that the approach could offer hermeneutic insights at points where methods of the natural sciences fell short. These restrictions had the sake of clarity. In stark contrast, and in spite of all his efforts, many aspects in the work of Van der Horst remained obscure. However his search for an overarching anthropological approach to psychiatry is still interesting to us because it questions what the borders of the field actually are. Since the various approaches to psychiatry are still at best loosely integrated this question is of continuing relevance."}, {"Title": "[As a clincian beyond the boundaries of psychiatry. The congeniality of literature and psychiatry in the work of psychiatrist H.C. R\u00fcmke (1893-1967)].", "Abstract": "One of the most important Dutch psychiatrists in the interwar period was H.C. R\u00fcmke (1893-1967). With his eclectic interest in psychiatric approaches such as both psychoanalysis and phenomenology, R\u00fcmke is most well known for his remarkable diagnostic and therapeutic skills. The life and work of R\u00fcmke has been studied in detail, most notably by the Dutch historian Jacob Van Belzen. Despite this extensive research, in this paper it is stated that a relevant aspect of R\u00fcmke's work has been largely disregarded--namely his profound interest in and use of poetry and literature. Not only did R\u00fcmke write poems himself under the pseudonym of H. Cornelius, in his scholarly work he frequently refers to fictional literature and at the end of his career he wrote a comprehensive analysis of Frederik van Eeden's novel Van de Koele Meeren des Doods. For the eclectic clinician R\u00fcmke literature and poetry are a source of knowledge to gain insight into the human psyche. Furthermore, according to R\u00fcmke, often literature succeeds better at expressing the human condition than the science of psychiatry can. In this article it is argued that for a coherent interpretation of the life and work of R\u00fcmke this literal and poetic aspect of his work cannot be disregarded. It is precisely R\u00fcmke's profound interest in literature and poetry that reflects his two main theses about the science of psychiatry. These are on the one hand the centrality of clinical practice and on the other hand the boundaries of psychiatry. As a clinical practitioner R\u00fcmke's aim was to be able to understand the suffering of the patient - literature and poetry could help him do that. R\u00fcmke's use of literature and poetry can be understood by taking into account the context of the clinic, but the intertwinement between psychiatry, literature and poetry in R\u00fcmke's work also reflects a broader issue. Namely that the science of psychiatry is not omnipotent and that sometimes the arts are better equipped to grasp the human condition."}, {"Title": "[The pendulum, the gap, and the clinic. Leendert Bouman (1869-1936) and the 'psychological turn' in Dutch psychiatry].", "Abstract": "In recent historical literature, the Dutch psychiatrist Leendert Bouman (1869-1936) is named 'the godfather of psychological psychiatry'. He is regarded as one of the exponents of a shift or 'pendulum' movement from a biological-materialistic to a psychological, phenomenological orientation in the Dutch psychiatry of the Interbellum. As a professor of the orthodox calvinist Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam, he explicitly opposed a 'soul-less', biological-reductionist psychiatry. In addition, he played an important part in the introduction and spread of new'psychological' theories and especially Karl Jaspers' phenomenology in The Netherlands. It is one-sided and misleading, however, to refer to Bouman as a 'psychological' psychiatrist. Most of his scientific work was of a neurological and biological nature. He did not see biological (or nomothetic) and psychological (or idiographic) approaches as mutually exclusive, but as necessarily complementary. In this he followed Jaspers' distinction between and complementary use of the causal connections of psychic life (explanatory psychology) and meaningful psychic connections (psychology of meaning). Boumans pluralist orientation was rooted in his fundamentally clinical attitude toward psychiatry. In his view, a psychiatrist was in the first place a clinician. In the clinic, he stressed, a psychiatrist has to view and examine each individual patient in his bio-psycho-social totality. The case of Bouman illustrates that the history of psychiatry is by far richer and more complicated than is suggested by the standard account of that history being characterized by a pendulum movement and a one-dimensional struggle between 'somatic' and 'psychological' schools. It also suggests that the interaction between theory and clinical practice should be emphasized as an important dynamic factor in the history of psychiatry--next to or even above the dichotomy between 'biology' and 'psychology'."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry in multiplicity].", "Abstract": "According to a widespread interpretation, the history of psychiatry is characterized by a strong opposition between biological and psychological paradigms, which would dominate consecutive periods in history. The image of a swinging pendulum is a popular metaphor to describe this idea. The culture of Dutch psychiatry in the interwar years (1918-1940) seems to gainsay this image. Psychological, biological and socials models of explanation and therapy were used alongside each other without apparent debate and conflict. Influential professors of psychiatry like H.C. R\u00fcmke (Utrecht University) even pleaded for a conscious integration of these approaches. Some historians have interpreted this stance as a sign of scientific 'vagueness' and 'anarchy'. Analyzing the work of three major representatives of Dutch psychiatry in the Interbellum (Leendert Bouman, Han R\u00fcmke and Lammert van der Horst), the authors (former students of the master Historical and Comparative Studies of the Sciences and the Humanities) shed light on the psychiatric climate of this era, dealing with themes like the openness of psychiatry to other sciences, the interactions of psychiatry and literature, and the relationship between theory and clinical practice.

It is therefore, not surprising, that this stigmatization results in the refutation of the subsistence of a psychiatric problem in an individual and his family but also produces obstruction to help-seeking desires. To get a clear picture of the existence of psychiatric issues in the population, various research projects addressing psychiatric issues in children, women, and elderly are conducted both in Pakistan and India. A significant input has been taken from research conducted in India combating disaster management. In addition, public awareness programs are organized to provide information about common psychiatric disorders in children, adults, women, and the elderly.-Furthermore, psychiatric patients and their families are educated for the management of mental heath problems related to marriage, pregnancy, birth and hazards of smoking & substance abuse in young adults. Keeping in view the similarity in cultural background, treatment models, family structure, and psychosocial factors, collaborative research studies should be encouraged leading to improvement in psychiatric care of the patients both in India and Pakistan."}, {"Title": "History of psychiatry in India.", "Abstract": "History is a screen through which the past lightens the present and the present brightens the future. Psychiatry by virtue of its ability to deal with human thoughts and emotions and provide a pathway for healthy minds provides an important platform towards being a mentally sound human being and largely the society. This review takes a sneak peek into the foundations of modern psychiatry in India. The description is largely based on the time frame, which provides a better understanding of the factual information in each period starting from the Vedic era and culminating in the post independence period."}, {"Title": "Indian psychiatry, research and Asian countries.", "Abstract": "Asia has some of the largest conglomerations of human populations and also the fastest growing economies of the world. About 23% of the world's population lives in the South Asian region, and one-fifth of psychiatrically ill patients in the world live in this part of the world. Despite vast cultural, religious, geographical, and political diversities, the factors influencing mental health remain the same throughout this wide region, as highlighted at the recently concluded Asian summit, where the slogan, 'One vision, one identity, one community,' was launched. Thus, the need to strengthen regional cooperation in the field of mental health has always been felt. This article highlights facts about influence of Indian Psychiatry research as well as of some Asian countries in the world psychiatry and vice versa."}, {"Title": "Psychiatrists and neuroscientists of Indian origin in Canada: Glimpses.", "Abstract": "Psychiatrists of Indian origin are popular in Canada, being firmly rooted in the Canadian mental health system, and they have been making considerable contributions internationally. The Indian Psychiatric Society has long been collaborating with and inviting contributions from overseas Indian psychiatrists, particularly those in academics, and this collaboration has fructified well. There are several different challenges these psychiatrists have had to face in their own specialty work, with having to adjust to a new culture, new ways of living, and new ways of work. Our colleagues of Indian origin have demonstrated excellence in almost all fields of mental health and neurosciences. There are many popular teachers, outstanding researchers, and psychiatrists in community practice and community development. The Early Psychosis Program, Mood and Anxiety Program, Perinatal Psychiatry, Women's Mental Health, and Postpartum Mental Health are some of their key areas of research. Our basic scientists are involved in experimental design, neurochemistry, imaging, and genetics, where they have made their mark with acclaim. This article highlights some of the achievements of a few members and is by no means completely representative of the entire work that psychiatrists of Indian origin are doing in Canada, providing readers with a glimpse of our labors away from home."}, {"Title": "Mutual learning and research messages: India, UK, and Europe.", "Abstract": "India and UK have had a long history together, since the times of the British Raj. Most of what Indian psychiatry is today, finds its roots in ancient Indian texts and medicine systems as much as it is influenced by the European system. Psychiatric research in India is growing. It is being influenced by research in the UK and Europe and is influencing them at the same time. In addition to the sharing of ideas and the know-how, there has also been a good amount of sharing of mental health professionals and research samples in the form of immigrants from India to the UK. The Indian mental health professionals based in UK have done a good amount of research with a focus on these Indian immigrants, giving an insight into cross-cultural aspects of some major psychiatric disorders. This article discusses the impact that research in these countries has had on each other and the contributions that have resulted from it."}, {"Title": "Indian - American contributions to psychiatric research.", "Abstract": "The Indian Diaspora, especially in North America, is a visible force in the field of psychiatric medicine. An estimated 5000 persons of Indian origin practice psychiatry in the USA and Canada, and an estimated 10% of these are in academic psychiatry. Wide ranging contributions, from molecular biology of psychiatric disorders to community and cultural psychiatry, are being made by this vibrant group of researchers.

Keeping with the trends world over, the number of women psychiatrists in India has been on the rise over the last two to three decades. The authors searched various volumes of the Indian Journal of Psychiatry, recent membership directories of the Indian Psychiatric Society, website of the Medical Council of India and personal communications for contributions of the women psychiatrists in India. Women psychiatrists have a number of contributions to their credit in India. They have played important roles in the affairs of national professional organizations like the Indian Psychiatric Society and have contributed to the psychiatry education and research. However, they also suffer limitations because of the absence of adequate institutional support and policies looking into their specific needs."}, {"Title": "Liaison psychiatry and Indian research.", "Abstract": "Liaison in Psychiatry refers to the branch of Psychiatry involving assessment and treatment in the general hospital of referred patients, like in the casualty, or patients of deliberate self farm. The Indian scene also reveals major reference from medicine, surgery, surgical super specialty and orthopedics with psychiatric disorders like anxiety, depression and / or organic brain syndromes seen in about 40 to 50 % of the medical or surgical patients. Though the Indian published data is limited, most tertiary hospitals in India carry out liaison work with various departments like Neurology, Organ transplant, Intensive Care Units and Cosmetic Surgery, so as to give comprehensive health services to patients. Liaison in Psychiatry has thus brought the emphasis on the teaching of psycho-social aspects of medicine and also increased research possibilities."}, {"Title": "Indian psychiatry: Research and international perspectives.", "Abstract": "Indian psychiatry has many contributions to the world psychiatry to its credit. These include active participation in the international scientific organizations, research, and also creation of the manpower resources in many other countries. India has been an active partner in the research initiatives of the World Health Organization and the World Psychiatric Association. Research by the Indian psychiatrists played an important role in recognition of the entity of acute and transient psychotic disorders, some culture bound syndromes like Dhat syndrome and understanding the role of families in care of schizophrenia and course and outcome of schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Indian scales and inventories.", "Abstract": "This conceptual, perspective and review paper on Indian scales and inventories begins with clarification on the historical and contemporary meanings of psychometry before linking itself to the burgeoning field of clinimetrics in their applications to the practice of clinical psychology and psychiatry. Clinimetrics is explained as a changing paradigm in the design, administration, and interpretation of quantitative tests, techniques or procedures applied to measurement of clinical variables, traits and processes. As an illustrative sample, this article assembles a bibliographic survey of about 105 out of 2582 research papers (4.07%) scanned through 51 back dated volumes covering 185 issues related to clinimetry as reviewed across a span of over fifty years (1958-2009) in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry.

Though the first paper related to Behavior Therapy was published in 1952, a manual search of all available issues of the journal from 1949 showed that only 42 papers related to Behavior Therapy have been published till 2009. Among them 10 are case reports. Methodological limitations abound even in the papers on larger groups of patients. Studies using operant conditioning have been very few. Aversion therapy and progressive muscle relaxation have been very frequently used. The published articles are reviewed under the various diagnostic categories. Publications in the recent years have been mostly on Cognitive Behavior Therapy. Even after 57 years of co-existence, the relationship between Behavior Therapy and Indian Psychiatry remains a tenuous one."}, {"Title": "Psychotherapy in India.", "Abstract": "The articles that appeared in Indian Journal of Psychiatry were related to different areas of psychotherapy. Case reports dealt with a wide variety of cases. The review papers focused on the suitability of psychotherapy in the Indian context, different approaches in psychotherapy, psychotherapy training and supervision. Psychotherapy has been viewed very close to faith orientation. There were attempts to identify the indigenous concepts that are applicable to psychotherapy. Empirical studies are low in number. Concerted effort is needed to generate interest in psychotherapy, conduct more research on evidence-based therapies as well as on psychotherapeutic process variables."}, {"Title": "Research on electroconvulsive therapy in India: An overview.", "Abstract": "The contribution of researchers from India in the field of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been substantial. Over 250 papers have been published by authors from India in the past five decades on this issue; about half of these have appeared in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry. This article summarizes the papers on ECT research that have appeared in the Journal. A bulk of these articles has focused on establishing the efficacy in different disorders. Considerable numbers of papers describe refinement in the ECT procedure, including anesthetic modification, ECT machine and EEG monitoring.

Despite the decline in the use of ECT across the globe, papers on ECT have only increased in the recent decades in the Journal."}, {"Title": "Military psychiatry in India.", "Abstract": "Military personnel, because of the unique nature of their duties and services, are likely to be under stress which at times has no parallel in civilian life. The stress of combat and service in extreme weather conditions often act as major stressors. The modern practices in military psychiatry had their beginning during the two World Wars, more particularly, the II(nd) World War. The GHPU concept had the beginning in India with military hospitals having such establishments in the care of their clientele. As the nation gained independence, many of the military psychiatrists shifted to the civil stream and contributed immensely in the development of modern psychiatry in India. In the recent years military psychiatry has been given the status of a subspecialty chapter and the military psychiatrists have been regularly organizing CMEs and training programs for their members to prepare them to function in the special role of military psychiatrists."}, {"Title": "Indian culture and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "'Culture' is an abstraction, reflecting the total way of life of a society. Culture uniquely influences mental health of people living in a given society. Similarity in thinking and understanding of mental health across the ancient cultures has been observed. Studies which relate to the demographic factors, cultural factors influencing presentation of illness, diagnosis of the illness-culture bound syndromes and influence of the cultural factors and the belief system on psychopathology, stigma and discrimination towards the patient have been reviewed.

Key words like disasters, earthquake, cyclone, tsunami and flood were searched from its electronic database and relevant articles are discussed. The cross-referenced articles and relevant researches conducted on disasters in India which are published elsewhere were the secondary sources of information. There have been many epidemiological studies and only a few interventional studies on disasters in India. Prevalence figures of psychiatric disorders varied considerably across studies, secondary to nature and severity of disaster, degree of loss, support available and probably also due to the study methodology. Suggestions for intervention included pre-disaster planning, training of disaster workers, utilization of community-level volunteers as counselors, and strengthening existing individual, social and spiritual coping strategies.

Sexual variation deals with those facets of sexual behavior which are not necessarily pathological. It is any given culture that defines what is abnormal and what is deviant. In scriptures, literature and poetry in India same sex love has been described and explained in a number of ways. In this paper we highlight homosexual behavior and the role of hijras in the Indian society, among other variations. These are not mental illnesses and these individuals are not mentally ill. Hence the role of psychiatry and psychiatrists has to be re-evaluated. Attitudes of the society and the individual clinicians may stigmatize these individuals and their behavior patterns. Indian psychiatry in recent times has made some progress in this field in challenging attitudes, but more needs to be done in the 21(st) century. We review the evidence and the existing literature."}, {"Title": "Research priorities for Indian psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This article summarises the findings of recent priority setting exercises for psychiatric research and of a mapping of research capacity and resources in south Asia. The priorities for research in the region, as in other developing countries, are related to 'implementation' science, i.e. the field of inquiry investigating acceptable and affordable methods of delivering effective treatments for mental disorders, which aims to help close the large treatment gap. \"Discovery\" research which aims to strengthen our understanding of the nature of mental disorders through well-designed epidemiological and descriptive clinical studies, and expand the armamentarium of effective treatments by mapping and evaluating indigenous approaches to mental health care is also an important priority. However, research capacity and resources in the region are scarce and need strengthening by action from diverse stakeholders including the Indian Psychiatric Society."}, {"Title": "Indian research on sleep disorders.", "Abstract": "Literature on sleep disorders from our country, India, can mainly be found in the Indian journal of Sleep medicine, Indian Journal of psychiatry, The Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology and certain other journals and books.

The comorbidity data world over reflects that it is a much more common phenomenon than observed in routine clinical practice. In India, research into this domain of psychiatry has been limited, with comorbidity reported to be as high as 60%. In the few publications in this area, most of the authors have looked into substance related comorbidity. Small numbers of studies have looked into comorbid conditions in child psychiatry, especially mental retardation and very few studies have looked at other comorbidities. The landmarks in the studies in the area of psychiatric comorbidity have been highlighted in this review article."}, {"Title": "Indian research on women and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The paper discusses research on various issues related to mental health specific to women, published mainly in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry. We carried out a manual search of all the issues of the journal. Indian psychiatrists have worked in a wide range of areas including psychological aspects of different reproductive phases like pregnancy, puerperium, menopause, menstrual cycle, psychological consequences of contraception, infertility and surgical loss of uterus or breast. Most of the studies are cross sectional with very few prospective studies. There is a need for longitudinal, epidemiological and intervention studies."}, {"Title": "Learning and other developmental disorders in India.", "Abstract": "Articles that include Learning and Developmental Disorders have been gathered from the Indian Journal of Psychiatry (IJP) archives, and are broadly discussed. Learning disorders (LD) are not pure syndromes. They are developmental disorders and are multi-dimensional in nature. Research areas in Child Psychiatry in India remain largely unexplored, especially developmental disorders. The potential for research is mind boggling.

Its ubiquity in humans, and its presence in a range of anxiety disorders, makes it an important clinical focus. Developments in nosology, epidemiology and psychobiology have led to significant advancement in our understanding of the anxiety disorders in recent years. Advances in pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy of these disorders have brought realistic hope for relief of symptoms and improvement in functioning to patients. Neurotic disorders are basically related to stress, reaction to stress (usually maladaptive) and individual proneness to anxiety. Interestingly, both stress and coping have a close association with socio-cultural factors. Culture can effect symptom presentation, explanation of the illness and help-seeking. Importance given to the symptoms and meaning assigned by the physician according to their cultural background also differs across culture. In this way culture can effect epidemiology, phenomenology as well as treatment outcome of psychiatric illness especially anxiety disorders. In this review an attempt has been made to discuss such differences, as well as to reflect the important areas in which Indian studies are lacking. An attempt has been made to include most Indian studies, especially those published in Indian Journal of Psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The evolution of Indian psychiatric research: An examination of the early decades of the Indian Journal of Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Research in psychiatry has travelled far since the inception of the Indian Journal of Psychiatry (IJP) in 1949. We reviewed publications in the IJP during its initial three decades to identify path breaking articles and trends in research. We present the evolution of research design in the IJP from cases studies to randomized controlled trials. We identify the earliest studies in different fields, ranging from drug trials to social interventions, and from women's mental health to geriatric psychiatry. We consider special issues such as the measurement of psychopathology specific to the Indian context, studies of treatments specific to Indian traditions, epidemiology of psychiatric disorders in India, and innovations in service delivery. Students interested in the history of Indian psychiatric research will be rewarded by the richness and variety of thought evidenced in the publications in the early decades of the IJP."}, {"Title": "Substance use and addiction research in India.", "Abstract": "Substance use patterns are notorious for their ability to change over time. Both licit and illicit substance use cause serious public health problems and evidence for the same is now available in our country. National level prevalence has been calculated for many substances of abuse, but regional variations are quite evident. Rapid assessment surveys have facilitated the understanding of changing patterns of use. Substance use among women and children are increasing causes of concern. Preliminary neurobiological research has focused on identifying individuals at high risk for alcohol dependence. Clinical research in the area has focused primarily on alcohol and substance related comorbidity. There is disappointingly little research on pharmacological and psychosocial interventions. Course and outcome studies emphasize the need for better follow-up in this group. While lack of a comprehensive policy has been repeatedly highlighted and various suggestions made to address the range of problems caused by substance use, much remains to be done on the ground to prevent and address these problems. It is anticipated that substance related research publications in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry will increase following the journal having acquired an 'indexed' status."}, {"Title": "An overview of Indian research in bipolar mood disorder.", "Abstract": "This review has been done after careful research of articles published in indian journal of psychiatry with the search words of manic depressive psychosis and bipolar mood disorder.

Since then, it has steadily published more than 200 papers on one or the other aspect of schizophrenia. From rudimentary research methodology and descriptive approach, schizophrenia research, as published in the Journal, seems to have come of age with more and more sophisticated research designs and methodologies. Our ardent researchers have made significant contributions in the understanding of this riddle called schizophrenia. Notable contributions have been made in the field of epidemiology, course and outcomes and phenomenology of this disorder. However, research in psycho-social rehabilitation of schizophrenia and related areas is sparse and sporadic. The need to conduct research that impacts health policies and planning of services for this disorder is evident and our researchers would do well to provide impetus in these areas."}, {"Title": "Indian research on aging and dementia.", "Abstract": "All the articles published in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry (IJP) from 1958 to 2009 on aging, dementia and other mental health issues of late life were systematically reviewed. There were only a limited number of research articles on dementia in the IJP. Most of the Indian studies on dementia were published elsewhere. People above the age of 60 years constitute about 5% of patients seen in tertiary care settings. High prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was reported among community resident older people. Depression was the commonest mental health problem in late life. We need to develop community-based interventions for management of common conditions like depression in late life. The effectiveness of these interventions needs to be established. It is important to identify risk factors for depression and dementia in our population. We could then try and modify these factors to reduce the prevalence of these conditions."}, {"Title": "Indian research on acute organic brain syndrome: Delirium.", "Abstract": "Delirium, though quite often referred to psychiatrists for management, does not find many takers for analysis, research and publications. Acute in onset, multiplicity of etiology and manifestations, high risk of mortality delirium is very rewarding in proper management and outcome. Delirium has a limited agenda on teaching programs, research protocols and therapeutic strategies. There is a dearth of Indian studies both in international and national scientific literature. This annotation is based on a Medline search for \"delirium India\" on Pubmed, which resulted in 54 articles. A search in Indian Journal of Psychiatry for \"delirium\" resulted in 38 published articles, \"delirium tremens\" showed up only five articles.

Indian Journal of Psychiatry (IJP), as its flag-ship publication, has mirrored this trend faithfully down the decades. Stalwarts and icons of Indian psychiatry have set Indian research firmly on this course. A systematic appraisal of psychiatric research in India shows that most work is replicative, some of it corrective at the local level, and very little that is original and corrective at the international level. Opinion and policy makers, including IJP and research departments at colleges and universities, must endeavor to steer the course towards trend-setting and original work emanating from India, even as we do not neglect replicative work, of which we are masters."}, {"Title": "Cognitive psychiatry in India.", "Abstract": "Cognitive deficits have been shown to exist in various psychiatric disorders. Though most Indian studies pertaining to cognition have been replication studies, well designed original studies have also been conducted.

These biological changes provide some explicit insight into the complex area of 'brain-mind and behavior'. One major achievement of research in biological field is the finding to explain how biological factors cause changes in behavior. In India, we have a clear history of initiatives in research from a biological perspective, which goes back to 1958. In the last 61 years, this field has seen significant evolution, precision and effective utilization of contemporary technological advances. It is a matter of great pride to see that in spite of difficult times in terms of challenges of practice and services, administration, resource, funding and manpower the zest for research was very forthcoming. There was neither dedicated time nor any funding for conducting research. It came from the intellectual insight of our fore fathers in the field of mental health to gradually grow to the state of strategic education in research, training in research, international research collaborations and setting up of internationally accredited centers. During difficult economic conditions in the past, the hypothesis tested and conclusions derived have not been so important. It is more important how it was done, how it was made possible and how robust traditions were established. Almost an entire spectrum of biological research has been touched upon by Indian researchers. Some of these are electroconvulsive therapy, biological markers, neurocognition, neuroimaging, neuroendocrine, neurochemistry, electrophysiology and genetics. A lot has been published given the limited space in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry and other medical journals published in India. A large body of biological research conducted on Indian patients has also been published in International literature (which I prefer to call non-Indian journals). Newer research questions in biological psychiatry, keeping with trend of international standards are currently being investigated by the younger generation with great enthusiasm. What we have achieved so far is the foundation work in last 60 years. Our main challenge in development of biological psychiatry research in India remains resources in terms of manpower, funding and dedicated time for research psychiatrists. Developing basic sciences laboratories, discrete research questions, high quality methodology, and logistical support are some of the essentials. In the present time the culture of research has changed. It is specific and evidence-based. We have time-tested examples of International collaborative research. We need to get more resources, develop education, collaboration and effective leadership. In times to come, India will provide international leadership in basic and clinical biological psychiatry. There is hope."}, {"Title": "Indian Psychiatry and classification of psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "The contribution of Indian psychiatry to classification of mental disorders has been limited and restricted to acute and transient psychosis and to possession disorders.

However, how much the average subject actually understands of the information contained in these informed consent forms is uncertain.\nIn a cross sectional study, the translated informed consent forms used in psychiatric clinical trials were assessed with respect to their ease of readability.\nWe analyzed 30 informed consent forms translated from English to Hindi used in multinational and multicentre psychiatric clinical trials sponsored by different sponsors. We examined consent forms for readability scores and factors that might relate to readability.\nThe mean readability score for the informed consent forms, determined by the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Index (FKGL) was grade levels of 13.66. The ease of readability assessed by the Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES) was 46.08 suggesting significant complexity of the texts. These values carry even more significance when the average years of schooling for India as a whole are 6.2 years.\nOur results show that the most informed consent forms were too complex to understand by an average adult subject. We suggest reducing this complexity and increasing the ease of readability so those average subjects receive the intended information as exactly as it could be. This can be achieved by few simple measures like improving the deficiencies in translation processes, encouraging the investigators to participate while preparing these forms, and enhanced understanding of the site specific requirements, namely culture, language (dialect), general literacy rate, etc."}, {"Title": "Revalidation: Are we Meeting Training Needs? Training and its Influence on the Practice of Child Psychiatry and Psychotherapy.", "Abstract": "Revalidation and renewal of registration are issues of concern to most psychiatrists. Keeping up-to-date with current knowledge is an essential part of the renewal of license to practice. Training needs of psychiatrists are addressed in postgraduate courses and the gaps in training and updating of knowledge addressed through continuing medical education programs. This study aims to look at whether the training needs of psychiatrists working in the state of Kerala are being met. Two aspects of training and practice, child and adolescent psychiatry and psychotherapy, were assessed using a questionnaire. A significant number of respondents had not received any training in either of these areas in their postgraduate training. This did not affect their practice; most respondents continued to practice psychotherapy and see child patients despite not being trained. These two areas can thus be identified as lacunae in the curriculum as well as a need which should be addressed through Continuation Medical education programs."}, {"Title": "[Pierre Janet's views on the etiology, pathogenesis and therapy of dissociative and conversion disorders (\"hysterias\")].", "Abstract": "Pierre Janet (1859-1947) is one of those more or less forgotten authors whose approach differed significantly from Freud's psychoanalysis. In the first part of this paper, Janet's conception of hysteria is discussed and his place in French psychiatry described. Different aspects of Janet's diathesis-stress-approach are presented (particularly his important pathogenic concept of fixed ideas) which refer not only to a conception of hysteria, but also to traumatic (stress) disorders and other psychological disturbances. The second part of the paper details the varieties of Janetian therapeutic treatments for these disorders: the 'liquidation' of fixed ideas by hypnosis and suggestion, confrontation techniques which resemble contemporary cognitive behavioural approaches, and special cognitive (\"logagogic\") interventions. Finally, we also discuss the various treatment strategies Janet proposes for dealing with symptoms, such as asthenic or depressive states, from his psycho-economic perspective."}, {"Title": "[Melancholia and depression--from madness to illness].", "Abstract": "In present time depression affects 3-5% of the population in the western countries. Has this illness always existed? Can it be traced backwards in historical periods? The answer is a reluctant yes. The term \"depression\" has been in use in psychiatry for only 150 years and the very term \"psychiatry\" for 200 years. Before 1800, in classical times, only few elements of modern depression were part of the concept of \"melancholia\". Classical melancholia was a madness of the few, presenting with \"psychotic\" symptoms according to present terminology. The depression of modern man is a much broader concept including elements of well-being and capacity to work. Thus, although psychotic symptoms seem to connect the terms melancholia and depression, scientific, social and cultural developments separate the two.

Various intrinsic and extrinsic factors are discussed to be responsible for this increase of mood disorders. In the present study the association patterns between mild geriatric depression and the individual reproductive history are analyzed. 264 subjects, 167 females and 97 males, ageing between 60 and 95 years (mean 72.3, SD 8.1 yrs) were enrolled in the present study. The prevalence of depression was tested by mean of the geriatric depression scale (GDS), additionally reproductive history was documented. It turned out, that with increasing number of offspring the depression score decreased. Childless women exhibited the highest prevalence of mild depression and the highest mean depression score. These association patterns between reproductive history and depressive disorders during old age were discussed by means of Darwinian psychiatry. A low number of offspring or childlessness and a lack of social networks for support are new in the evolutionary history of Homo sapiens. Mild geriatric depression may be interpreted as a result of a mismatch or dysregulation because the recent social environment of elderly is completely different from that in which Homo sapiens evolved. The occurrence of geriatric depression may be an adaptation to this new situation."}, {"Title": "[Elements for an history of the therapeutic community in Western psychiatry of the 2nd half of the 20th century].", "Abstract": "Based on a critique of the traditional ruling of mental hospital, therapeutic community is an innovative model elaborated in Great Britain during World War II.

These new methods should be based on objectively measured brain characteristics that provide clinically useful information. Studying the brain with respect to psychiatric disorders, however, faces numerous challenges. Utilizing techniques learned in other areas of medicine to deal with symptoms that lead to complex disorders can provide insight into improving diagnostic models in psychiatry. Specifically, many areas of medicine use objective measures of an organ's function or characteristic to guide clinical management of particular subjective complaints. In psychiatry, an objectively measured brain characteristic that provides clinically useful information is proposed to be that person's \"phronotype.\" Important requirements to developing phronotypes are discussed. Identifying phronotypes in psychiatry will require a specific investigative approach that must be grounded in rigorous scientific methodology.

Psycho-oncology is expected to play an important role in cancer care. The \"Basic Plan to Promote Cancer Control Programs\" was launched in 2007 under the Cancer Control Act, and it noted the need to increase the number of psycho-oncologists in order to promote palliative care in the early phases of cancer treatment. Additionally, guidelines for new cancer care systems incorporating psychiatrists were established; these guidelines included provisions stipulating that designated cancer care hospitals should have psychiatry departments, and that palliative care teams including psychiatrists were to be covered by insurance. This report describes the first year of operation of the newly established psycho-oncology department at the Chiba Cancer Center. The primary clinical activities of the psycho-oncology department comprise psychiatric consultations for inpatients and psychiatric care for outpatients with cancer and their family caregivers; there is no psychiatric ward. More than half of referred patient were diagnosed with adjustment disorders, major depression, or normal reactions. These patients required support in connection with the psychological adjustment to cancer distress or rehabilitation. The education and training of hospital staff and community medical staff is another role for psycho-oncology. In one palliative care training program, a psycho-oncologist directed the psychological symptoms management module and medical communications module. Psychiatrists at cancer centers or designated cancer care hospitals are expected to play multiple roles in the care of cancer patients and their families. They are occasionally unable to meet these expectations, however, due to a lack of understanding by hospital administrators, lack of time to spend on activities other than standard psychiatric services, and, in the case of some psychiatrists, a lack of interest in cancer care.

In addition, publicly available information on various genotyping tests was sought from the internet and advisory panel members.\nA systematic review of analytical validity, clinical validity and clinical utility of CYP testing was undertaken. Data were extracted into structured tables and narratively discussed, and meta-analysis was undertaken when possible. A review of economic evaluations of CYP testing in psychiatry and a review of economic models related to schizophrenia were also carried out.\nFor analytical validity, 46 studies of a range of different genotyping tests for 11 different CYP polymorphisms (most commonly CYP2D6) were included. Sensitivity and specificity were high (99-100%). For clinical validity, 51 studies were found. In patients tested for CYP2D6, an association between genotype and tardive dyskinesia (including Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale scores) was found. The only other significant finding linked the CYP2D6 genotype to parkinsonism. One small unpublished study met the inclusion criteria for clinical utility.

Functional imaging can point at specific disturbances in information processing in neural networks. Besides imaging of receptor and metabolic functions with PET and fMRI, electromagnetic methods such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) offer the possibility for imaging of dynamic dysfunctions. As compared to EEG, MEG has a shorter history and is less common despite offering considerable advantages in temporospatial resolution and sensitivity to detect impaired signal processing and network functioning which renders it particularly interesting for psychiatric applications. Disturbed processing in the auditory and visual domain emerging in schizophrenic, affective and anxiety disorders can be detected with high sensitivity. Moreover, the neuromagnetic baseline activity allows conclusions to be drawn regarding neural network functions.

However, the publication of guidelines alone does not ensure their consistent implementation. The use of treatment pathways represents one possible approach to help implement the complex treatment recommendations contained in the S3 Guidelines. The first computer-assisted treatment pathway for patients with schizophrenic psychoses was successfully incorporated into the everyday routine of psychiatric hospitals. The aim of the present study was to systematically analyse the impact of this measure on guideline compliance.\nBased on the S3 Guidelines for the Treatment of Schizophrenia developed by the German Association of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Neurology (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Psychiatrie, Psychotherapie und Nervenheilkunde; DGPPN), diagnostic and treatment procedures were defined by a multiprofessional working group with members from five different hospitals and subsequently incorporated into an existing hospital information system. In one of the five hospitals, the impact of this measure was analysed in a pilot study in a systematic manner. In the year 2007, approximately 100 patients in each of two wards in the hospital received in a parallel group design either standard care or care based on a computer-assisted treatment pathway. Based on their place of residence, patients were assigned to the two units consecutively. Both groups were analysed to determine the extent to which the care they received conformed to treatment guidelines. Data available from the years 2004 and 2005 served as a historical comparison to the present results.\nThe differences in guideline compliance between the two wards were heterogeneous and, in certain respects, counterintuitive. As expected, the treatment pathway group showed an increased number of laboratory tests, more frequent drug screening at hospital admission and more appropriate dosing of neuroleptics. However, the rate of participation in psychoeducational interventions was disappointing. A conspicuous finding was the negative relationship between initial disease severity and compliance with guidelines on psychopharmacological treatment. In contrast, the historical comparison revealed that guideline compliance had increased slightly in both the treatment pathway and standard treatment groups.\nDeveloping computer-assisted treatment pathways based on S3 Guidelines and incorporating them into existing hospital information systems is feasible and well accepted by users. The initial effects on guideline compliance are mostly positive, but not strongly so. Moreover, there was a reduction in duration of hospital stay.

Research aiming at improvements of criminal justice and treatment is a societal priority, and the total benefit of studies has to be balanced against the risks for research subjects inferred by almost all systematic studies. Direct substantial risks must be balanced by health benefits, and normal informed consent requirements apply. When direct risks are slight, as in register-based epidemiology, lack of consent may be counter-balanced by special measures to protect integrity and the general benefit of better understanding of susceptibility, treatment and prevention. Special requirements on consent procedures in the forensic psychiatric context are suggested, and the issue of the relation between decision competence and legal accountability is found to be in need of further study.

An analysis of narratives of the incident reveals Hmong conceptions of the anthropologist's physical, mental and moral affliction, its causative concomitants and his ritual healing. Hmong mental health and identity are situated in a moral space of exchange relationships to significant others, challenging basic assumptions of concepts of the person widely held in psychiatry and beyond. The healing ritual transformed the author's being from indeterminate \"other,\" in a life-threatening state of identity crisis, to a wholesome Hmong \"self,\" in a state of health and moral agency. This exemplary rite de passage highlights the affinity of ritual healing and constitution of self in a moral space.

In the 1950s, when American psychiatry under psychoanalytic dominance had little interest in psychiatric diagnosis, Edwin Gildea recruited to the Department of Psychiatry at Washington University faculty who advocated a medical model for psychiatry in which diagnosis had a central role. In 1967, at the urging of the then-resident John Feighner, a discussion group led by Eli Robins and including Sam Guze, George Winokur, Robert Woodruff, and Rod Mu\u00f1oz began meeting with the initial goal of writing a review of prior key contributions to psychiatric diagnosis. In their meetings over the next year, the task soon shifted to the development of a set of new diagnostic criteria. For three diagnoses, major depression, antisocial personality disorder, and alcoholism, the authors could identify the original criteria from which this group worked and the rationale for many of the changes they introduced. Published in 1972, the Feighner criteria were soon widely cited and used in research, and they formed the basis for the development of the Research Diagnostic Criteria, which in turn were central to the development of DSM-III.

Scales completed during admission elicited sociodemographic data, psychiatric history, mental and physical functioning, illness behavior, coping modes, and number of close relationships.

Family psychiatric history, education, and poorer physical and mental functioning during hospitalization predicted persistence of depression. Poorer mental functioning, less denial, and greater number of close relationships predicted persistence of anxiety disorders. Higher levels of education, use of acceptance-resignation as a coping mechanism, and greater hypochondriasis predicted persistence of somatoform disorders.\nThe belief that psychiatric disorders in hospitalized medically ill patients spontaneously remit after discharge is false. A substantial proportion persist for at least 3 months. Early detection and treatment is possible and warranted.

The purpose of this paper is to review the literature concerning the learning needs of healthcare professionals in relation to managing confusion in the older patient in order to inform effective educational approaches for Liaison Old Age Psychiatry teams.\nA broad range of medical and educational databases were searched. Identified English language studies were selected for further analysis if they had a specific educational focus in the hospital setting and then further subdivided into intervention and naturalistic studies. The impact of intervention studies was evaluated by Kirkpatrick's system. Learning needs, as determined from the naturalistic studies, were mapped to identify themes.\n13 intervention studies were identified. Despite a high level of effectiveness for educational interventions, it was unclear what the active components were. A further 23 naturalistic studies were identified; their findings focused on knowledge gaps, diagnostic behaviors and experiences, attitudes and training issues. Few studies specifically researched learning needs or the educational role of liaison teams. Conspicuous by its absence was reference to relevant educational theories.\nThe findings of this review can be incorporated in the planning of local curricula by Liaison Teams in order to design educational strategies. There is a need for further research, especially studies exploring the learning needs of all healthcare professionals."}, {"Title": "Dental health of community-living older people attending secondary healthcare: a cross-sectional comparison between those with and without diagnosed mental illness.", "Abstract": "Mental illness and cognitive impairment are risk factors for poor dental health.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study to compare the dental health of older patients attending out-patient clinics and day hospitals of old age psychiatry services (the psychiatry group, n = 103) with those attending general/geriatric medical services (the medical group; n = 99). Those living in care homes, and those with diagnosed mental illness (in the medical group) were excluded. A registered mental health nurse assessed mental and general health using validated and previously published instruments. A registered dentist made an independent assessment of dental health (examination to assess oral pathology, status of remaining teeth, and dentures) and made an overall judgment about whether the patient needed any dental treatment (a \"normative\" need).\nThe normative need for dental treatment was significantly higher among the psychiatry group compared to the medical group (85% vs 52%; p<0.001); even after taking account of the effect of age, gender, teeth status, physical comorbidity, cognition, depressive symptoms, and overall mental and social health [adjusted odds ratio, OR (95% confidence interval): 4.32 (2.09, 8.91)]. The presence of any natural remaining teeth [OR: 4.44 (2.10, 9.42)] and Barthel Index [OR: 0.96 (0.93, 0.99)] were the two other independent predictors of the need for treatment.\nDental problems are common in community-living older people, especially those with some natural remaining teeth and those with mental illness. There is a need to develop integrated mental health and dental care services for older people with emphasis on prevention of dental problems."}, {"Title": "Catatonia and its treatment.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric diagnoses are currently categorized on a syndromic basis. The syndrome of catatonia, however, remains in a diagnostic limbo, acknowledged predominantly as a subtype of schizophrenia. Yet, catatonia is present in about 10% of acutely ill psychiatry patients, only a minority of whom have schizophrenia. Among those with comorbid affective disorders, who comprise the largest subgroup of catatonic patients, the catatonic signs typically resolve dramatically and completely with benzodiazepine therapy. Those with schizophrenia respond less reliably, suggesting that the underlying processes causing the catatonia may be different in this group. The majority of patients with catatonia have concurrent psychosis. Failure to treat the catatonia before institution of antipsychotic medication may increase the risk of inducing neuroleptic malignant syndrome. At this point of time, the pathobiology of catatonia is unknown; the major reason for considering catatonia as a separate diagnostic entity would be to increase recognition of this eminently treatable neuropsychiatric syndrome."}, {"Title": "Post-soviet placebos: epistemology and authority in Russian treatments for alcoholism.", "Abstract": "The dominant modalities of treatment for alcoholism in Russia are suggestion-based methods developed by narcology-the subspecialty of Russian psychiatry which deals with addiction. A particularly popular method is the use of disulfiram-an alcohol antagonist-for which narcologists commonly substitute neutral substances. Drawing on 14 months of fieldwork at narcological clinics in St. Petersburg, this article examines the epistemological and institutional conditions which facilitate this practice of \"placebo therapy.\" I argue that narcologists' embrace of such treatments has been shaped by a clinical style of reasoning specific to a Soviet and post-Soviet psychiatry, itself the product of contested Soviet politics over the knowledge of the mind and brain. This style of reasoning has facilitated narcologists' understanding of disulfiram as a behavioral, rather than a pharmacological, treatment and has disposed them to amplify patients' responses through attention to the performative aspects of the clinical encounter and through management of the treatment's broader reputation as an effective therapy. Moreover, such therapies have generally depended upon, and helped to reinforce, clinical encounters premised on a steeply hierarchical physician-patient relationship."}, {"Title": "Theory and method at the intersection of anthropology and cultural neuroscience.", "Abstract": "Anthropologists have become increasingly interested in embodiment-that is, the ways that socio-cultural factors influence the form, behavior and subjective experience of human bodies. At the same time, social cognitive neuroscience has begun to reveal the mechanisms of embodiment by investigating the neural underpinnings and consequences of social experience. Despite this overlap, the two fields have barely engaged one another. We suggest three interconnected domains of inquiry in which the intersection of neuroscience and anthropology can productively inform our understanding of the relationship between human brains and their socio-cultural contexts. These are: the social construction of emotion, cultural psychiatry, and the embodiment of ritual. We build on both current research findings in cultural neuroscience and ethnographic data on cultural differences in thought and behavior, to generate novel, ecologically informed hypotheses for future study. In addition, we lay out a specific suggestion for operationalizing insights from anthropology in the context of cultural neuroscience research. Specifically, we advocate the development of field studies that use portable measurement technologies to connect individual patterns of biological response with socio-cultural processes. We illustrate the potential of such an approach with data from a study of psychophysiology and religious devotion in Northeastern Brazil."}, {"Title": "Excessive daytime sleepiness in psychiatric disorders: Prevalence, correlates and clinical significance.", "Abstract": "This study examined the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness, as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), in a cohort of adult psychiatric patients. A total of 300 psychiatric outpatients and an additional 300 healthy controls completed the ESS. Excessive sleepiness was defined by a score of > or =10. The prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness was higher in the psychiatric group (34%) than the control group (27%), and the mean ESS score was also significantly higher in the psychiatric group. The prevalence of excessive sleepiness was higher for female psychiatric patients, but this pattern was not found in the control group. Surprisingly, there was no difference in ESS score between patients taking antipsychotic medication and those not taking antipsychotic medication. The data suggest that excessive daytime sleepiness is a significant issue in general adult psychiatry, but this must be interpreted against a relatively high prevalence in the normal population."}, {"Title": "Barriers to treatment seeking for anxiety disorders: initial data on the role of mental health literacy.", "Abstract": "Anxiety disorders represent the single largest mental health problem in the United States [Greenberg et al., 1999.

Specifically, respondents were presented with vignettes portraying individuals experiencing various forms of mental illness and were asked to label the disorder, its cause and whether or not they would recommend treatment.\nFindings showed that social phobia and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) were associated with recognition rates that were generally high and similar to depression (approximately 80%). In contrast, less than half of the respondents labeled panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) correctly. Symptoms of OCD were attributed to mental illness by approximately 50% of respondents, but such attributions were rare for the other anxiety disorders studied (<12%). Finally, data on help-seeking recommendations suggested that such recommendations are far from universal and varied between different anxiety disorders and according to perceptions of the causes of symptoms.\nGiven that the current sample was well-educated young adults, mental health literacy of the general public may be even lower."}, {"Title": "Community Systems of Care for Children's Mental Health.", "Abstract": "Although the future of the systems of care model continues to evolve, the core values of child psychiatry are well supported and well served in this emerging arena of public children's mental health service delivery.

Psychiatrists traditionally have been involved in assessing, diagnosing, and treating the severely mentally ill or consulting with school-based providers. With no end in sight to the dearth of child and adolescent psychiatrists, not to mention child and adolescent behavioral health providers in other disciplines, this role has been broadened in recent years by several programs in which the child and adolescent psychiatrist provides flexible, population-based, systemic, and context-specific approaches to working in schools. In this article, the authors first review some of the traditional roles for child and adolescent psychiatrists working in school mental health settings. Then 2 national programs are highlighted, which successfully integrate psychiatrist trainees into comprehensive school mental health programs. The theoretical approach to a specific community-oriented, strengths-based model for school mental health support used in New Mexico by the University of New Mexico (UNM) Psychiatry Department's Center for Rural and Community Behavioral Health school telepsychiatry program, which supports rural and frontier school mental health programs and school-based health centers, is discussed in detail. The UNM model involves a strength-and resiliency-based collaboration between the child and adolescent psychiatrist, students, families, educators, and those who support them. The psychiatrist co-creates a \"community of concern\" and support for students, including not only customary participants such as parents, educators, and health care providers but also peers, families of choice, lay professionals, community gatekeepers, and others identified by the student as critical to his or her well-being.

There are substantial negative consequences including suicide. Suicide occurs during depression so the recognition of depression is the critical first step to preventing suicide. Recently noted is that one barrier to recognition is the traditional, comprehensive, psychiatric interview taught in academic departments of psychiatry that is impractical in primary care settings because it takes too much time. Some brief, initial psychiatric techniques have been developed but these typically have been introduced in primary care training programs and not by departments of psychiatry.\nA verbal four-question, 90 s screen for depression may be acceptable for routine use in primary care because it typically requires only seconds to a few minutes.

First we discuss the question of whether there is and has been such an impact. The answer is yes: different conceptions of free will have inspired different systems of law and forensic psychiatry, as becomes clear when looking at the accountability doctrine as compared to the unique Swedish system rejecting this doctrine. However, there is no necessary connection between doctrines of responsibility and conceptions of free will, since the former primarily says something about when someone should be held responsible and the latter says something about when someone really is free in a sense relevant to responsibility. This leads to the second question: should conceptions of free will have an impact on law and forensic psychiatry? We argue: that they should not, given the implausibility the normative theory retributivism, which posits a direct connection between free will and punishment. More importantly, questions of free will are complicated and unresolved philosophical issues that are better left out of the everyday decision-making incumbent on the legal and psychiatric systems. Instead, we recommend using an empirically useful and gradual conception of autonomy to facilitate the determination of legal responsibility. This autonomy conception, being neutral on the question of free will, eliminates the need to take a stand on it."}, {"Title": "Social disability in schizophrenic, schizoaffective and affective disorders 15 years after first admission.", "Abstract": "Interest in social functioning of people suffering from mental illnesses has been increasing over the last few years. Only few studies have investigated differences in social functioning in affective, schizoaffective and schizophrenic patients in the long-term and in a comparative approach.\nThe present study is part of a 15 year follow-up study on patients suffering from severe mental illness. The here reported findings refer to the data of a sample of 177 patients with life-time diagnoses belonging to the schizophrenic, schizoaffective or affective spectrum according to the ICD-10 criteria. Psychopathological, socio-demographic and other illness-related variables were assessed at the index hospitalisation and at the 15 year follow-up evaluation by using the assessment system published by the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry (AMDP-system). Information about patients' social disability was assessed by using a modified and further developed version of the WHO disability assessment scale, the (Mannheim) Disability Assessment Schedule (DAS-M scale). Prevalence rates of social disability and differences in the severity of social disability between different groups of mental illnesses were evaluated. And the association between social disability, diagnoses and psychopathology was analysed.\nCompared to affective and schizoaffective patients, schizophrenic patients showed significantly higher levels of social disability in almost all domains. Severe to very severe levels of disability were found in 64% of schizophrenic patients and only in 19% of schizoaffective patients and 5% of affective patients. However, on a descriptive level all three diagnostic groups presented with similar maxima and minima in their profiles of social disability. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the apathy syndrome had the highest impact on the presence of severe social disability with all other psychopathological syndromes, gender, age and diagnosis having no statistically significant influence.\nFindings indicate that patients' disabilities in different diagnostic groups seem to be of a similar quality and nature despite differences in their severity.

Neurotransmitters are released at neuronal endings, diffuse rapidly across the synaptic cleft, and then act upon receptor proteins embedded in the membrane of the post-synaptic neuron or gland. Drugs are evaluated for their ability to stimulate or to block specific receptors, and in that way modify activity of the postsynaptic organ in order to achieve some desirable therapeutic effect. This chapter is concerned with our knowledge of some of the principal neurotransmitters, namely the primary amines: dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin; the quaternary amine: acetylcholine; and the aminoacids: gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamic acid and glycine.

In Italy, as elsewhere in Europe, the concepts of humoral pathology were abandoned in the 18th century, when neurology was influenced by novel trends. Neurology acquired the status of clinical discipline (as \"clinic of mental diseases\") after national reunification (declared in 1861 but completed much later). At the end of the 19th and first decades of the 20th century, eminent Italian \"neuropsychiatrists\" (including, among many others, Ugo Cerletti, who introduced electroconvulsive shock therapy in 1938) stimulated novel knowledge and approaches, \"centers of excellence\" flourished, and \"Neurological Institutes\" were founded. In the first half of the 20th century, the history of Italian neurology was dominated by World Wars I and II (which stimulated studies on the wounded) and the fascist regime in-between the Wars (when the flow of information was instead very limited).

Animists like Stahl in the 18th century saw the soul as the cause of health and disease, and the later Vitalists insisted on life-force as the specific property of living beings, contrary to skeptics like Albrecht von Haller, whose neurophysiology they left behind. Following Willis, they studied brain tracts and speculated about reflex action. They experimented with electrotherapy, and later devised early theories of electric nerve action. The controversial medical theories of animal magnetism and phrenology also advanced brain research and clinical neurology together with their sectarian programs, which seem absurd today. The impact on natural science and medicine of the last great Vitalist, Johannes M\u00fcller, and his mechanistic students such as Remak, Schwann, Schleiden, Helmholtz, Ludwig, Br\u00fccke, Virchow, Koelliker, and Wundt was unparalleled. They provided the anatomical and physiological infrastructure for the growth of neurology. From 1845 far into the 20th century, psychiatry and neurology evolved together. Neuropsychiatrists cared for their mental patients during the day, and studied their brain tissue slides at night, as in the case of Alzheimer and Nissl.

The methods were in concordance with medical practice in the rest of Europe. Scandinavian neurobiologists have produced important contributions to neuroscience during the last 300 or 400 years. Their names can be recognized as eponyms and Nobel prize laureates. Examples are Niels Stensen (Nicolaus Stenoni), the Bartholin family and Knud Krabbe of Denmark, Ragnar Granit of Finland, Bj\u00f8rn Sigurdsson (the concept of slow virus infections) of Iceland, Asbj\u00f8rn F\u00f8lling and Sigvald Refsum of Norway and Gunnar Wohlfart, Eric Kugelberg, Lisa Welander and Arvid Carlsson of Sweden. In addition, well known neurological diseases were described in Scandinavia long before those neuroscientists that today have their names attached to them: Otto Christian Stengel, Norway (1826: Batten-Spielmayer-Vogt's disease), Johan Christian Lund, Norway (1860: Huntington's chorea) and Ernst Alexander Hom\u00e9n, Finland (1889: Wilson's disease)."}, {"Title": "Chapter 40: history of neurology in France.", "Abstract": "The history of neurology in France is characterized by the very high degree of centralization in that country where \"everything seems to happen in Paris,\" and yet the considerable degree of autonomous diversity in the evolution of some other medical schools such as Montpellier and Strasbourg. It could be argued that France saw the birth of clinical neurology as a separate discipline since Jean Martin Charcot at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital obtained a chair of diseases of the nervous system in 1892, a first in the history of the academic world. The chapter shows, however, that the work of Charcot was preceded by a long evolution in medical thinking, which culminated with the introduction of experimental medicine developed by Claude Bernard and Fran\u00e7ois Magendie, and by the study of aphasia by Paul Broca and its localization of language in a specific area of the brain. Many of the great neurologists of France like Duchenne de Boulogne, Gilles de la Tourette, Joseph Babinski and Pierre Marie gravitated around Charcot while others like Charles-Edward Brown-Sequard and Jules Dejerine developed their talents independently. The history of Sainte-Anne Hospital further illustrates this independence. It also shows the relation between neurology and psychiatry with Henri Ey, Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker, who collaborated with Henri Laborit in the clinical development of chlorpromazine. Sainte Anne also saw the birth of modern neuropsychology with Henry H\u00e9caen. Jean Talairach and his group developed human stereotaxic neurosurgery and a 3-dimensional brain atlas that is used around the world. The chapter also mentions institutions (the CNRS and INSERM) that have contributed to developments partially independently from medical schools. It concludes with a presentation of schools located outside of Paris that have played a significant role in the development of neurology. Six of the most important ones are described: Montpellier, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, Lyon, and Marseilles."}, {"Title": "Chapter 39: an historical overview of British neurology.", "Abstract": "In the UK, neurology stemmed from general (internal) medicine rather than psychiatry. In 1886 the Neurological Society of London was founded, with Hughlings Jackson as its first President. After World War I, Kinnier Wilson was made Physician in Charge of the first independent department of neurology, which was at Westminster Hospital in London. Although before the 17th century there were British doctors who took an interest in diseases of the nervous system, e.g. Gilbertus Anglicus (c. 1230), who distinguished epilepsy from apoplexy, and Bartholomeus Anglicus, whose encyclopedia (c. 1260) provided the first picture of a dissection printed in English, John of Gaddesden (1280-1361) was the first in Britain to produce a manuscript on neurological disorders. Thomas Willis (1621-1675) was the founder of Neurology, being the first to use the term, and was also the leader of the first multidisciplinary team in neurological science, helping to shift attention from the chambers of the brain to the brain substance itself. He wrote seven books, all but the last in Latin, and his second one, Cerebri anatome (1664) was the first on the nervous system to include the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves, introducing such new terms as lentiform body, corpus striatum, optic thalamus, inferior olives and peduncles. Most of his neurology was in his fifth book, De anima brutorum (1672). Before Willis the brain was a mystery, but his work laid the foundations for neurological advances. After the 17th century of William Harvey and Thomas Sydenham and the 18th century of William Heberden and Robert Whytt there followed the 19th century of James Parkinson (1755-1824), John Cooke (1756-1838), Sir Charles Bell (1774-1842), Marshall Hall (1790-1856) and Bentley Todd (1809-1860). Besides its \"Father,\" Hughlings Jackson, the giants who established the unique superiority of British neurology were Sir William Gowers, Sir David Ferrier, Kinnier Wilson, Sir Gordon Holmes and Sir Charles Sherrington."}, {"Title": "[Case payments in hospital psychiatry in the USA. The Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Prospective Payment System (IPF PPS)].", "Abstract": "In Germany the introduction of a prospective payment system (PPS) is intended for inpatients hospitalised in psychiatric facilities. We investigate the various elements of the Prospective Payment System for Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities (IFP PPS) which was established in the USA in 2005 with respect to their potential to be incorporated into a german PPS.\nThe most important elements of IFP PPS (impact of diagnosis, comorbidity, patient age, per diem adjustment for length of stay, various other adjustment factors like facility characteristics and geographical factors) are presented. The IFP PPS was especially designed for the requirements of psychiatric inpatient facilities in the USA. Complexity of the individual elements of the PPS appears to be manageable. However, various elements, e. g. the facility based adjustments including wage index or rural location and cost of living adjustments will not be applicable to countries other than the US. The 15 diagnosis related groups of the IFP PPS system refer to ICD-9 which is less differentiated than the ICD-10 which is in use in Germany, thus these psychiatric DRG will not be compatible under conditions of a german PPS. The per diem adjustment for length of stay is the predominating element of the IFP PPS, relation to effort/performance is insufficiently represented.\nSome elements of the IFP PPS may be applicable to a german prospective payment system for psychiatric inpatient facilities, especially with respect to the rules for per diem adjustment for length of stay and for handling of cases with frequent discharge and readmission of patients. Altogether a stronger representation of elements of performance of inpatient facilities seems to be desirable."}, {"Title": "Brief report: driving hazard perception in autism.", "Abstract": "This study investigated whether individuals with ASD (autistic spectrum disorders) are able to identify driving hazards, given their difficulties processing social information, Klin et al.

In half of the clips the source of the hazard was a visible person (social); in the other half the source was a car (non-social). Participants with ASD identified fewer social hazards than the comparison participants (U = 163.00, N = 44, p < .05) but not non-social. Participants with ASD were also slower to respond than comparison participants, F(1,40) = 4.93, p < .05.

The QOL concept is culture-dependent, which means that the results of Western studies may not be applicable to Chinese patients. The aim of this study is to summarize the recent literature on QOL and mental health in Chinese culture.\nQOL has increasingly been used as an outcome measure of pharmacotherapeutic or psychosocial interventions in Chinese societies. Recent studies have suggested that socio-cultural factors exert an influence on the QOL of Chinese psychiatric patients. Patients with major psychiatric disorders have a poorer QOL than the general population. Socio-demographic characteristics have no, or only weak, associations with QOL in schizophrenia, whereas novel antipsychotics and antidepressants improve QOL relative to traditional psychotropic medications in the short term.\nThe inclusion of QOL measures in routine clinical practice and research in Chinese societies should be encouraged, and culture-sensitive QOL measures should be developed.

Three major themes emerged from the data: (1) Characteristics of evidence, including the lack of (use of) evidence and the applicability of evidence; (2) Characteristics of other partners in mental health care, including government, patients and drug companies and (3) Discipline-related barriers, including the complexity of diagnoses, the importance of the therapeutic relationship and personal experience, and the different schools of thoughts.

This especially concerns the licensing of a new compound, but apart from this special case, lots of efficacy questions need to be answered in clinical psychopharmacology, such as, e.g. the question of the efficacy of a combination therapy. The methodology of the scientific proof of efficacy has already had a long tradition and has been developed further in the recent past under different aspects. Especially the double-blind randomised parallel group comparison has been developed as a design of highest methodological standard. However, often designs have their place and justification under certain conditions and in relation to certain questions. Although in the recent past, with the over-emphasis of so-called effectiveness studies, the inherent methodological limitations of these studies have not been addressed properly (M\u00f6ller in Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci 258:257-270, 2008), which in consequence devaluated the scientific merits of the classical double-blind randomised control group study designs in the view of those colleagues, who are not that experienced in study design issues.

The duration of the episode as well as demographic and clinical information on the restrained and secluded patient were also reported.\nAgitation/disorientation was the most frequent reason for the use of restraint and seclusion. The duration of the restraint and seclusion episodes was not determined by the reason for using these measures.

The quality of technical care is often taken for granted by older patients, and good or bad experiences are described more in terms of relational aspects of care. Older patients in hospital may feel worthless, fearful or not in control of what happens, especially if they have impaired cognition, or communication difficulties. Three key features of care consistently mediated these negative feelings and were linked to more positive experiences: \"creating communities: connect with me\", \"maintaining identity: see who I am\" and \"sharing decision-making: include me\".\nThese findings highlight the perspectives of older people and their relatives on the delivery of personalized and dignified care in acute settings.

In general this is a meaningful development, which principally will have a positive impact on routine health care in psychiatry. But several related problems should not be ignored. So far consensus on an internationally accepted evidence graduation could not be reached due to several difficulties related to this. For example, focussing on the results of meta-analyses instead of considering relevant single studies results in a decision-making logic which is in conflict with the rationale applied by drug authorities in the licensing process. Another example is the relevance of placebo-controlled trials: if randomized placebo-controlled phase-III studies are prioritized in the evidence grading, the evidence possibly deviates too far from the conditions of routine clinical care due to the special selection of patients in those studies. However, a grading primarily based on active comparator trials could lead to wrong conclusions about efficacy. This concerns especially the so-called \"effectiveness\" studies and other forms of phase-IV studies with their less restrictive methodological rigidity. Attempts to regulate psychopharmacotherapy in the sense of evidence-based medicine come closer to their limits the more complex the clinical situation and the respective decision-making logic are. Even in times of evidence-based medicine a large part of complex clinical decision-making in psychopharmacotherapy still relies more on clinical experience and a consensus on clinical experience, traditions and belief systems than on results of efficacy oriented phase-III and effectiveness-oriented phase-IV clinical studies."}, {"Title": "Diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Neuropsychiatry is the subspecialty of psychiatry that deals with disorders at the intersection of neurology and psychiatry.

These have varied from various medical scandals and funding changes to political imperatives and public expectations. Changes in the knowledge base have added yet another dimension to this debate.\nThe subject is explored using historical figures and their writings and an overview of historic views on the psychiatry profession.\nThe demise of the psychiatrist as an expert and the profession of psychiatry as an expertise can be related to both real and perceived factors. Unlike, for instance, the language used by cardio-thoracic surgeons, the language used in and for professional communications in psychiatry has become very similar to that used in lay discourses on psychological and relationship matters in the general population--partly as a result of the Freudian project successfully insinuating itself into 'common knowledge' and partly as the influence of media grows across the globe. This language has been misappropriated by a wide variety of non-experts, who then speak and interpret it as if they are specialists and any challenge from professionals is seen as self-protection and heresy. As psychiatrists, we do not use technology in a persuasive way as other branches of medicine tend to and this takes away a powerful symbolic conveying 'expertise'. Increased consumerism adds yet another dimension to this discourse.\nThe patient is definitely the expert on how their illness affects their life, but it is the psychiatrist who is the expert on the illness rather than simply focusing on disease.

Specifically, the predictive utility of proactive and reactive peer-directed relational aggression, as well as romantic relational aggression, are explored in a large (N=1387) study of adults. The measure had adequate reliability and validity and the subscales demonstrated unique predictive abilities for a number of dependent variables. In particular, reactive but not proactive relational aggression was uniquely associated with history of abuse, hostile attribution biases, and feelings of distress regarding relational provocation situations. Reactive relational aggression was also more strongly related to anger and hostility than proactive aggression. In addition, relational aggression in the context of romantic relationships was uniquely related to anger, hostility, impulsivity, history of abuse, hostile attribution biases, and emotional sensitivity to relational provocations, even when controlling for peer-directed relational aggression. Gender differences in overall levels of relational aggression were not observed; however, males were most likely to engage in peer-directed proactive and reactive relational aggression whereas females were most likely to engage in romantic relational aggression. In a second study (N=150), relational aggression was higher in a sample of adults with Intermittent Explosive Disorder than in a sample of healthy controls or psychiatric controls.

The state had relied on the expedient of subsidizing the impoverished at the private Hartford Retreat for the Insane that overtaxed that institution and left hundreds untreated. Despite abundant evidence to the contrary, well meaning officials oversold the idea that the Middletown site would promote cures and be cost effective. A number of unanticipated consequences occurred that mirrored fundamental changes in nineteenth-century psychiatry. The new hospital swelled by 1900 to over 2,000 patients, the largest in New England. Custodianship at the monolithic hospital became the norm. The hegemony of monopoly capitalism legitimated the ruling idea that bigger institutions were better and was midwife to the birth of eugenic responses. Class based psychiatry--the few rich at the Retreat and the many poor at Middletown--was standard as it was in other aspects of the Gilded Age. Public policy toward the insane poor in Connecticut represents an outstanding example of the transition from antebellum romanticism to fin de si\u00e8cle fatalism."}, {"Title": "Health assets: a concept analysis.", "Abstract": "Traditionally, nursing care has focused primarily on patients' problems and to solve these problems on behalf of the patient. However, with the growing focus in health care on patient-centered care, self-management of illness, and patient empowerment, the problem-oriented approach to nursing care is no longer sufficient. Assessing and strengthening patients' health assets has evolved into a complementary approach to problem-focused care, helping patients achieve and maintain their health and wellness. This requires a clear definition of the concept of health assets and a better understanding of their role in overall health and wellness. The purpose of this paper was to examine the concept of health assets, including its attributes, associated concepts, and application in a health care context.\nWe systematically reviewed 60 journal articles and Web documents dated from 1966 through March 2007. Data were then analyzed using Rodger's evolutionary method of concept analysis.\nThe health assets concept has not been widely used in health care. However, use has increased during recent years within multiple disciplines, including psychology, psychiatry, nursing, medicine, social sciences, and public health. This concept analysis identified core attributes of health assets to be potentials in the individuals' possession. The core attributes embraces relational, motivational, protective, and volitional strengths, which are internal; and support, expectations of others, and physical and environmental elements, which are external. The antecedents of health assets are genes, values, beliefs, and life experiences. Health assets mobilize an individual to engage in deliberation, decision making, and change. Consequences of health assets are positive health behaviors that can lead to mastery, self-actualization, and improved health outcomes. We propose both a definition of health assets and a descriptive model of its components and relationships.\nFocusing nursing care on a person's health assets, as a complement to the traditional approach of addressing a person's health problems, may contribute to improved health behavior and outcomes. Health assets should, therefore, receive greater attention in nursing practice, education, and research."}, {"Title": "What have the genomics ever done for the psychoses?", "Abstract": "Despite the substantial heritability of the psychoses and their genuine public health burden, the applicability of the genomic approach in psychiatry has been strongly questioned or prematurely dismissed.\nselective review of the recent literature on molecular genetic and genomic approaches to the psychoses including the early output from genome-wide association studies and the genomic analysis of DNA structural variation.\nSusceptibility variants at strong candidate genes have been identified including neuregulin, dysbindin, DISC1 and neurexin 1.

We thus aimed to compare the outcome of delirium treatment in a large, university-affiliated general hospital.\nWe used retrospective medical charts analysis over a one-year period. Those included were all patients who had been admitted to an acute internal medicine ward for delirium or who had developed delirium during their hospital stay.\n191 patients' records were analysed. Mean age for the group was 78.8 +/- 1.1 years. There were 108 males (56.5%) and 83 (43.5%) female patients. The most frequent co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis was that of dementia (106; 56%). The most common physical conditions were: cardiovascular (75 patients) and sepsis (24 patients). Patients suffering from delirium were mostly treated with an antipsychotic: 147 (77%) were treated either with risperidone (73 patients) or classical antipsychotics (74 patients). The most frequently used classical antipsychotic was haloperidol (59/74). Mean risperidone dose was 1.7 +/- 0.4 mg/daily. Mean haloperidol dose was 7.8 +/- 1.9 mg/daily. Mean duration of antipsychotic treatment was 3.8 days for the classical antipsychotics group and 2.6 for the risperidone group (p = 0.04). In the untreated group, mean delirium episodes lasted 5.6 days - significantly longer than that of either treated groups, p = 0.02.Mean hospital stay (days) for the group was 12.8 +/- 1.4.

Questionnaires were sent to a total of 350 general hospital psychiatric clinics throughout Germany and 131 responded by the specified deadline (19 July 2006). In our study, persons of immigrant origin comprised 17% of patients in the responding facilities, which confirmed the results of the pilot study in 2004 of 17.4%. This indicates that the percentage of inpatient psychiatric services used by patients of immigrant origin is almost proportionate to these patients' percentage of the general population (18.6%, Microcensus 2005). In this main study patients of immigrant origin were significantly more likely to receive an ICD-10 F2 diagnosis, and it was precisely patients with this diagnosis who were observed to experience difficulties in communication with caregivers. With reference to the F2 diagnoses there were no noticeable differences between first generation of inpatients with migration history and second generation of inpatients with migration history. There were however more first generation of inpatients with migration history diagnosed with affective disorders whereas more second generation of inpatients with migration history were diagnosed with personality and behavioural disorders. Such differences were not found in the group of patients without immigrant origin.

We explored whether feedback effectiveness improved when teachers' self-assessment was added to written feedback based on student ratings. 37 physicians (10 residents, 27 attending physicians) from different specialties (Internal Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Pediatrics, Neurology, Dermatology, Ophthalmology, ENT, and Psychiatry) were invited to fill out a self-assessment questionnaire on their teaching skills. Students completed an almost identical questionnaire to evaluate the same teachers based on their experiences during clerkships. After receiving written feedback incorporating their self-assessment and the student ratings, the teachers indicated their perceptions of the self-assessment exercise and the written feedback in a questionnaire (five-point Likert scale items) and next, in more detail, in semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 12 of the participating teachers. 25 physicians participated (67%). The results showed that self-assessment and student feedback were both perceived as useful (3.7, SD 1.0) but the latter was considered more effective. The physicians we interviewed considered the combination of self-assessment with student ratings more effective than either self-assessment or written feedback alone. Notably, discrepancies between student ratings and self-assessment were deemed a strong incentive for change. We conclude that self-assessment can be a useful tool to stimulate improvement of clinical teaching when it is combined with written feedback based on student ratings. Future research among larger groups is needed to confirm our findings and examine whether these combined tools actually lead to improved teaching."}, {"Title": "Brief intervention in substance-use among adolescent psychiatric patients: a randomized controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of a brief motivational enhancement intervention in adolescents referred to psychiatric treatment who reported substance-use.

Risk factors associated with depression include medical and psychosocial factors. While in Israel, the rate and risk factors for depression are considered similar to those in other Western countries, population-based data are limited. The present study aims to estimate the prevalence of depression among Jews and Muslim Arabs, and to consider possible associations with demographic, socioeconomic, and health factors.\nThe study group (N\u00a0=\u00a0872) was equally divided according to ethnicity, gender, and age group. Depression was measured by the Harvard Department of Psychiatry National Depression Screening Day Scale (HANDS).\nThe rate of depression scores in the likely/very likely range was 2.5 times higher among Arabs than among Jews (24.9 vs. 10.6%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Women were more likely to express symptoms of depressive episode than were men (22.0 vs. 13.6%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and the depression rate increased with age, from 11.0% in the youngest group (26-35) to 25.0% in the oldest (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The rate of increase in depression by age was different for the genders, rising more steeply for women than for men. However, the age-gender differential was not identical for the two ethnic groups. The differences in depression prevalence between Arabs and Jews were maintained after controlling for confounding variables, except that when controlling for education, the difference between the ethnic groups was no longer significant. After adjusting for all variables in the analysis, no significant association remained between ethnicity and depression (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.80; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.45-1.40)."}, {"Title": "[Gottfried Benn and schizoidism].", "Abstract": "Based on increasing criticism concerning operational diagnostics in psychiatry, the concept of schizoid personality disorder in ICD and DSM is discussed critically.

The identified mutation was located at the conserved position -48 from the transcription start site, and was shown to be of functional effect, resulting in the aberrant expression of the gene. Following screening of the gene in 60 independent cases of schizoaffective disorder, we report novel germ-line mutations at positions -205 C > T and the conserved exon 5 (c: 682 C > T, pro228ser) in two unrelated cases of schizoaffective disorder. These mutations were disease-specific, and as for the -48 G > C mutation, neither was detected in a control population of 370 individuals, indicating a contribution of 3.17% in this sample series.

It is estimated that between 220,000 and 269,500 individuals with schizophrenia were sterilized or killed. This total represents between 73% and 100% of all individuals with schizophrenia living in Germany between 1939 and 1945. Postwar studies of the prevalence of schizophrenia in Germany reported low rates, as expected. However, postwar rates of the incidence of schizophrenia in Germany were unexpectedly high. The Nazi genocide of psychiatric patients was the greatest criminal act in the history of psychiatry.

Current categorization of diagnosis in psychiatry poorly applies to the protean manifestations of mood disorders presented by parkinsonian patients. In this study we have chosen to dissect the state of depressive mood as assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at different points in time of pharmacological interventions using a dimensional approach. The 21 items of the BDI were classified in two new categories or factors: hyperkinetic and hypokinetic. The hyperkinetic factor included all items related to unbalanced intrusions of negative feelings and ideas, as well as to behavioral hyperactivity. The hypokinetic factor included all items related to loss of drive for appetitive behaviors and loss of mental and physical energy. The objectives were to (1) compare different pharmacological treatments on the two-factor approach in PD depression, (2) determine the influence of levodopa therapy on the two-factor approach, and (3) explore the two-factor approach in placebo conditions. Three sets of analyses using the hypo/hyperkinetic dichotomy favour a neurobiological dissociation of these factors in response to pharmacological intervention: symptoms of the hyperkinetic factor are responsive to serotonergic drugs while those of the hypokinetic one are not and may even show deterioration under SSRIs. In contrast, the hypokinetic factor is responsive to dopaminergic drugs and may show deterioration under serotonergic drugs. Furthermore, the two factors seem to transiently dissociate on placebo intervention aiming at correcting either mood or motor status. The dimensional approach to depression symptomatology may thus be of heuristic value in probing aminergic modulation of mood in IPD and establishing new correlations between affective and motor symptoms."}, {"Title": "Neurocognitive diagnosis and cut-off scores of the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP-S).", "Abstract": "To demonstrate the ability of the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP-S) to discriminate between cognitively-impaired individuals and those with adequate functioning in a sample of schizophrenic and bipolar patients, as well as in a control group.\nThe SCIP-S, together with a full neuropsychological battery, was administered to three groups: patients with schizophrenia, patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder I, and controls.

This paper evaluates public attitudes towards the complexity of genetic risk prediction in psychiatry involving susceptibility genes, uncertain penetrance and gene-environment interactions on which successful molecular-based mental health interventions will depend. A qualitative approach was taken to enable the exploration of the views of the public. Four structured focus groups were conducted with a total of 36 participants. The majority of participants indicated interest in having a genetic test for susceptibility to major depression, if it was available. Having a family history of mental illness was cited as a major reason. After discussion of perceived positive and negative implications of predictive genetic testing, nine of 24 participants initially interested in having such a test changed their mind. Fear of genetic discrimination and privacy issues predominantly influenced change of attitude. All participants still interested in having a predictive genetic test for risk for depression reported they would only do so through trusted medical professionals. Participants were unanimously against direct-to-consumer genetic testing marketed through the Internet, although some would consider it if there was suitable protection against discrimination.

The questions assessed the presence and intensity of stigmatizing attitudes towards patients with schizophrenia, depression, panic disorder, dementia and drug and alcohol addiction.\nThe study revealed higher levels of stigma towards patients with depression, alcohol and drug addiction in this Sri Lankan sample compared to UK data but attitudes towards schizophrenia were less stigmatized in Sri Lanka. Blaming attitudes were consistently high across diagnoses in the Sri Lankan sample. Sri Lankan medical students displayed more negative attitudes than doctors (P < 0.001). Overall stigma was greatest towards patients with drug addiction, followed by, alcohol addiction, schizophrenia, depression, panic disorder and dementia.\nSri Lankan doctors and undergraduates endorse stigmatizing attitudes towards mental illnesses and are especially prone to see patients as blameworthy. As such attitudes are likely to affect the engagement of patients in treatment and specific interventions that modify negative attitudes towards people with mental illnesses are needed.

One of them is cardiovascular disease leading to increased risk of stroke, thrombosis, pulmonary, embolism, in which hyperactivation of blood platelets is involved. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of the second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, and a typical neuroleptic - haloperidol - on the one step of platelet activation-platelet aggregation induced by collagen in vitro. Blood was collected into buffered sodium citrate (3.8%) and centrifuged to get platelet-rich plasma (PRP). In PRP (2x10(8) platelets/ml) obtained from healthy volunteers that was incubated with antipsychotics (clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, haloperidol; 30 min) aggregation of blood platelets was measured using a Chrono-Log Lumi-aggregometer. Aggregation of platelets was measured after stimulation of platelets with 1 microl of collagen (2 microg/ml).\nClozapine, like haloperidol reduced platelet aggregation induced by collagen (inhibition of platelet aggregation reached about 20%) (P=1x10(-5) and P=0.003, respectively). Risperidone had also a weak antiaggregatory effect (P=0.05). Among tested antipsychotics only olanzapine had no effect on collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation (P>0.05).\nThe obtained results indicate that the difference in action of tested drugs on platelet aggregation may dependent on the various chemical structures of these drugs. Clozapine, risperidone and haloperidol are structurally diverse, and they all significantly reduce platelet aggregability induced by collagen. On the other hand, a close structural analog of clozapine - olanzapine - did not inhibit platelet aggregation. However, mechanism of antipsychotics action on blood platelets is not clear. Moreover, it seems that clozapine, risperidone and haloperidol treatment due to antiaggregatory action may have even some antithrombotic effects."}, {"Title": "Key features of a unique community psychiatry fellowship: the emory university fellowship in community psychiatry/public health.", "Abstract": "The Emory University Fellowship in Community Psychiatry/Public Health is a unique training opportunity whose mission is to train future leaders in the arena of community psychiatry.

In logistic regression, 3 variables were significant predictors of any level of depression on follow-up: baseline depression, baseline anxiety, greater increase in anxiety symptoms during the follow-up period. These 3 variables along with financial strain were significant predictors of clinical depression on follow-up. There were no inter- or intra-racial differences in outcome.\nThe bleak outcome findings among older psychiatric outpatients in Brooklyn were consistent with unfavorable results reported in European studies.

There were no significant differences in explanatory models between patients who received education and those who did not.\nThe results of this study show that during periods of remission, patients can clearly see the relationship between their own illness and that described in others, suggesting that insight is state dependent and may be related to psychopathology with good recovery of insight during periods of remission. These findings also argue for the fact that the current multi-dimensional models of insight which focus on biomedical explanations and treatments are not culturally sensitive.

The aim was to assess the effectiveness of training in patient-centred interviewing on the interview performance of psychiatric residents.\nPsychiatric residents (n=10) each interviewed 12 different anonymized standardized patients (SPs), eight before and another four after training. SPs simulated psychiatric out-patients who attended for a first visit to the psychiatric out-patient clinic. The consultations were videotaped, transcribed and coded with a classification scheme developed for psychiatric consultations from which an interview performance index was derived. An interrupted time-series design and a segmented regression analysis with multilevel analysis explored the performance trend within the series of consultations.\nThe regression model evidenced a horizontal slope at pre- and post-training, with a significant level change. These findings excluded the presence of a practice effect and indicated a significant effect of training. Performance variability between and within residents over the series of consultations increased at post-training.\nThe training improved patient-centred interviewing performance. More post-training exercise time and supervised practice are necessary to establish consistent performance patterns at a higher skill level."}, {"Title": "Crisis intervention and acute psychiatry in Amsterdam, 20 years of change: a historical comparison of consultations in 1983 and 2004-2005.", "Abstract": "There has been a striking increase in the number of compulsory admission proceedings in the Netherlands since 1992, to such an extent that treatment in Amsterdam's psychiatric clinics is in danger of being dominated by coercive treatment. Our aim was to establish a picture of the changes in emergency psychiatry that have contributed to the increase in the number of acute compulsory admissions.\nA cohort (N = 460) of psychiatric emergency consultations with the city crisis service in 1983 was compared with a similar cohort (N = 436) in 2004-2005. The study focused on the following variables: patient characteristics, crisis-service procedures and consultation outcomes.\nCompared with 1983, there are now more services involved in crisis support in the public domain for psychiatric patients. The number of patients referred by the police has risen from 29% to 63%. In 1983, all consultations took place where the patients were located; at present, 60% take place at the crisis service premises. The number of psychotic patients in the cohort has increased from 52.0% and 63.3 %. There has been an increase in the proportion of compulsory admissions and a sharp decrease in the proportion of voluntary admissions from 61% to 28% of all admissions. Overall, the percentage of consultations leading to a psychiatric admission has fallen from 42% to 27%.\nThe front-line outreach service of 1983 has changed into a specialist psychiatric emergency department with a less pronounced outreach component.

Some of these changes persist despite antidepressant treatment. While research in other areas of psychiatry has shown cognitive training techniques to be effective, only one study has evaluated this approach in depression.\nSixteen patients (mean age=33.5years) with a lifetime diagnosis of major depressive disorder were administered a standardised battery of neuropsychological tests and allocated to treatment (n=8) or waitlist control (n=8) conditions. The treatment consisted of 10-weeks of twice weekly cognitive training using the Neuropsychological Educational Approach to Remediation. All participants were re-assessed after 10-weeks by interviewers blinded to group allocation.\nParticipants in the treatment condition demonstrated greater improvements on tests of memory encoding and memory retention than the waitlist control group. There were no observable benefits in terms of psychomotor speed or executive functions or in self-reported levels of disability. Affective symptoms also remained stable.\nThis study included a small sample of participants and treatment allocation was not randomised.\nCognitive training in affective disorders improves memory performance. It may be an effective non-pharmacological treatment option for improving cognitive functions, which in turn, may improve psychosocial functioning and reduce disability. This study supports theories suggesting cognitive training may promote neuroplasticity."}, {"Title": "[Gait disorders in Parkinson's disease: and pathophysiological approaches].", "Abstract": "Gait disorders and axial symptoms are the main therapeutic challenges in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Gait disorders in PD are characterized by spatial and temporal dysfunction. Gait hypokinesia is the first to appear and is responsible for the decrease in velocity. A good sensitivity to the levodopa is well established. Morris et al. [Morris ME, Iansek R, Matyas TA, Summers JJ. Ability to modulate walking cadence remains intact in Parkinson's disease.

Brain 1996;119:551-68] demonstrated that the ability to modulate walking cadence remains intact in PD, and could correspond to a compensatory mechanism. More advanced disease stages of the disease are characterized by abnormal temporal parameters (such as stride length variability, stride time variability and cadence elevation) which are unresponsive to levodopa therapy and may be correlated with the occurrence of falls and freezing of gait (FOG). Lastly, postural instability also results in falls and is poorly responsive to levodopa. A link between gait impairment and frontal disorders has recently been suggested. After a few years of evolution, paradoxical episodic phenomena are described: festination (\"hastening gait\" with rapid small, short steps) and FOG (involuntary and sudden cessation of gait). Both symptoms are often incapacitating for PD patients, because of their resultant loss of independence and their poor response to levodopa therapy. Kinematical studies of FOG revealed a decrease in velocity, stride length and an exponential increase in cadence, prior to a FOG episode. New approaches (functional MRI, wavelets...) should offer new perspectives concerning these disabling symptoms."}, {"Title": "Abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in psychiatric long-term care patients.", "Abstract": "The objective of the study was to find the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in long-term care patients referred to psychiatry.

We developed a segregated Special Care Unit (SCU) in a somatic hospital for patients with challenging behavior resulting from dementia and/or delirium. This pilot study evaluates the feasibility and patient outcomes.\nThe SCU was established with environmental features that allow for safe and unrestricted ambulation within the unit and create a home-like atmosphere. Daytime activities structure the day and assure additional professional presence. The staff received intensive specialized training. Feasibility criteria were: acceptance by the staff, avoidance of transfers to geriatric psychiatry, lack of serious falls and mortality. Patient outcome criteria were ADL (Barthel index), mobility scores and behavior scores (Wilcoxon's, McNemar tests, pre-post design).\n332 consecutively admitted patients were enrolled. The SCU has been well received by the staff. Length of hospital stay did not differ from other hospital patients (15.3 +/- 8.3 vs. 15.0 +/- 10.3 days, p = 0.54). Six patients were transferred to geriatric psychiatry. Two patients suffered a fall-related hip fracture. The median Barthel Index improved significantly (admission 30, discharge 45, p < 0.001), with only 8.5% of patients suffering functional loss. Wandering, aggression and agitation were significantly reduced (p < 0.001).\nThe SCU has improved the care of patients with challenging behavior.

Historical and current aspects].", "Abstract": "Since its first use in medical literature the meaning of the term autism has constantly changed. An historical overview indicates that in both adult and child psychiatry autism was first used to refer to a symptom of schizophrenia. Later on the use of the term in child psychiatry took a different independent course, which led to present-day conceptualization of autism, mainly due to the work of Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger. Currently autism and autistic disorders are regarded as severe developmental disorders and, due to their stable nature, have gained considerable attention in adult psychiatry. In order to better understand this development, the path from onset to reception is traced via Kanner and Asperger. In the search for central characteristics of autism, one finds restrictions in social communication and interaction, which can be explained by fundamental deficits in social cognition. These restrictions in social cognition can be considered the central characteristic of autism - one which has been a constant since the phenomenon was first described. Our historical review considers to what extent experimental psychopathological research can deepen our understanding of the disorder."}, {"Title": "Excess use of coercive measures in psychiatry among migrants compared with native Danes.", "Abstract": "To investigate differences in risk of compulsory admission and other coercive measures in psychiatric emergencies among refugees and immigrants compared with that among native Danes.\nA register-based retrospective cohort design.

Severity of illness was rated using the brief psychiatry rating scale (BPRS). We evaluated relations between length of stay and clinical and socio-demographic features (linear regression) and possible differences confronting BPRS scores at admission and discharge in the different diagnostic subgroups (ANOVA for repeated measures).\nAll the sample of patients showed a significant improvement in symptomatology during hospitalization. Worse symptomatology in anxiety-depression domain of BPRS at admission in the whole sample was positively correlated with length of stay. A longer length of stay was also shown in patients with diagnosis of depressive disorder. Finally, a different pattern of improvement of BPRS (total score and domains) was shown between the different diagnostic groups.\nBrief hospitalization in our service was shown to be highly effective. Different diagnostic groups had different response to hospitalization, showing faster improvement in characteristic symptomatology, but the anxiety-depression domain showed the highest percentage of change for all the diagnostic groups. We therefore suppose that hospitalization has two effects: a specific (due to tailored therapies) and a non-specific one (due to non-specific therapy and to a placebo-like effect)."}, {"Title": "Treatment of schizoaffective disorder - a challenge for evidence-based psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Schizoaffective disorder is a common diagnosis in mental health services.

However, there are no prior data on regional distribution in the brain of clomipramine and its primary metabolite (desmethylclomipramine) after chronic oral administration. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine in different rat-brain regions and to compare those with levels in plasma and peripheral organs after chronic oral treatment of Sprague Dawley rats (15 mg/kg) for 14 days. The levels of both parent TCA and metabolite were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography in six brain regions (cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum, brainstem and cerebellum), five peripheral organs and in plasma. Our data show that the cerebral cortex had the highest concentration of clomipramine (2.9 microg/mg), with successively lower concentrations in the hypothalamus, striatum, cerebellum, hippocampus and brainstem. Of the peripheral organs, the lungs and liver, had the highest levels of clomipramine, while in the heart, only the metabolite was detected. The plasma concentration (0.17 microg/ml or 0.48 microM) was comparable to that in the hippocampus and cerebellum (approximately 0.20 microg/mg).

Mothers were interviewed with the parent development interview (Aber et al. in The parent development interview.

Representations of clinic-referred mothers were characterized by lower joy, coherence, and richness, and higher anger experienced in the mother-infant relationship compared to controls. During free play, clinic-referred mothers showed lower sensitivity and higher intrusiveness and provided less adequate instrumental and emotional assistance and support during problem solving. Referred children showed lower social engagement during free play. Associations were found among maternal representations, maternal interactive behavior, child social engagement, and the child's ability to self-regulate during a challenging task. These findings provide empirical support for theoretical and clinical perspectives suggesting a reciprocal link between maternal negative representations and mother and child's maladaptive behaviors in the context of early socio-emotional difficulties and mental health referrals."}, {"Title": "The revolving door phenomenon in psychiatry: comparing low-frequency and high-frequency users of psychiatric inpatient services in a developing country.", "Abstract": "Deinstitutionalization has led to a dramatic reduction of inpatient beds and subsequent increase in pressure on available beds.

The objectives of this study are to investigate whether hippocampal volumes are reduced in patients with schizophrenia and those with major depression with the same duration of illness compared to healthy controls and to assess further changes at different disease stages. A total of 319 inpatients and healthy controls were enrolled and investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hippocampal volumes were measured using the segmentation software BRAINS. Bilateral hippocampal volume reductions were detected in both schizophrenic and depressed patients compared to healthy control (HC) subjects. Although younger, schizophrenic (SZ) patients showed in their MRI scans significant bilaterally reduced hippocampal volumes compared to patients with major depression. Although the hippocampal reductions were similar at the onset of symptomatic manifestation of both diseases, there was a further significant reduction of the left hippocampus in the recurrently ill SZ subgroup. The data suggest rather dynamic structural brain alterations in schizophrenia compared to major depression. Here, the presented application of the comparative neuroscience approach, by the use of large neuroimaging MRI databases, seems highly valuable.

Our findings suggest that continuation-maintenance ECT is effective in carefully selected patients at high risk of relapse."}, {"Title": "Adjustment disorders after severe life-events in four postconflict settings.", "Abstract": "The present study explores whether severe life-events are associated with adjustment disorders (AD) by reanalyzing the data of a multisite epidemiological survey (de Jong et al. in Lancet 361:2128-2130, 2003). AD were diagnosed according to the new stress-response-model of AD (Maercker et al. in Psychopathology 40(3):135-146, 2007).\nData from 3048 persons from four different refugee settings in Ethiopia, Algeria, Gaza, and Cambodia were reanalyzed. Life events were assessed by an adapted version of the Life Events and Social History Interview (Mollica et al. in Am J Psychiatry 144:1567-1572, 1987). The current study focuses on non-directly life threatening events related to AD (e.g. loss of property) in contrast to life-threatening events related to Posttraumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD). AD Symptom measures were obtained from available psychopathology assessments: composite international diagnostic interview (WHO in CIDI, Geneva, 1997) and structured interview for disorders of extreme stress (Pelcovitz et al. J Trauma Stress 10:3-16, 1997).\nThe majority of the subjects had experienced one or more AD-related life event. Most common AD-related life events varied across the four sites with bad shelter conditions most prevalent in Ethiopia (100%) and Gaza (32%), forced social isolation in Algeria (61%), and lack of food in Cambodia (41%). Prevalences of AD diagnoses ranged from 6% (Ethiopia) to 40% (Algeria). The highest rates of comorbidity were between AD and PTSD, followed by anxiety disorders.\nThe present study shows that the new concept of AD can be of use for psychiatric epidemiology, e.g., in migration contexts. The high-comorbidity rates could indicate that AD and PTSD are parts of a stress response spectrum."}, {"Title": "Beliefs about God, psychiatric symptoms, and evolutionary psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The present study analyzed the association between specific beliefs about God and psychiatric symptoms among a representative sample of 1,306 U.S. adults. Three pairs of beliefs about God served as the independent variables: Close and Loving, Approving and Forgiving, and Creating and Judging. The dependent variables were measures of General Anxiety, Depression, Obsessive-Compulsion, Paranoid Ideation, Social Anxiety, and Somatization. As hypothesized, the strength of participants' belief in a Close and Loving God had a significant salutary association with overall psychiatric symptomology, and the strength of this association was significantly stronger than that of the other beliefs, which had little association with the psychiatric symptomology. The authors discuss the findings in the context of evolutionary psychiatry, and the relevance of Evolutionary Threat Assessment Systems Theory in research on religious beliefs."}, {"Title": "Rational suicide: philosophical perspectives on schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Suicide prevention is a National Health Service priority in the United Kingdom. People with mental illness are seen to represent one of the most vulnerable groups for suicide and recent British Government policy has focused on prevention and management of perceived risk. This approach to suicide prevention is constructed under a biomedical model of psychiatry, which maintains that suicidal persons suffer from some form of disease or irrational drive towards self-destruction. Many react to the idea of self-inflicted death with instinctive revulsion, which has prevented serious discussion of the concept of rational suicide, particularly in relation to those with schizophrenia. The idea that there may be circumstances in which suicide can be viewed as rational is discussed within the biomedical approach to ethics and wider literature primarily in relation to physical disease, terminal states and chronic pain. It is not deemed a viable choice for those who are considered 'non-autonomous' due to the controlling forces of mental illness. I propose that suicide is not a consequence of mental illness per se, and that it may be seen as a rational response to a realistic perspective on the course and consequences of living with schizophrenia. The denial of dialogue about the validity of suicidal ideation for people with schizophrenia has led to negative consequences for people with serious mental illness in terms of justice and recognition of person-hood."}, {"Title": "Psychiatrists' attitude towards and knowledge of clozapine treatment.", "Abstract": "Clozapine is, in most countries, underutilized and the initiation of clozapine is often delayed. The purpose of this study is to investigate the reasons for the delay and the underutilization of clozapine. One hundred psychiatrists were interviewed by phone. The interview was a structured interview with questions regarding attitude to, knowledge of and experiences with clozapine. Forty-eight (48%) psychiatrists had treatment responsibility of fewer than five patients treated with clozapine and 31 of the interviewed psychiatrists (31%) had started clozapine within the last 3 months. Seven psychiatrists (7%) had never prescribed clozapine despite the fact that they had been working more than five years in general psychiatry. Sixty-four psychiatrists (64%) would rather combine two antipsychotics than use clozapine. Sixty-six psychiatrists (66%) believed that patients treated with clozapine were less satisfied with their treatment when compared with those treated with other atypical antipsychotics. Many psychiatrists are reluctant to use clozapine and this might be due to less experience and knowledge of clozapine. A reason for the low awareness of clozapine's properties might be that clozapine is now a generic drug, and therefore, the marketing and education in using the drug is sparse."}, {"Title": "Schizophrenia and alterations in self-experience: a comparison of 6 perspectives.", "Abstract": "Contemporary researchers have tended to examine dysfunction among the lives of persons with schizophrenia as a matter of the impact of biological and social forces. While this has greatly advanced the knowledge base, any account of schizophrenia without a full consideration of the illness's first-person dimensions risks missing that schizophrenia is a disorder that interrupts the lives of people who must continue to struggle to find and create security and meaning. While literature from a range of sources has explored self-experience in schizophrenia, one barrier to the creation of a larger synthesis and application of this work is that it remains unclear whether, and to what degree, these differing views of self-experience are comparable with one another. To address this issue, this article reviews 6 different accounts of self-experience, a fundamental, first-person dimension of schizophrenia. The 6 are early psychiatry, existential psychiatry, psychoanalysis, phenomenology, psychosocial rehabilitation, and dialogical psychology. After comparing and contrasting the 6, we conclude that there is a wide-ranging, if general consensus, which suggests that many suffering from schizophrenia experience themselves as diminished relative to their former selves, ie, after onset they experience themselves as less able to engage the world effectively, which intensifies their anxieties in the face of everyday interactions. However, within this broad consensus, significant disagreements exist around issues such as whether these difficulties meaningfully predate the illness, how recovery is possible, and if so, under what conditions. In closing, we suggest a program of research to address these disagreements."}]
