This measure may be potentially beneficial for patients. How can prosecution be chosen as an option when faced with violent patients? When this option is considered, how should it be applied and what are the different steps to follow? To answer these questions, it appeared essential to first proceed to a comprehensive reflection on the recourse of sanction in psychiatry. We then describe advantages and disadvantages of the judicial process. Finally, we illustrate applications as they were conceived and elaborated at the Clinique de dangerosit\u00e9 de l'Institut Philippe Pinel de Montr\u00e9al."}, {"Title": "[In the line of sight of court hearings reviewing involuntary confinement: mental state and dangerousness.].", "Abstract": "This article presents results following the observation of six court hearings of the Tribunal administratif du Qu\u00e9bec reviewing involuntary confinement. All 6 hearings concerned individuals considered dangerous. Through thematic analysis of testimonies and interrogations of various people involved (psychiatrist, prosecutor, defence attorney, expert psychiatrist), the author examines signs and points of reference used by those involved to decide on the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient. The results reveal that there is no objective criteria emerging from the hearings and that the way to define the dangerousness of an individual is abstract as well as vague. In fact, it is only in the written decision following hearings one sees the first comments related to dangerousness. The hearing stages psychiatry's and the law's protagonists who discuss among themselves not the issue of dangerousness but rather the implicitness of compulsory treatment the person must share with them. In the written decision, this is what emerges of this discourse which appears to be translated in terms of dangerousness."}, {"Title": "Post-coma paraschizophrenia and quality of life in patients with closed-head injuries.", "Abstract": "Background. Organic brain damage is traditionally an excluding criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis of mental illness. In fact, however, the neurobehavioral disturbances exhibited by many CHI patients, especially those who have been comatose for more than a month, are strikingly similar to the symptoms of Type II schizophrenia. The authors propose to use the term \"post-coma paraschizophrenia\" to describe these disturbances and discuss their negative impact on the quality of life of CHI patients.<br /> Material and methods. The experimental group (Group CHI) consisted of 15 CHI patients, 7 males and 8 females, ranging in age from 17 to 58, treated in the Department of Medical Rehabilitation at the Cracow Rehabilitation Center and the Rehabilitation Clinic at the Bydgoszcz Medical University. All these patients had incurred a closed-head injury resulting in a coma lasting at least one month. He control group (Group SCHI) consisted of 15 patients diagnosed with Type II schizophrenia, matched by age, sex, and level of education to the patients in Group CHI, under treatment in the Psychiatry Department at the Wroclaw Medical University and the Bydgoszcz Medical University. The data reported were based on clinical observation, patient and family interviews, standard neuropsychological tests, the Frontal Behavioral Inventory, and the Quality of Life Scale for Patients with Traumatic Brain Injuries.<br /> Results. Standard neuropsychological tests showed similar dysfunctions in general intelligence and memory, with a tendency in both groups to lower scores in non-verbal parameters. Some interesting qualitative differences in performance are presented. All the CHI patients showed significant signs of frontal syndrome, with a profile resembling fronto-temporal dementia, while the test results from the SCHI patients were more similar to those associated with severe clinical depression. All of the patients in the CHI group exhibited at least some of the symptoms traditionally regarded as indicative of schizophrenia. Positive (formative) symptoms of schizophrenia were found much more often in the patients from Group SCHI, whereas the percentages for the occurrence of particular negative (defective) symptoms are quite similar in both groups.<br /> Conclusions. Patients with closed-head injuries may present with quasi-psychotic symptoms, here termed \"post-coma paraschizophrenia\". Among the most significant common features of the two syndromes are disorganized behavior, apathy, and disturbances of executive functions. Post-coma paraschizophrenia, which mostly remains untreated because of the lack of neuropsychiatric diagnosis, has a significant negative on the quality of life of CHI patients, and should receive further attention in both theoretical research and clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Psychotherapy in the managed care health market.", "Abstract": "The author considers the future of psychotherapy in the managed care health market. He focuses on two interrelated questions. How can the efficacy of psychotherapy be scientifically demonstrated? Can psychotherapy meet the standards of cost-effectiveness set by health plans? He notes that efficacy is not enough in the managed care market, in which health plans also focus on the rational allocation of resources and economies of scale. The author then turns to the question of whether the doctor-patient relationship, which was central to American medicine throughout much of the 20th century, can survive in the current healthcare climate. He reviews the literature on the efficacy of psychotherapy and discusses the criteria for empirically validated treatments proposed by the American Psychological Association. He concludes that there is considerable support for the premise that the personal qualities of the individual therapist that contribute to the formation of the therapeutic alliance are at least as important, if not more important, than the specific method of psychotherapy used. The author concludes that medicine and psychiatry may be neglecting an important and uniquely curative element-the doctor-patient relationship, the human encounter that is the foundation of the art and science of medicine."}, {"Title": "[Cost analysis of psychiatric health care at the University Hospital of Fann (Senegal)].", "Abstract": "In the current senegalese context, marked by a political will of autonomisation of health services, is proves very important to study the costs of the services provided in hospitals.

Twelve questionnaires were returned, yielding a 52% response rate. Overall, there was agreement regarding the general operating characteristics of the clinics. The majority was based on an interdisciplinary team including a physician, a nurse and a social worker. The mean number of new monthly patients attending the clinics was 24 (range 7-70), and the main source of referral was the Sick Funds. Mostly all clinics used the Mini Mental State Examination as a screening instrument and performed psychological, physical, neurological, and laboratory examinations.

St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is a perennial herb that has become a widely used depression therapy. Extracts of hypericum have shown affinity for receptors within multiple neurochemical systems. The primary active substance responsible for the antidepressant effect is not well defined, but most work has concentrated specifically on the hypericin and hyperforin components. Although hypericum has demonstrated significant antidepressant and antianxiety effects in multiple studies, there are several recent studies that do not support the previous evidence. In all reported studies, hypericum extracts have been well tolerated. In addition, new psychiatric uses for hypericum in obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, menopausal symptoms, and alcohol dependence have been reported. Because patients are choosing to pursue CAT as a first-line therapy, psychiatrists will need to have a better understanding of phytomedicines used for treating depression and anxiety, and thus be better prepared to serve as effective allies of their patients."}, {"Title": "The ethics of informed parental consent to psychiatric drugging of children.", "Abstract": "That so many children are taking prescribed psychiatric drugs means that millions of parents have agreed to this recommendation for their children. Most pertinent to this fact is the question whether these parents have been given the opportunity to make their decisions in accordance with the legal standard of informed consent which requires a physician to disclose sufficient information for a patient to make an \"informed\" decision about a proposed treatment. At the least, such legitimate consent entails an opportunity to evaluate knowledgeably the options available and the risks attendant upon each, without coercion. This article examines the ethics of informed consent in psychiatry, and extant practices in the field, especially in regard to the psychiatric drugging of school age children in the United States. The authors argue that informed consent is systematically violated in this domain, and present a look at what authentic informed consent for parents to decide about psychiatric drugs for their children would entail."}, {"Title": "A critique of medical coercive psychiatry, and an invitation to dialogue.", "Abstract": "The medical model is the dominant ideology of psychiatry. It is used to justify involuntary institutionalization, forced drugging, and electroshock. By medical model is meant the medicalization of human thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The medical model is an ideology because it serves the interests of and justifies the public demand for a covert form of social control. Psychiatry, the government, and the pharmaceutical industry have formed a mutually compatible view of human problems and their solutions, a \"gleichschalten\"--a marching in step. In their common view, certain human problems are psychiatric illnesses which, like other medical illnesses, are biological but, unlike other medical illnesses, can be treated with confinement and coercion. This ideology is accepted and adopted by the public without critical examination or self-reflection. Critical examination of the medical model has been systematically repressed by academic and organized psychiatry and their supporters. Recently, however, an increasing number of people are questioning the medical model. They are doubtful about the validity and social utility of explaining an expanding category of human problems caused by errant brain chemistry for which persons bear no responsibility and for which the treatment is pharmaceutical drugs. They are rising in protest against psychiatric repression, oppression and abuse. This essay presents 10 points of criticism of medical coercive psychiatry. It was first presented as the accusation at the Foucault Tribunal in Berlin in 1998. It has been reframed in this essay as an invitation to medical coercive psychiatry to dialogue with its critics."}, {"Title": "Long term neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of perinatal life events in rats.", "Abstract": "Modern neurosciences are now able to open new avenues concerning an experimental approach to clinical neurosciences and psychiatry. Detection and prediction of potential vulnerabilities such as behavioral disturbances and neurodegenerative diseases, are urgent tasks leading to prevention that must be encouraged in parallel to the enormous efforts displayed for treatments. Besides possible genetic origins of diseases, environmental factors are now coming under scrutiny, and especially deleterious and challenging life events and stress occurring during prenatal and postnatal critical periods may orient brain functions towards deleterious developments. The hypothesis that will be examined is that early events might be at the origin of pathological transformations and symptoms after long periods of apparent normal abilities and behavioral homeostasis. We used models of prenatal stress and postnatal manipulations such as cross-fostering. It will be demonstrated that such events induce long-term changes, cognitive and emotional modifications appearing first, when offspring are adults, followed by cognitive defects later in life. Increased sensitivity of the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), the endocrine system controlling the secretion of stress hormones (corticoids), appears to be a major element of pathogenesis. HPA axis dysfunction appears very early after birth (3 days) and lasts for months. Cumulative exposure to high levels of hormones seems to be detrimental for some brain regions, especially the hippocampus and major neurotransmitter systems such as dopamine neurons. We evidenced that neuronal modifications in hippocampal region are correlated with behavioral and cognitive defects, relating environment, stress in early life, hormonal changes, long-term neuropathological processes and impaired cognition in aging. Moreover appears in offspring, when adults, a proneness to engage in drug dependence. These data emphasize the need to consider early environmental life events as etiological factors for delayed neuropsychiatric disturbances, neurodegenerative defects included. Moreover, they strengthen the interest for a longitudinal approach to promote experimental psychopathology."}, {"Title": "The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis in Major Depressive Disorder: A Brief Primer for Primary Care Physicians.", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: One of the most enduring and replicated findings in biological psychiatry is activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in a subset of patients with major depressive disorder. This review will discuss some of these findings and their pertinence to the assessment and treatment of depressed patients. METHOD: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Current Contents databases were searched for pertinent articles on the HPA axis in patients with depression. In addition, hand searches were conducted of references from these sources and abstracts from meetings and books on this topic. Articles that would provide an overview of major or interesting studies in the field were selected for inclusion. RESULTS: The data support that HPA axis activation is common in depressed patients. Frequently reported findings include elevated cortisol and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), nonsuppression on the dexamethasone suppression test, a blunted adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) response to CRH, and hippocampal volume reduction. Evidence of HPA axis activation appears to have prognostic value and is associated with increased risk of depression relapse and even suicide. CONCLUSION: Future research in this area will focus on a better understanding of the etiology and long-term consequences of HPA axis activation in depressed patients. In addition, medications that act on the HPA axis are currently in development and may be part of the psychiatrist's and primary care physician's pharmacopoeia in the near future."}, {"Title": "The Comorbidity of Major Depression and Anxiety Disorders: Recognition and Management in Primary Care.", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depressive and anxiety disorders commonly occur together in patients presenting in the primary care setting. Although recognition of individual depressive and anxiety disorders has increased substantially in the past decade, recognition of comorbidity still lags. The current report reviews the epidemiology, clinical implications, and management of comorbidity in the primary care setting. METHOD: Literature was reviewed by 2 methods: (1) a MEDLINE search (1980-2001) using the key words depression, depressivedisorders, and anxietydisorders; comorbidity was also searched with individual anxiety diagnoses; and (2) direct search of psychiatry, primary care, and internal medicine journals over the past 5 years. RESULTS: Between 10% and 20% of adults in any given 12-month period will visit their primary care physician during an anxiety or depressive disorder episode (although typically for a nonpsychiatric complaint); more than 50% of these patients suffer from a comorbid second depressive or anxiety disorder. The presence of depressive/anxiety comorbidity substantially increases medical utilization and is associated with greater chronicity, slower recovery, increased rates of recurrence, and greater psychosocial disability. Typically, long-term treatment is indicated, although far less research is available to guide treatment decisions. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants are the preferred treatment based on efficacy, safety, and tolerability criteria. Knowledge of their differential clinical and pharmacokinetic profiles can assist in optimizing treatment. CONCLUSION: Increased recognition of the high prevalence and negative psychosocial impact of depression and anxiety disorder comorbidity will lead to more effective treatment. While it is hoped that early and effective intervention will yield long-term benefits, research is needed to confirm this."}, {"Title": "Is physical illness a risk factor for eating disorders in children and adolescents? A preliminary investigation.", "Abstract": "This study investigates the correlation between early-onset eating disorders and past history of physical illness. Subjects for this study were children and adolescents aged between 7 and 19 years, and were divided into two groups: those with anorexia nervosa (n=62) and those with \"other eating disorders\" (n=28). Data on medical history were obtained retrospectively from the patient's files and coded by a consultant psychiatrist. There was no significant difference between the two groups in relation to a history of prior physical illness. However, those with anorexia nervosa were significantly more likely to have suffered more than one serious physical illness prior to the onset of their eating disorder, and both groups were significantly more likely to have had a prior physical illness than an adult control group [Patton, G. C., Wood, K., & Johnson-Sabine. Br. J. Psychiatry 149 (1986) 756.]. Thus, it appears that a past history of physical illness is a significant risk factor for early-onset eating disorders in general, and for anorexia nervosa in particular when there has been more than one physical illness."}, {"Title": "Common to both academia and industry: the challenge of discovery. An interview with Perry Molinoff.", "Abstract": "Perry Molinoff recognizes the distinctions between basic and applied science, between academic and industrial research, and between the preclinical and clinical realities of drug development. But he generally discusses these categories in fluid, practical terms, having throughout his career crossed the lines of distinction that have sometimes been rather heavily drawn among pharmacologists. As a third-year medical student at Harvard, he decided \"to take a year off\" to conduct laboratory research. After receiving his MD and pursuing further clinical and postdoctoral work, he enjoyed an academic career that included fourteen years as the A.N. Richards Professor and Chair of Pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. He has just completed six years as Vice President of Neuroscience and Genitourinary Drug Discovery for Bristol-Myers Squibb and will soon return to teaching, in the Departments of Psychiatry and Pharmacology at Yale University. Referring to himself as either pharmacologist or neuroscientist, depending on context, he has made fundamental discoveries in receptor biology, has overseen the discovery and development of drugs and their subsequent clinical trials, and has mentored a host of pharmacologists and neuroscientists who themselves have established careers in industry and academia. The pursuit of discovery as its own reward emerges as a theme that has marked his professional life (and is perhaps reflected also in the images displayed in his office of the Himalayan mountains, photographed by Molinoff himself from the Everest base camp last year)."}, {"Title": "[Mental diseases described in \"Seririyat-i Akliye Desleri\", a work of Ra\u015fit Tahsin (Tu\u011fsavul)].", "Abstract": "Re\u015fit Tahsin (Tu\u011fsavul) is a well known Turkish psychiatrist.

It is a process whereby the therapist can influence and change the patient's personality. As a result, patients are able to better understand their experiences and behavior and are given a chance to be freed from symptoms. The goal of the present study was to establish the relationship between group psychotherapy and specific symptom clusters, and to follow changes in the personality structure of patients of both genders diagnosed according to ICD-10 classification. The Symptoms Questionnaire and the Personality Factor test were used to determine the severity of symptoms and study personality traits. The study group consisted of 115 patients (76 women and 39 men) with neurotic or personality disorders, participating in group therapy at the Day Care Unit of the Department of Psychiatry, Pomeranian Academy of Medicine in Szczecin between 1992 and 1998. Four groups were formed depending on the diagnosis according to ICD-10 classification: anxiety disorders--F41; somatic disorders--F45; neurotic disorders--F48; and personality disorders--F60 (Table 1). Treatment started and ended with a CV Questionnaire, Symptoms Questionnaire and Personality Factor test. Group psychotherapy was in the open form and the duration of treatment was 12 weeks with 2 sessions per day. In order to detect any improvement in mental health and symptoms, patients were given the Symptoms Questionnaire on a weekly basis. Statistics were done with the SPSS software package. It was found that the global intensity of symptoms before treatment was highest in patients with somatic form of the disorder. In this group after therapy, the intensity of symptoms was lowest, probably because of conversion of primary to secondary anxiety. A considerable decrease in the intensity of symptoms may also be explained by stronger motivation of these patients to benefit from therapy because of their severe symptoms. A link between the clinical diagnosis according to ICD-10 and some symptoms reported by the patients was noted. Thus, the Symptoms Questionnaire could be a useful tool precisely revealing specific symptoms in some disorders. No statistically significant differences on the Symptoms Questionnaire scale based on ICD-10, nor any differences in personality traits were found. The personality traits were different for men and women before and after therapy. As for hysterical symptoms, improvement was greater in women. After psychotherapy, the structure of personality traits improved in both sexes (Fig. 1). An essential alleviation of symptoms was found at the beginning and at the end of treatment (Table 2). The main conclusions are: 1. Group psychotherapy is an efficient method of treatment for patients who suffer from anxiety-related disorders. 2. The Symptoms Questionnaire and Personality Factor test were very useful for assessing the results of psychotherapy. 3. Alleviation of symptoms during treatment differed between men and women in 3 out of 13 symptom clusters and no significant differences between disorders according to ICD-10 were found. Consequently, these criteria are of little value for preliminary evaluation of therapeutic success. 4. Alleviation of symptoms was observed at the beginning and end of treatment.

The mailed survey was completed by 1,205 residency directors (66%). The 769 faculty from those identified programs, who participated in the telephone interview, reported that only 14% of their residency programs offered lectures or conferences on the care of incarcerated persons, yet 44% of the programs had residents caring for incarcerated persons with substance abuse problems, in a clinical setting. Only 22% offered clinical experiences for residents in a correctional facility.We recognize that our survey of correctional health and substance abuse training is limited, but as such, a greater number of respondents to our survey do not teach residents addiction medicine topics pertaining to prevention, evaluation, intervention, and management of the addicted criminal offender/patient in a correctional setting or give adequate clinical exposure to this special population. The data suggests a need to develop and implement educational programs on medical care for this high-risk and expanding population."}, {"Title": "Alexithymia in Egyptian Substance Abusers.", "Abstract": "Alexithymia is thought of as a trait that predisposes to drug abuse. Moreover, it is suggested to be related to type of the substance abused, with the worst-case scenario including a worse prognosis as well as tendency to relapse or even not to seek treatment at all. To address this important subject in Egyptian patients, a sample of 200 Egyptian substance abusers was randomly selected from inpatients in the Institute of Psychiatry, Ain Shams University, Egypt. The study also included 200 group-matched controls. DSM-IV criteria were used for assessment of substance use disorders, and toxicologic urine analysis was used to confirm the substances of abuse. Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS)-Arabic version was used for assessment of alexithymia. It was found that alexithymia was significantly more prevalent in the substance use disorders group as compared to healthy controls. It was also found that among the substance use disorders group, alexithymics reported more polysubstance abuse, more opiate use (other than heroin IV), lower numbers of hospitalizations, lower numbers of reported relapses, and a lower tendency to relapse as a result of internal cues compared to patients without alexithymia. Statistically significant associations were also found between alexithymia and more benzodiazepine abuse and nonpersistence in treatment. The results suggest that alexithymia should be targeted in a treatment setting for substance use disorders."}, {"Title": "The enantiomer debate: current status and future directions.", "Abstract": "Psychopharmacology, and the treatment of depression in particular, is one area where there is currently an increasing awareness of chiral drug phenomena. It is now generally agreed that the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of chiral drugs and their enantiomers should be assessed early on in the drug development process. However, issues surrounding the potential advantages and disadvantages of enantiomeric drugs, compared with racemates, continue to be debated. This article highlights some of the key issues raised during one such debate, the aim of which was to address the hypothesis that each enantiomeric drug should be considered on its own merit. The idea is considered both in general terms and specifically in the context of clinical psychiatry, with an emphasis on the treatment of depression. An update on recent developments in enantiomeric antidepressant therapy is also provided.

The magnitude of the problem of sexual side effects associated with antipsychotic medications has yet to be fully elucidated, but a multitude of references in the literature demonstrate the importance of these side effects in both men and women. All currently used antipsychotic medications are associated with sexual side effects of various types. Although each antipsychotic medication may have a specific side effect profile determined by its various receptor affinities and by the degree to which it elevates serum prolactin, there is currently no evidence that specific side effects can be predicted. Sexual side effects can be categorized according to the phase of the sexual response cycle with which they interfere. Suggestions for clinical evaluation and treatment options are provided, including risk factor modification, dose reduction, switching agents, and addition of other agents. Sexual side effects associated with conventional and atypical antipsychotic medications represent an underestimated and understudied set of side effects that may diminish a patient's quality of life and lead to treatment noncompliance. Clinicians prescribing antipsychotic medications should be familiar with the classification, evaluation, and treatment of these side effects."}, {"Title": "Bioelectrical modulators and the cell membrane in psychiatric medicine.", "Abstract": "The term bioelectrical modulators specifically applies to anticonvulsant drugs and mood stabilizers; however, it also embodies the larger more generic concept that bioelectrical modulators can mitigate any pathological condition caused by a dysregulation of the mechanisms that control cellular excitability, especially the excitability of neurons. The beneficial effects of these agents occur primarily as a result of modulatory influences on the bioelectrical properties of the cellular plasma membrane. Channels, transporters, and most other membrane proteins directly or indirectly involved in excitatory or inhibitory synaptic potentials and action potentials are regulated by protein phosphorylation. These proteins are phosphorylated by a class of enzymes termed protein kinases. The overlapping beneficial effects of antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, omega-3 fatty acids, and nonpsychoactive cannabinoids may be because of their common effects at protein kinases, thus affecting the structure and function of the cell membrane and the cell. These changes should help the cell operate within an optimal level of excitation, which may be related to emerging evidence that these therapeutic agents have neuroprotective value. In this review, the latter concepts are discussed clinically as they relate to pain, stroke, schizophrenia, psychoneuroimmunology, Alzheimer's disease, and stress. It is concluded that there is no separation of psychiatry and medicine at the cellular level; there is only psychiatric medicine."}, {"Title": "[Concepts and scenarios in the teaching of psychiatric nursing and mental health].", "Abstract": "This work approaches the contradictions that are present in the teaching of Psychiatric Nursing and Mental Health in four public universities in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

The instruments used for the investigation were the programs of the courses of Psychiatric Nursing and Mental Health and interviews with fifteen teachers and fourteen students of the area. The central themes of the analysis were the conceptions and scenarios in which the teaching of Psychiatric Nursing and Mental Health takes place. It was observed that these courses focus predominantly the concepts of normality and pathology during the cycle of life and are influenced by the discourse of preventive psychiatry and by psychoanalysis. It was also noticed that the courses mentioned adopt a psychodynamic approach. The majority of the training in the area still takes place in big psychiatric hospitals and emphasizes psychopathologies and its psychosocial determinations which consolidate the hospice model."}, {"Title": "Our traumatic neurosis and its brain.", "Abstract": "During the nineteenth century, physicians either discovered or invented a variety of clinical autobiography called \"traumatic memory.\" Freud produced two versions of this memory, the final version in the 1920s. A revolutionary nosology (DSM-III), adopted in 1980, promised to extirpate Freud and the concept of neurosis from American psychiatry. However, it made a tacit exception for Freud's concept of traumatic neurosis, renaming it \"postraumatic stress disorder.\" The following decades have been a period of intense clinical and scientific interest in this disorder. An influential research program has investigated traumatic neurosis and its brain through variations in cortisol excretion. I describe the history of this program, and examine its distinctive knowledge product. its running narrative of its achievements. The narrative's structure is analyzed and found to resemble a crossword puzzle constructed from heterogenous kinds of inference, recalling The Interpretation of Dreams.

The development of the Forensic Inpatient Observation Scale (FIOS), an observation instrument to assess the non-offending functioning of forensic patients, is described. STUDY 1: In the first study the development of the initial item pool of the FIOS is described. This resulted in an instrument consisting of 78 items and seven scales. The internal reliability of the scales ranged from 0.78 to 0.91. The inter-rater reliability of the scales varied from 0.50 to 0.85 and the test retest reliability over a period of three weeks was high for most scales, ranging from 0.74 to 0.89. STUDY 2: In the second study the FIOS was developed further in another sample of forensic patients. This time exploratory factor analysis with Varimax rotation and post hoc reliability analysis were applied to determine the factor structure among the items. This resulted in an item pool of 35 items, among which six factors could be distinguished that closely resemble the factor structure of the FIOS in study one: (1) self-care, (2) social behaviour, (3) oppositional behaviour, (4) insight offence/problems, (5) verbal skills and (6) distress. Most items have high loadings on the factor they are assigned; 29 items have a loading of 0.60 or higher. The internal consistency of the scales ranges from 0.73 to 0.91 and the scales appear to be measuring independent constructs. Twenty-five out of the 35 items have an inter-rater correspondence of 90% or higher and 30 out of 35 items have an inter-rater correspondence of 87.5% or higher. The inter-rater reliability on the scale level, however, was somewhat less satisfying with correlations ranging from 0.50 to 0.69. DISCUSSION: It is argued that training the observers on a more regular basis will improve the inter-rater reliability. There is some evidence for the convergent validity of the FIOS. The FIOS has some advantages over existing inpatient scales in that it is developed specifically for forensic patients, it does not particularly focus on axis 1 symptoms but includes oppositional behaviour and attitudes to offending."}, {"Title": "Traditional mental health practitioners in Kwara State, Nigeria.", "Abstract": "To assess the knowledge, practice and attitude of traditional mental health practitioners (TMHPs) in four Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Kwara State, Nigeria, on mental health care; to organise training sessions aimed at improving their knowledge base, practice and; to evaluate such training after allowing for a period of practice. STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION: Pre-training evaluation phase: TMHPs were assessed in the area of knowledge, attitude and practice of mental health, with the use of a questionnaire. They were then trained in the concepts of normality and abnormality, types of mental illness, treatment of mental illness including follow up, after-care, relapse prevention, other primary preventive measures, and some introductory talks on some sub-specialties of psychiatry, for example, child psychiatry, old age psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, drug and alcohol abuse and; after a free-practice period of two months, the TMHPs were again reassessed for the impact of the training.\nPre-intervention phase: TMHPs could easily recognise most symptoms of mental illness except undue sadness. The TMHPs also expressed strong belief in the supernatural factor as a cause of mental illness. Some of them beat their patients for therapeutic reasons and; Post-intervention phase: there was a widening of the sense of recognition of TMHPs of important mental symptoms such as undue sadness, social withdrawal and elation.

The evidence and the abuse of evidence-based medicine.", "Abstract": "This study reviews typologies of psychiatric case management and then discusses the efficacy, effectiveness and cost effectiveness of psychiatric case management, with particular focus on evidence from Australia and the UK. Subsequently, it aims to examine the way such evidence has been interpreted in the context of UK psychiatric research and services. Finally it examines the ways in which, by the selective reviewing or editorializing of evidence, case management has been brought into disrepute in the UK.\nThis study reviews literature of the recent evidence for case management, and asks three questions of case management: has it been shown to be efficacious in controlled research, is it effective in applied settings, and is it cost effective? An examination is then made of the concurrent representations of the UK evidence in both the academic literature and the media.\nThere is strong evidence for the efficacy effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of case management in psychiatry, the closer it conforms to active and assertive community treatment models. It appears, however, that studies and evidence-based reviews of case management have possibly been misused and misrepresented in a highly charged atmosphere of professional media debate. The potential for this abuse is not limited to psychiatry and remains a challenge for all evidence-based practice.\nOn the evidence, assertive community treatment case management is one of the most effective interventions in psychiatry today. Despite improving the evidence base for practice (e.g. as has occurred for case-management in psychiatry), evidence-based medicine (EBM) is still susceptible to compromise and misrepresentation, due to unexamined or undeclared bias. Unless this potential for abuse is recognized and checked, EBM in psychiatry is in danger of being discredited at the hand of some of its own proponents. There is a need for more rigorous pursuit of evidence-based psychiatry, including more systematic declaration of bias in all research, whether quantitative or qualitative in design."}, {"Title": "Whose evidence?

A brief review of the extrusion of other diseases from psychiatry.\nConcepts in legislation are based on a dichotomy between mental infirmity and mental illness that has changed over time. This change is the result of shifting perceptions about the basis of illness and disease and the causation of mental symptoms. Mental health legislation is aimed as much at social control of feared behaviour as protecting the ill/incompetent. Guardianship legislation offers a more holistic response that better meets the patient's needs and could be extended to supplant mental health legislation.\nDementia's departure from mental illness reflects psychiatry's continuing marginalization within medicine on an outdated mind/body or illness/disease split. This underlines one of the psychiatrist's roles as the vehicle to 'medically' explain abnormal behaviour. This model means that behaviour, once explained in terms of disease as opposed to illness, can be moved from the direct responsibility of psychiatry into other areas of medicine. Paradoxically, this suggests that the future of psychiatry will be in a completely different direction from its current biological focus."}, {"Title": "Drug epidemiology in Italy: methods and ethical issues.

Several kinds of data were collated from each of the articles, including information about the authors and the journal, as well as information on the focus and type of article.\nWhile publications from South Africa continue to grow in number, relatively few involve collaborative research groups and few authors write more than one paper. Many papers relevant to psychiatry were published in general medical journals and many were from general medical departments. While blacks and females have been included in research, a number of important areas have received little attention.\nPsychiatry research in South Africa requires additional fostering, including additional resources for research training and arguably additional development of subspecialty focuses. Given the limited resources, and the nature of modern research, increased emphasis on collaboration seems advisable. A number of areas in psychiatry deserve particular attention from future researchers."}, {"Title": "The use of special observations: an audit within a psychiatric unit.", "Abstract": "Observation is a fundamental skilled nursing intervention. Special observation is an intensified and often prolonged form of this intervention. Depending upon their nature, and the circumstances under which they are carried out, special observations may invoke varying degrees of stress in both the observer and the observed. They may also raise important ethical and significant financial questions. In psychiatry, special observations are usually imposed where a patient is assessed as representing some degree of risk to themselves or others because of their behaviours or potential behaviours. Special observations vary in their degree of intrusiveness and restrictiveness, and may arouse strong emotions in the patient and staff. Patients may be denied privacy for their most intimate needs, and staff may become a focus for patients' acting-out behaviours. Special observations may be medically imposed with minimal consultation with nursing staff, and where there is no nursing and medical staff agreement on their need, nursing staff may at times feel frustrated and powerless to reduce the patients' discomfort with their situation. This paper presents a study into the use of special observations on psychiatric inpatients across a range of clinical settings. The literature on special observations is reviewed, and the findings of an audit into the documentation of special observations is presented and discussed. The study sites comprised two open acute wards, one elderly functionally mentally ill assessment unit which also treats patients with eating disorders, and a secure high dependency unit, which provides rehabilitation within a secure environment for patients with severe and enduring mental illness."}, {"Title": "From medicalization to hybridization: a postcolonial discourse for psychiatric nurses.", "Abstract": "I begin with an Orwellian dilemma [Orwell G. (1968) The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell, Vol. 1, p. 239. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, New York]: do I 'shoot the elephant' (by writing the abstract) to impress the editor? Or, with the courage of my postmodern convictions, do I lay down my rifle and disregard such suppressive editorial instructions? Bang! My words strafe the paper and the elephant is dead. How difficult it is to stay standing against the powerful currents of the dominant tradition. How easy it is to disavow the inequalities and injustices of that tradition when your livelihood (and your ego) depends upon it. So goes the theme of my paper, that, despite the clarion calls of the illustrious minority to reject the patriarchal model of medical psychiatry, psychiatric nurses continue to be propelled by the twin engines of illness and diagnosis. Yet as soon as psychiatry encounters the 'other' it becomes, in Homi K. Bhabha's words, 'hybridized': a pregnant pause created from the seeds of two different cultures. In this sense, every psychiatric moment becomes a golden opportunity for the psychiatric nurse to abdicate her role as medical factotum. Freed from these contractual obligations, she can join the 'other' and share in his experiences, sustaining rather than negating him within a truly therapeutic alliance. In similar fashion, this article has become a mixture of rhetorical fluidity and structured reality: a hybridized compromise which acknowledges the journal's publication boundaries yet still revels, at times, in the freedom of an open and lyrical text."}, {"Title": "Imperative ideals and the strenuous reality: focusing on acute psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to describe the complexity of the working situation on an acute psychiatric ward as well as how nurses balance tensions between ideals and the reality of daily work. By means of field research, the study aimed to arrive at a deeper understanding of the reality that nursing staff and patients experience. The analysis shows that the acute and unpredictable character of the working situation in combination with short hospital stays results in a tentative and summary nursing care characterized by 'therapeutic superficiality'. This constitutes a hindrance to encountering the patient as a person. The demand on 'treatment effectiveness' creates work-related stress. Hence, a partly articulated conflict develops between the professional and humanistic ideals of psychiatric nursing and the strenuous reality that the staff have to adjust to. This conflict is solved in various ways, depending on whether they belong to the pragmatic, idealist, traditionalist or enforcer attitude in relation to the ward's mandate. The demand on treatment effectiveness seems to promote a medical model in the daily work, even though a humanistic and existential approach can be traced in the nurses' caring philosophy."}, {"Title": "[Biological basis of psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Psychiatry had retained the status of art rather than science for longer than other branches of medicine. However, the views that psychiatric disorders have material basis, existing since antiquity, had eventually been accepted by modern medicine, in spite of troubles connected with the rise of analytical psychiatry. Presently, there are no doubts that structural and functional integration of the brain is a prerequisite of psychical health. The psychical processes are presently regarded as neurobiological phenomena, and the technical progress, particularly brain imaging techniques, allow to investigate, with objective methods, even phenomena such as consciousness, that for long remained in the domain of philosophy. The applied success of biological psychiatry is the introduction of effective psychotropic drugs. It cannot be forgotten, however, that psychotherapeutic methods (which also have neurobiological roots), are as indispensable as psychopharmacotherapy in a modern psychiatric clinic."}, {"Title": "Prevalence of mental health problems in acne patients.", "Abstract": "Acne is the most common of all skin diseases.

From the utilisation of the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) created by Bernstein E and Putnam FW (1986), which is an excellent screening tool for dissociative disorders and constructed on DSM II diagnostic criterions, the authors will show the interest of a psychodynamic analysis of dissociative disorders, in the face of the diagnostic difficulty in relation to several approaches of this concept. This difficulty is studied giving the background to dissociative disorders and depersonalization. Ionescu (1999) shows that between 1890 and 1910 dissociation represents one of major themes of psychology, psychopathology and psychiatry. Then, this interest about dissociation decreases and will be almost non-existent in the middle of the twentieth century. The interest for dissociative disorder will grow in the eighties with north-american studies about multiple personality disorders. Until 1980, dissociative disorders exist in DSM II as a list of symptoms included into hysterical neurosis, among the conversive disorders. In 1980, the publication of DSM III replaces the notion of hysteria with the notion of dissociative disorder. In this way, we can see on the one hand somatoform disorders quarterly corresponding to the ancient version of conversive hysteria, and on the other hand dissociative disorders characterized by a perturbation of consciousness, memory, identity or perception of environment. In 1994, The DSM IV delete the notion of hysteria and neurosis and keeps only the notion of dissociative disorders. They include now the five following categories: dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, depersonalization disorder, dissociative identity disorder, dissociative disorder not otherwise specified (including derealization). Depersonalization disorders consist of \"persistent or recurrent episodes of depersonalization characterized by a feeling of detachment or estrangement from one's self. The individual may feel like an automation or like he or she is living in a dream or movie\" (DSM IV). Depersonalization disorder cannot be diagnosed if it is part of schizophrenia, panic disorder, acute stress disorder or dissociative identity disorder. Various depressive disorders, hypocondriasis or obsessive-compulsive disorders can accompany depersonalization disorder. The first purpose of this study will search the frequency of dissociative disorders and depersonalization in a sample of normal population. Further, the inclusion of depersonalization amongst dissociative disorders seems not so evident: depersonalization belongs to self-consciousness disorder in french psychiatry. This fact seems more logical insofar as dissociative disorders have all together a memory and consciousness perturbation, and this perturbation is missing from depersonalization's feeling. The second purpose will be to clarify and specify the particularity of depersonalization among dissociative diorders, from the psychopathological point of view.\nThe sample (n = 248) is made up of french young adults aged 17 to 30 (mean age = 20, SD = 15 and 24% is male population). Subjects were streamming from universities. The screening tool which was used is the Dissociative Experiences Scale, a 28-item patient questionnaire regarding various dissociative symptoms. The subject is asked to indicate the percentage of time, to the nearest 5%, that particular symptom is experienced. The score is made by adding the various percentages and finding a mean that is expressed in numbers from 0 to 100. Normal scores are in the range of 5 to 15 in american adults.\nThe utilization of principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation is justified by the will to compare this study with American's studies. The mean score obtained is 17.44%, and 13.3% of the scores exceed a psychiatric threshold at 30%. The descriptive analysis shows that the component 1 (PCA without varimax rotation) represents 33.02% of total explained variance. This result demonstrates that the structure of the DES is based on one concept, the same as the american population, it is the concept of dissociation. The Principal Component Analysis with varimax rotation of the DES ratings yielded a tree-factor solution: imaginative absorption (F1), depersonalization-derealization (F2) and dissociative amnesia (F3). Mean score for each factor is respectively: F1 = 21.56%, F2 = 13.95%, F3 = 11.04%. DES reliability was studied through computation of Cronbach's coefficient (0.92). The PCA with varimax rotation brings to the fore a full dissociative disorder without any trouble of memory and consciousness. This fact questions again once more the link between hysteria and dissociative disorders. There is here a clinical distinction between depersonalization-derealization and other dissociative disorders. Indeed, the absence of significant alteration of memory and conscience is specific of depersonalization and derealization in this study.\nFinally, this study concurs with DSM IV dissociative criterions. At last, one factor of PCA is composed by the association of depersonalization and derealization, in contradiction with DSM IV definition. This result shows that, into the french population, we cannot divide the two concepts."}, {"Title": "European perspectives: a carer's view.", "Abstract": "To present the work of the European Federation of Associations of Families of Mentally III People (EUFAMI) and discuss issues of concern to family carers.\nThe problem areas identified and discussed by family carers are presented on the basis of questionnaire surveys organized by EUFAMI.

These surveys allowed a follow-up of evolutions according to the pathology and mode of treatment in a context where outpatient treatments are becoming increasingly frequent.\nA census of the patients was made at a given moment, between one and fifteen days according to the mode of treatment. One sector out of two was surveyed, using a systematic selection process. The ICD-10 was used for diagnosis reference. The same methodology was applied in 1993 and 1998. Comparisons were made with the data supplied by the sectors annually and with the data concerning the general population in order to calculate rates per age groups.\nBetween 1993 and 1998, the number of patients increased by +37% in outpatient care, and in part time care, and decreased by -12% in full time care. Rates for patients increased for all age groups in outpatient and part time care, more particularly for the 35 to 49 years old. Conversely, rates decreased in full time care, above all for patients over seventy. In each mode of treatment, the number of patients presenting mood disorders and neurotic disorders increased more than the average, and the proportion of patients with organic mental disorders and mental retardation decreased. Evolutions were different according to the mode of treatment schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders, and disorders of adult personality and behaviour.\nRecourse to outpatient care and part time care increased considerably over five years but evolutions were markedly different from one diagnosis to another. In full time care, the decrease more particularly concerned certain pathologies and age groups.

Mental health and drug services operate from different policy systems and are generally not co-ordinated with each other, leaving the onus on the patient to move effectively through health systems. The common statement that GPs are ideal health professionals to manage concurrent problems is contrasted with the evident barriers in general practice such as lack of time, knowledge, skills and confidence. Models for managing concurrent problems tend towards shared care. However, these models either have received mixed evidence (e.g. consultant-liaison psychiatry) or are amenable to development but remain untested (e.g. co-ordinated care, community health centre programs).

Although this therapeutic relationship is of central importance for mental health care, it appears to be relatively neglected in psychiatric research. Empirical research has for the most part adopted concepts and methods developed in psychotherapy and general medical practice. Hence, unpacking the presuppositions that have informed research on the therapeutic relationship to date may be a useful first step in developing this field.\nA review of the literature was carried out.\nSix central theories are identified as framing the definitions and methods on this topic: role theory, psychoanalysis, social constructionism, systems theory, social psychology and cognitive behaviourism. To date, role theory, psychoanalysis and systems theory appear to be the frameworks most often applied in research in this field. Each perspective offers a unique emphasis in the analysis of the therapeutic relationship, which is reflected in the empirical work from each perspective discussed herein.\nNone of the theories identified have been fully specified and comprehensively investigated in psychiatric settings. However, more than one approach may be used for thinking about relationships, depending on the treatment situation. Further specification and testing of the theories in psychiatric practice--taking account of the specific context--is warranted to underpin more pragmatic research.

This led to understanding, and the physician was regarded a friend and someone who one could tell anything. Bjerre acted in a time of paternalism, but used this to release autonomy for the patient, so that he could be liberated. Follow up was very important, mainly through letters."}, {"Title": "Fall occurrence in a geriatric psychiatry setting before and after a fall prevention program.", "Abstract": "A fall prevention program providing staff education, quantitative assessment of gait and balance, risk factors assessment, and evidence-based interventions was introduced on two geriatric wards of a regional psychiatric hospital. A within-subjects comparison was made of fall occurrence during the 4-month pre-intervention phase and the 4-month post-intervention phase using Fisher's exact test. Among those (N = 23) who survived the duration of the study, significantly fewer falls occurred in the post-intervention time period than in the pre-intervention time period (p < 0.01). Comprehensive assessment, problem identification, and intervention planning by nurses may serve to reduce the number of falls among elderly individuals with severe psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Ethical considerations on dynamic psychiatry and the tradition of relationship in psychoanalysis.

The Berlin School of Dynamic Psychiatry enlarges the interpersonal principle with the therapeutic concept of group dynamics, identity and of social energy, giving it an implication of therapeutic optimism and a new ethical significance."}, {"Title": "Using language in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Much of the diagnosis and definition of psychiatric disorders depends on language behaviour. Both the lay and clinical communities recognize that some atypical language behaviour helps to the identify psychiatric disorders. A functional approach to language provides the means to classify the atypicalities in meaning and in wordings that are associated with psychiatric disorders. Culture levels, register, genre, context, vocabulary-grammar, and sound must all be taken into account in considering language atypicalities. Language simultaneously conveys 3 kinds of meaning--ideational, interpersonal and textual. Individually or combined, these 3 kinds of meaning can be used to describe the atypical language behaviour associated with psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Syphilis in clinical psychiatry: a review.", "Abstract": "Syphilis is a potentially fatal infectious disease that has a long history of association with psychiatry. Recent developments in epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment guidelines warrant a review of the current relationship of syphilis to clinical psychiatry. After a recent peak of incidence in the United States, syphilis is once again on the decline. Although the prevalence of syphilis remains endemic in certain locations, it has been targeted for elimination. Meanwhile, diagnostic testing remains complex and imperfect, especially for the detection of late stages of infection and neurosyphilis. The U.S. Public Health Service recently revised guidelines for the evaluation and management for syphilis. This paper discusses these developments and their specific implications to psychiatric practice. The likelihood of discovering previously unsuspected cases through screening and recommendations on high-risk groups to screen are discussed. A case example illustrates some of the key concepts."}, {"Title": "Factors associated with the coping of parents with a child in psychiatric inpatient care.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to establish the parental coping' factors associated with having a child in psychiatric inpatient care. The data were collected from 19 hospitals with child psychiatry units. At the time of data collection, all parents of children in psychiatric inpatient care in these hospitals were recruited. The method of data collection was a questionnaire (n = 79). The data were analysed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows statistical software. The connections between variables were studied with cross-tabulation, and the chi2 test was used to determine significance. Changes in internal and external family relationships and matters related to the upbringing of the child with mental problems statistically correlated significantly with parental coping (P < 0.001). Problem-oriented and emotionally-oriented coping strategies, skills and palliative strategies correlated significantly with parental coping (P < 0.001). Emotional support, support for the care and upbringing of the child in inpatient care, and love and acceptance also had statistically significant associations with parental coping (P < 0.001)."}, {"Title": "Utilization of health services among patients referred to an alcohol treatment program.", "Abstract": "This study assessed utilization of health services among 1,317 adults referred to an outpatient Psychiatry Department alcohol treatment program from July, 1988 through December, 1989.

In order to verify this clinical impression, we carried out a retrospective analysis about cocaine abuse by opioid-dependent patients undergoing methadone maintenance therapy at the drug addiction clinic, Department of Psychiatry, University of Vienna.\nSupervised urinalysis was performed on a frequent basis in 160 patients during the investigational time frame of 1997 and 1999. Concomitant consumption of opioids, cocaine and benzodiazepines in urine toxicology results (n = 2242) was compared in a post hoc analysis.\nIn 1997, 45% of urine toxicology tests were positive for opioids, 14.1% for cocaine and 22.1% for benzodiazepines. In 1999, however, 33.1% urine toxicology tests showed positive results for opioids, 22.2% for cocaine and 24% for benzodiazepines. It could be shown that the number of cocaine positive toxicology results increased significantly (p < 0.05) over the course of two years, and that the number of opioid positive tests decreased significantly (p < 0.05), whereas benzodiazepine consumption did not change. Age, and the duration of opioid dependence showed a significant influence on cocaine positive urinalysis.\nThe significant increase of additional cocaine consumption in methadone maintained patients reflects the enhanced availability of the substance in Austria, as it has been shown in other European countries and the USA. In addition, evidence based treatment trials are needed to prove the efficacy of alternative opioid maintenance therapy and to evaluate whether cocaine consumption is less of a problem."}, {"Title": "The Wal-Marting of American psychiatry: an ethnography of psychiatric practice in the late 20th century.", "Abstract": "U.S. psychiatry has been radically reorganized by changes in the way the psychiatric hospital, the asylum, is funded. The imposition and internalization of cost control measures are major elements of this reorganization. This paper traces the ways in which cost control methods associated with managed care have produced new ways of organizing and patterning clinical work and clinical knowledge.\nParticipant observation, used in qualitative sociological research, was undertaken in three settings: a public hospital, a private hospital with roots in the history of the asylum, and a for-profit hospital chain. The research consisted of observation of usual clinic practices and interviews with clinicians and ancillary staff, such as utilization reviewers, concerning their construction of and understandings about their work experience. In addition, interviews with personnel at a number of managed care companies was arranged although actual ethnographic experience was not performed in these companies due to declined permission. Interviews included clinicians whose experiences bridged the pre- and post-managed care eras.\nThis paper argues that the widespread adoption of Quality Assurance and Utilization Management procedures has created new standards of evaluation and treatment. These standards grow out of a transition from a person-centered to a population-based data base. They are justified by a conviction on the part of managed care proponents that good clinical treatment is equivalent to efficient cost control. This epistemological change results in the development of a clinical knowledge patterned along algorithmic pathways rather than subjective understanding. An increased and more rapid rationalization of psychiatry is the result. This rationalization process has produced moral dilemmas for practicing clinicians as they struggle to redefine their professional purposes and identities within a new order.\nThe rise of the 'Quality Movement' has led to the reconstruction of clinical knowledge as a result of the imposition of social practices influenced by the cultural consequences of capitalism. A peculiarly American psychiatry is the result."}, {"Title": "The use of sacred story in a psychiatry spirituality group.", "Abstract": "Describes the philosophy and methodology for using sacred stories from several religious traditions with psychiatric patients.

Paradigmatic oscillations between concepts of the present time and the views of Hohenheim are analyzed. Four kinds of \"taubsucht\" are presented by Hohenheim in his earliest psychopathologically orientated treatise \"Von der Taubsucht\". Their relations towards later texts are described. He introduces many disorders in later texts, e.g. \"mania\", \"lunatici\", \"ebricata\", \"phantasmata\", \"vihisch vernunft\", that resemble aspects of the four kinds of \"taubsucht\". Three main principles of etiology are documented and characterized as \"theological-ethical\", \"elemental-sidereal\", and \"alchemistical\". Contrary to today's preferred \"descriptive\" approach the main principle of Paracelsian classification is seen as \"etiological-dimensional\". Seven etiologic dimensions are described. Hierarchical correspondences between these dimensions are investigated. The seven dimensions are characterized as: a) Elemental influences (incorporation of psychotropic substances) b) Firmamental-sidereal influences (astrological and astronomical emanations) c) Spiritual influences (spirits deranging man's mind) d) Alchemistical (\"chemical\") influences e) Secondary diseases (caused by some pre-existing disorder) f) Intrinsic ethical and moral dispositions as the final cause of disorders (theological-ethical view) g) Heredity. By evaluating the paradigmatic aspects of Hohenheims nosological approach, differences with today's mainstream-views of psychiatry are seen in the field of \"invisible\" (spiritual and transcendental), \"etiological-dimensional\" explanations for the derangement of the mind (see b, c, f). Potential similarities are considered in the field of \"visible\" (materialistic), dimensions (see a, d, e, g). It is concluded that Hohenheim strives towards an integration of spiritual and materialistic aspects in the application of etiological and nosological tools. Hohenheims concepts are summarized as a 16th century \"integrative\" psychopathological approach."}, {"Title": "[Correspondence between Winkler and Von Monakow. 2.

They discussed a number of scientific subjects in their correspondence, such as the localisation of functions in the central nervous system and in particular Von Monakow's concept of 'diaschisis'. This concept explained the phenomenon that symptoms during the acute phase of central nervous system disorders are more extensive and of a different nature than those during the chronic phase. The controversy between the neuron theory and the reticular theory was also discussed in the correspondence. One of the reasons for the correspondence and meetings was the plan to compile an atlas of the brain although due to the outbreak of World War I this did not come to fruition. Finally there was an extensive correspondence concerning the psychoanalytic movement within the psychiatry, of which Winkler and Von Monakow, as biologically orientated neuropsychiatrists, were highly critical.

Originally considered to be an independent disease entity characterized by mental and motor abnormalities, catatonia was later viewed as a subtype of schizophrenia as it is the case in current classifications like ICD-10 and DSM-IV. Since catatonic symptoms were observable not only in schizophrenic psychoses, but also in affective, somatic or even psychogenic disorders, many researchers today consider catatonia as a nosologically unspecific syndrome. In the end, the traditional conceptions did not succeed in defining catatonia as a clinically homogeneous and valid diagnosis. An independent conception was elaborated by the Wernicke-Kleist-Leonhard school of psychiatry. Based on a precise differentiation of psychomotor disturbances, two essentially different forms of catatonic psychoses have been separated, systematic and periodic catatonias which differ in symptomatology, prognosis and treatment."}, {"Title": "[Winkler's rabbits: the separation of the chairs in neurology and psychiatry in the Netherlands].", "Abstract": "In 1914/15 and in 1925/26 the selection of candidates for the professorships of psychiatry and neurology at the Universities of Amsterdam and Utrecht was fiercely debated. The central theme was the question whether either anatomy or clinical observation was the basic element of psychiatry. Eventually the choice for the latter of these two possibilities led to a separation of the two disciplines psychiatry and neurology. Paradoxically the stubbornness of the main defender of the anatomical standpoint, Cornelis Winkler, the professor in psychiatry and neurology who in 1914 went from Amsterdam to Utrecht where he retired in 1925, catalysed this divisionary process."}, {"Title": "Tolerability profile of atypical antipsychotics in children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "Antipsychotics are frequently used in the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions in children and adolescents. Atypical antipsychotics have come to the forefront in child psychiatry due largely to their tolerability profiles as well as their efficacy. Potential treatment options include clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. A number of studies investigating the use of clozapine have been published in children; however, owing to the frequent monitoring required for agranulocytosis, the use of clozapine may be restricted to patients with treatment-refractory disease. With accumulating data on the development of glucose intolerance in adults receiving clozapine, closer monitoring of bodyweight and fasting blood glucose is imperative. Clozapine also has an increased seizure risk, therefore a baseline electroencephalogram should be performed, as well as continued vigilance for this adverse effect. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that is generally well tolerated and numerous studies have been published investigating this drug in children. Unlike clozapine, its receptor interaction profile lends itself toward increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and hyperprolactinaemia. Bodyweight gain is a common adverse effect, although somewhat less than that reported with olanzapine. Baseline liver function studies prior to initiation of this medication are recommended. Risperidone-induced mania has been reported in adults and, therefore, increased caution should be used when deciding to treat children and adolescents with risperidone, particularly in those with a predisposition toward mania. Olanzapine, like risperidone, has also been associated with onset of mania in adults. Olanzapine has a receptor profile that results in significant risk for bodyweight gain and sedation. Furthermore, this drug has been linked to the development of glucose intolerance; thus, it is important to monitor bodyweight and fasting blood glucose on a frequent basis. Less information is known about quetiapine in children and adolescents. Reports about its efficacy and tolerability vary. Quetiapine appears to have increased risk for sedation and bodyweight gain, albeit less than that of olanzapine. The compound appears to be less likely to induce EPS. Finally, ziprasidone has recently been approved for use in the adult population. This compound, in terms of its receptor profile, has more in common with risperidone. This suggests a potential for increased risk of EPS and hyperprolactinaemia. It also has an increased risk of QTc prolongation; thus, a baseline electrocardiogram is suggested, particularly in those patients with a history of cardiovascular illness. Lack of evidence for bodyweight gain with ziprasidone is a considerable advantage."}, {"Title": "[Treatment of alcoholics at a day care hospital].", "Abstract": "The daily hospital (further in text D.H.) in the allcomprehensive program of the protection of the mental health has the multidimensional activity in the performing of the program of the primary, secondary and tertiary prevention.

Society's attitude has varied throughout history. When psychiatry appeared in the nineteenth century it medicalized the problem. First with Esquirol in 1838, followed by Delmas in 1932. Whereas Durkheim, with his theory of anomia in 1897, defended the sociological position presented in the form of a law: the percentage of suicides increases in inverse proportion to the social integration of the individual and one should not forget Halbwachs (1930) in this debate. Re-medicalization was mainly due to Deshaies in 1947, who dismissed the excessiveness of these two trends, while remaining open to them. According to his theory, \"suicidal equivalences\" should also be taken into account, even if the individual's death wish is subconscious. CONTRIBUTION OF THE PSYCHOANALYTICAL THEORY: This contribution is considerable and has gone through several stages. Currently, psychoanalysts accept the influence of extrinsic factors in suicidal behavior. This is the case, for example, for the pre-morbid states or the initiating factors, the importance of which are no longer denied and which favor regression and destruction of the personality and resulting in suicidal behavior. DOES A CLINICAL PROFILE EXIST?: Fifteen percent of depressive patients commit suicide. With regard to the act itself, it is far more dangerous and violent in the elderly than in young adults. The suicide rate of elderly people is 2-fold greater than that of the general population. Suicidal equivalents consist in letting oneself die, because of the loss in will to fight that characterizes the classical syndrome of this attitude.\nIn France there are around 12,000 suicidal deaths per year among 150,000 suicide attempts, i.e., 1 attempt every 4 minutes and 1 suicide every 40 minutes. This corresponds to a raw mortality rate of 20 out of 100,000 inhabitants. However, epidemiologists consider that these figures are underestimated by around 20%. Since 1983, they exceed the mortality rate caused by road accidents (8,000/year in France). MISINTERPRETED DEPRESSION: Most suicides result from depression that was not recognized and treated as such. Clinical intuition is essential. It is the risk of suicide that renders the diagnosis of depression urgent. Retrospective surveys show that 50% of individuals having attempted suicide had consulted a doctor the month preceding their act. It is therefore important to organize the prevention of such risks. When depressive patients do not express any suicidal tendency, it is essential to raise the subject. In most cases, verbalization relieves the patients. However the eventual hospitalization of such patients should always be boum in mind."}, {"Title": "The prevalence and correlates of capacity to consent to a geriatric psychiatry admission.", "Abstract": "In the UK the recent House of Lords ruling on the Bournewood case provided a statutory basis for admitting patients into psychiatric beds who lack the capacity to consent, but do not dissent, without recourse to detention under the Mental Health Act. A study to ascertain the prevalence and correlates of the lack of capacity to consent to geriatric psychiatry inpatient admission was undertaken. All consecutive acute inpatient admissions to a geriatric psychiatry unit over a six-month period were examined by an independent research psychiatrist (SM). Data on demography, diagnosis, severity of cognitive impairment, insight, the SM's assessment of capacity to consent to the admission and the consultant psychiatrists' assessment of the capacity to consent to the admission were ascertained. The overall prevalence of lack of capacity to consent to geriatric psychiatry inpatient admission was 48%. It was associated with a diagnosis of dementia, increased severity of cognitive impairment, reduced insight and detention under the Mental Health Act. The kappa concordance between SM's and the consultant psychiatrist's assessment of capacity was modest at 0.6. These findings require replication in a larger multi-centre study, perhaps using standardised instruments to measure capacity. A large number of psychiatric patients are informally admitted despite lacking the capacity to consent to the admission because they do not dissent.

Whereas the cortical silent period reflects the general degree of inhibitory mechanisms mainly within the sensorimotor loop, intracortical excitability measures the focused degree of inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms within the motor cortex. In child and adolescent psychiatric disorders with uncontrollable motor behavior such as tics in tic disorder or motoric hyperactivity in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), different dysfunctional patterns of motor system excitability could be demonstrated compared to age-matched healthy controls: (1) In tic disorder, a shortened cortical silent period was observed, providing evidence of deficient inhibitory mechanisms within the sensorimotor loop, probably primarily at the level of the basal ganglia. (2) In ADHD, a decreased intracortical inhibition was found, probably reflecting deficient inhibitory mechanisms within the motor cortex (but enhancement of intracortical inhibition after oral intake of 10 mg methylphenidate). In order to investigate neurophysiological aspects of comorbidity, (3) motor system excitability was also measured in children with combined ADHD and tic disorder. The findings of a reduced intracortical inhibition as well as a shortened cortical silent period in these comorbid children provide evidence of additive effects at the level of motor system excitability. These decreased inhibitory mechanisms within the entire sensorimotor loop and especially the motor cortex could be essential neurobiological substrates of the deficient inhibitory motor control and regulation, respectively, in tic disorder and ADHD."}, {"Title": "[When should inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric treatment be terminated?].", "Abstract": "As up to now no thorough empirical investigation of the length of stay during inpatient treatment exists, the criteria for the decision to terminate inpatient treatment were studied.\nThe opinions of experts in child psychiatry were collected by means of a three-part questionnaire that included a general section together with questions concerning the respective profession group of each expert, a structured section, and a section with open questions. 200 questionnaires were mailed to members of different professional groups at all hospitals for child and adolescent psychiatry in Lower Saxony and Bremen. 112 questionnaires were returned. Data were evaluated descriptively and by means of analyses of variance to determine whether the assessment patterns differ among the various groups.\nComplex criteria were found by attributing answers to both the structural and the open questions, which included patient-related aspects (particularly the course of symptoms and the child's/adolescent's development of competence), conditions in the family, administrative influences (aftercare and post-discharge placement), problems in the therapeutic setting, aspects of group dynamics between patients and staff, as well as problems involving motivation and compliance.

The present study examines self-reported success and personal satisfaction with their careers in a cohort of psychiatrists followed for more than 20 years.\nA total of 29 psychiatrists, all of whom had participated in a study during their residency 21 to 24 years earlier, completed a self-report questionnaire. The first set of questions addressed the type and characteristics of their professional practice; the second set assessed aspects of their nonprofessional practice; and the third set assessed aspects of their nonprofessional, personal lifestyles. The personality traits of neuroticism and extraversion were assessed during the residency years and were used as predictors. Composite measures of self-perceived external success and personal satisfaction were computed. Regression models were constructed to determine the best predictors of these composite measures.\nNeuroticism proved to be a significant predictor of external success but not of personal satisfaction, with higher scores predicting a lower rating of perceived external success. There were 2 practice characteristics--involvement with research and practising from an orientation other than psychoanalytic--that predicted perception of success. One personal lifestyle characteristic--the perception that one's nonprofessional life sustained professional life--also predicted perception of success. The best predictor of personal satisfaction was overall satisfaction with nonprofessional aspects of life.\nPersonality, nonprofessional social support, and engaging in research are associated with greater perceived success and personal satisfaction with a career in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Typology of elderly patients hospitalized in psychiatry: evaluation of psychiatric antecedents before age 60].", "Abstract": "To take care of elderly patients in psychiatric hospital sets specific problems. It is interesting to know the mode, the frequency, and the reasons of these hospitalizations, to improve the medical care given to these subjects. We made a prospective study with elderly patients hospitalized in a psychiatric institution. The results were completed in discussions with the medical care staff. During the study (January and February 1997), 112 elderly patients, about more than 60 years old, were hospitalized in Villejuif' specialized hospital (inpsychiatric units). Informations about social facts, main psychiatric previous, reasons of the hospitalization, the caring and the evolution of these subjects were collected. The main important reflexion we did observe was the significant difference between elderly patients hospitalized in psychiatric units, with or without psychiatric previous before the age of 60. Those who were hospitalized at the first time in psychiatric units before 60, presented a medium aged population, younger than the other group. They also presented more delusion with psychosis, were more frequently hospitalized longly in psychiatric units, took neuroleptics, and their somatic associate pathologies were less difficult to take care of. In the second group including the elderly patients without psychiatric previous before 60, we did observe very different characteristics: the diagnosis of most of the patients is dementia; these elderly subjects leaved mostly at home, they presented more sadness, aggression, or social inappropriate behaviour. Depression is a more frequent diagnosis. This study of all the elderly patients admitted in a psychiatric hospital confirmed the population's heterogeneity. The existence of an hospitalisation in psychiatric unit before sixty represented a pertinent test to a major and simple approach of these differences. The psychiatric unit which receives more and more elderly patients take care of their differences to the organisation of care needs between the gerontopsychiatric patients types. The patients with a late gerontopsychiatric's disease could need a specific hospitalization in gerontopsychiatric units, especially organised to deliver psychiatric cares and somatic cares, including medical geriatric practicer and medical care staff formed to the dependence need care."}, {"Title": "[Nutritional status and risk in hospitalized children].", "Abstract": "A few studies report malnutrition in hospitalized patients.\nThis one-day cross-sectional survey performed in January 1999 assessed nutritional status and protein-energy intake in a pediatric population hospitalized in medicine or surgery units.

Just as fasting girls and victorian anorexics gained attention and respect in their families and communities, modern adolescent anorexics often derive reinforcement from peers and community acceptance of their self-starvation.

This study, in a large university teaching acute care hospital in Canada, examined the effect of psychosocial problems on length of stay, controlling for patient demographics and medical condition. Average days stay for Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGs) was used as a proxy variable for severity of medical condition, and the Person-in-Environment (PIE) classification system was used to measure psychosocial problems. Data were collected on a sample of 160 patients; 78 in psychiatry and 82 in medical/surgical wards. In a regression analysis, the severity of the patient's psychosocial problem was a more significant predictor of length of stay than the DRG variable. The identification of psychosocial problems and their severity add an important and complementary dimension to research into the effectiveness of social workers in reducing length of stay. Workers found clients had significantly more problems related to their social role functioning than problems in the environment."}, {"Title": "Impact of clozapine prescription on inpatient resource utilization.", "Abstract": "Although clozapine has been demonstrated to be clinically superior to typical neuroleptics in refractory schizophrenia, it is also more expensive. It had been hoped that the increased costs associated with its use would be offset by decreases in the utilization of other expensive resources, especially inpatient care. All patients who had clozapine initiated during an inpatient hospitalization within the VA for schizophrenia over a 4-year period (N = 1415) were matched with a comparison group (N = 2,830) on key service utilization variables and other possible confounding demographic and clinical variables using propensity scoring-an accepted statistical method, although still relatively little used in psychiatry. By using centralized VA databases, subsequent inpatient resource utilization for the 3 years after index discharge was examined. Veterans exposed to clozapine while inpatients recorded 33 (36%) more inpatient days in the subsequent 3 years after discharge than the comparison group (124 +/- 190 days vs. 91 +/- 181 days, p = .0002). When all patients exposed to clozapine were divided according to whether they had received 1 year of clozapine treatment after discharge, those that received less than 1 year's treatment recorded significantly more inpatient days than either those maintained on clozapine or controls. These results suggest that in actual practice clozapine treatment may cost substantially more than treatment with conventional neuroleptics."}, {"Title": "[Wilhelm Griesinger (1817-1868)--his knowledge of psychiatry from the historical and current perspective].", "Abstract": "Thorough re-analysis of Wilhelm Griesinger's scientific work is very interesting not only from the historical point of view, but also with regard to the present-day debate about the role and self-image of psychiatry. In the literature, Griesinger's ideas are often reported in a rather undifferentiated and condensed manner. Therefore, it may be overlooked that he did not avoid getting involved with the principal epistemological issues of psychiatry (which were an unpopular topic in his time as well), but discussed them intensively and with a constant look at their relevance for clinical and research purposes."}, {"Title": "[Aggressive behavior in psychiatric patients.

Thirty-one staff members who participated in the self-defence training were given the opportunity to evaluate the program by means of self-rating scales. The results show that in their experience the training increases the extent of self-protective behavior and simultaneously decreases the amount of tension in assault-situations. In addition, we evaluated 18 assault-situations, that occurred during the last 2 years. We found out that 5 of 6 staff members who participated in the self-defence-training could protect themselves successfully in contrast to only 2 of 12 staff members who did not participate in this training.

Psychopathy is related to early-onset delinquency, number and severeness of violent crimes, number of sexual victims in rapists, and unfavorable legal prognosis. Recent research has also indicated that the treatment of psychopaths is complicated by low levels of motivation and high rates of attrition. In psychiatric-diagnostic terms, psychopathy is related to substance abuse and dependency and to cluster A and B personality disorders (PD), especially to antisocial and borderline PD. In juvenile with \"psychopathic tendencies\", a relationship to impulsivity, emotional and behavioral difficulties, and learning behavior (card sorting test) had been shown and interpreted by reference to an anatomical level. In connection with these findings, the relevance of psychopathic disorder for testimonies on legal responsibility should also be discussed again.

Recent research has identified a transitional state between the cognitive changes of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Mild cognitive impairment refers to the clinical condition between normal aging and AD in which persons experience memory loss to a greater extent than one would expect for age, yet they do not meet currently accepted criteria for clinically probable AD. When these persons are observed longitudinally, they progress to clinically probable AD at a considerably accelerated rate compared with healthy age-matched individuals. Consequently, this condition has been recognized as suitable for possible therapeutic intervention, and several multicenter international treatment trials are under way. Because this is a topic of intense interest, a group of experts on aging and MCI from around the world in the fields of neurology, psychiatry, geriatrics, neuropsychology, neuroimaging, neuropathology, clinical trials, and ethics was convened to summarize the current state of the field of MCI. Participants reviewed the world scientific literature on aging and MCI and summarized the various topics with respect to available evidence on MCI. Diagnostic criteria and clinical outcomes of these subjects are available in the literature. Mild cognitive impairment is believed to be a high-risk condition for the development of clinically probable AD. Heterogeneity in the use of the term was recognized, and subclassifications were suggested. While no treatments are recommended for MCI currently, clinical trials regarding potential therapies are under way. Recommendations concerning ethical issues in the diagnosis and the management of subjects with MCI were made."}, {"Title": "Evaluating satisfaction with a child and adolescent psychological telemedicine outreach service.", "Abstract": "A child and adolescent telepsychiatry service in rural New South Wales was evaluated.

In addition to assessing their pre-and post-training knowledge, attitude, and practice toward psychiatry, 2 internal Consultant Psychiatrists and participants evaluated the training course providing appropriate feedback to the organizers and trainers for modifying several adopted training methods, as well as a curriculum for subsequent courses.\nThe 2-week psychiatric training of the medical personnel resulted in identifying several pros and cons of implementing this project at primary health care centers. Additionally, the immediate and the post-training evaluations of trainees by numerous methods were characterized by favourable changes in their attitude, knowledge and enhanced motivation to practice psychiatry at primary health care centers.\nThe implementation of this project by training the first 3 groups of health personnel was successful, as evidenced both by the healthy encouraging comments of the evaluators and the post-training favourable positive responses of the trainees.

There are now over 20 such programs, but there is little information on how these doubly trained physicians actually practice. In 1997, the authors surveyed the 268 physicians with board certification in both internal medicine and psychiatry that were listed with the American Board of Medical Specialties. Only 15% practiced any type of medicine at all; the rest were involved only in the practice of psychiatry. Although 75% identified themselves only as psychiatrists and worked predominantly in psychiatry, 95% reported using both their medical and psychiatric training in their professional work.

A common problem of most studies in this field regards the localization of the magnetic coil with respect to the cortex. This article reviews the currently used methods and proposes a neuronavigational approach. The method of neuronavigated TMS is described and discussed in detail. It is used to guide the magnetic coil on an individual basis to a structurally or functionally predetermined cortical area while monitoring the location of the coil in relation to the subject's head in real time. Possible applications of TMS in combination with functional neuroimaging in clinical research within a cognitive neuroscience framework are discussed. Future applications of TMS should take individual anatomy into account, and neuronavigation provides the means to do so."}, {"Title": "Associative processing and paranormal belief.", "Abstract": "In the present study we introduce a novel task for the quantitative assessment of both originality and speed of individual associations. This 'BAG' (Bridge-the-Associative-Gap) task was used to investigate the relationships between creativity and paranormal belief. Twelve strong 'believers' and 12 strong 'skeptics' in paranormal phenomena were selected from a large student population (n > 350). Subjects were asked to produce single-word associations to word pairs. In 40 trials the two stimulus words were semantically indirectly related and in 40 other trials the words were semantically unrelated. Separately for these two stimulus types, response commonalities and association latencies were calculated. The main finding was that for unrelated stimuli, believers produced associations that were more original (had a lower frequency of occurrence in the group as a whole) than those of the skeptics. For the interpretation of the result we propose a model of association behavior that captures both 'positive' psychological aspects (i.e., verbal creativity) and 'negative' aspects (susceptibility to unfounded inferences), and outline its relevance for psychiatry. This model suggests that believers adopt a looser response criterion than skeptics when confronted with 'semantic noise'. Such a signal detection view of the presence/absence of judgments for loose semantic relations may help to elucidate the commonalities between creative thinking, paranormal belief and delusional ideation."}, {"Title": "Sensory impairments, intellectual disability and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The present review looks at: (1) prevalence studies of sensory impairments in people with intellectual disability (ID); (2) studies looking at psychological and psychiatric disorders in people with sensory impairments; and (3) studies that have examined the association of sensory impairments with autism. Research has indicated that sensory impairments are more common in people with ID. Psychiatric disorders are believed to be more common in children with visual impairment (VI) when associated with other handicaps. Some authors believe that hearing impairment (HI) can result in personality disorders. Studies have also shown a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in children with HI and a higher incidence of deaf people in psychiatric hospitals than in the general population. Psychiatric disorders in children with HI are particularly associated with low IQ and low communication ability, especially in those with multiple handicaps. There is little evidence for a higher incidence of schizophrenia in people with HI. Blind people demonstrate many autistic-like features and there has been discussion in the literature as to their cause. Deaf people also demonstrate some similar features to those in autism, but an association with autism has not been conclusively made. Deaf-blind people commonly demonstrate problem behaviour (e.g. self-injury). Usher syndrome, which is the most common cause of deaf-blindness, is associated with psychiatric disorders, particularly psychosis.

The reported case studies suggest that ECT may be of value in treating severe psychiatric disorders in mentally retarded patients, with similar indications as in general psychiatry.

To date, it is no question anymore, whether biological child and adolescent psychiatry and social psychiatry are contradictory or in line. They are in a steady process, look at the same development, the same symptom from different points of view. They describe it with concepts, which are not understood from the other position, because of different contexts and possible because of ideologic influences.

Reports about these regular visits followed semi-standardized protocols. The ESMS was used to classify 365 institutions visited between 1996 and 1998, and numbers of places per 100 000 inhabitants were used to compare the 24 regions of the state.\nThe visitation protocols as the main source of information and the ESMS as a classification tool proved to be useful. The interrater-reliability was high, and the validity of the data was supported by other official statistics. Outpatient care was provided by 4 psychiatrists and 3 psychologists in private practice per 100 000 inhabitants, which is low compared to the German mean. 10 secure beds (forensic psychiatry), 48 acute beds, 13 elective beds and 13 day hospital places per 100 000 inhabitants were available for inpatient care, with a marked shortage of beds in the southern and eastern regions of the state. Non-acute non-hospital residential services with indefinite stay and 24 hour support accumulated to 240 places per 100 000, with regional differences ranging from less than 100 to more than 1000. About 80 % among the residents of these institutions were considered as suffering from \"mental retardation\", suggesting some persisting institutionalism. All other residential services taken together (time-limited or with less than 24 hour support) came to 24 places per 100 000. Sheltered workshop places corresponded to the number of persons in residential homes. Other facilities offering paid work or work-related activities were scarce; some services providing structured activity or social contact were available in urban agglomerations. The data about the frequency of contacts in outpatient and community services are limited.\nPsychiatric care in Germany is fragmentary, as regards providers and funding. Information collected by the \"Committee for Issues of Psychiatric Care in Sachsen-Anhalt\", taken mainly from visitation protocols, was sufficient to establish a general survey over 24 regions of this federal state. We propose to repeat this approach regularly to monitor developments in the field of social psychiatry for further planning and interventions.

In German journals of general psychiatry papers dealing with social psychiatric topics are rarely found. By contrast in international, particularly in European journals the proportion of papers on social psychiatric topics originating from German authors is quite high as compared to papers on other topics. Applied research, especially research on mental health services, dominates the field. By contrast, basic research on social psychiatric issues is underrepresented. Studies using qualitative methods are almost missing. While, as traditionally, the research interest is still particularly focussed on schizophrenia, there are a number of papers dealing with other disorders, mainly with substance abuse disorders and affective disorders.\nThe critique raised by Finzen is to a large extent supported by the results of our study.

Changes in how studies are designed, reviewed by ethics boards, conducted, and reported in the literature have created a need for a systematic approach to teaching psychiatric research ethics to clinical researchers in training. The purpose of this article is to describe a model curriculum and comprehensive background reading list for training in psychiatric research bioethics. The curriculum was designed as an interactive seminar in a research fellowship program but can be adapted and incorporated into existing medical school and psychiatry residency training curricula. Participants in the seminar provide formal and informal evaluations of each session and the seminar as a whole. The seminar, now in it's third year, has been regularly attended and highly regarded by the NIMH research fellows who have participated. In response to recommendations by the participants, the content and organization of the seminar has been modified. Clinical research is both scientifically and ethically complex. Our initial experience with a formal curriculum in psychiatric research bioethics suggests that this educational activity has been both meaningful and relevant for psychiatrists training to be clinical investigators."}, {"Title": "Consultation-liaison psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine: the company they keep.", "Abstract": "The objectives of this review are 1) to briefly describe the parallel historical developments of consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine [corrected]; 2) to analyze the extent to which the literature of C-L psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine relate to each other, given that both fields have evolved simultaneously in the history of psychiatry; and 3) to propose possible explanations for observed publication patterns in selected C-L resources and the journal Psychosomatic Medicine.\nThe quasi-citation analysis includes two segments: 1) a review of selected key C-L psychiatry references to determine the extent to which classic articles from Psychosomatic Medicine are cited; and 2) an analysis of 60 years of Psychosomatic Medicine, sampling issues from the first 5 years of each decade and all issues of the year 2000 for articles of potential relevance to C-L psychiatry. References to Psychosomatic Medicine articles in C-L resources are tallied as percentages of total references in each source. Articles in Psychosomatic Medicine are assigned to one of three categories (A, B, or C) according to their perceived relevance to C-L psychiatry, from most (A) to least (C) relevant.\nThe review of C-L sources (\"basic\" reading lists and reference lists of seminal articles and textbooks) revealed a wide range of Psychosomatic Medicine citations, from 0% to 27.4% (average, 7.5%). The survey of Psychosomatic Medicine sorted 1705 articles for their relevance to C-L psychiatry into category A (9.5-40.6%, average 21.3%), category B (70.4-86.3%, average 72.3%), and category C (0.7-12.1%, average 6.4%) for each half-decade for the past 60 years. The lowest number of category A articles appeared in the years 1970 to 1975, and the highest number appeared in 1950 to 1955; reciprocal results were found for category B articles. The lowest number of category C articles appeared in 1980 to 1985, and the highest number appeared in 1940 to 1945. For the six issues of 2000, the distributions of articles in categories A, B, and C are similar, continuing an upward trend beginning in 1975 of core (category A) articles. Explanations for publication patterns are speculatively related to various factors, such as a paucity of C-L research and researchers, the broad definition of C-L psychiatry, editorial policies, and the impact of World War II.\nAlthough C-L psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine have common roots, the reliance of the C-L literature on classic Psychosomatic Medicine articles has varied markedly, from none to about one-quarter of its references. Nevertheless, Psychosomatic Medicine has consistently published articles of theoretical and clinical interest to C-L psychiatrists, with more than 90% of published articles considered to be of high or moderate relevance to C-L psychiatry. A far higher percentage of articles in Psychosomatic Medicine would seem to be relevant to the field of C-L psychiatry than are cited in significant C-L literature. Psychosomatic Medicine's essential focus on empirical research may dissuade the more clinically oriented C-L psychiatrists."}, {"Title": "Symptomatic approach to posttraumatic headache and its possible implications for treatment.", "Abstract": "We investigated 112 patients [mean age 39.5 +/- 10.5 years, 59% women (n=66)] with chronic posttraumatic headache following cranio-cervical acceleration/deceleration trauma after an average time interval of 2.5 +/- 1.9 years from trauma. Headache following minor head injury or whiplash is one of the most prominent problems in neurotraumatology. Previous research is inconclusive regarding the symptomatic approach of this type of headache. Details of the phenomenology of posttraumatic headache in the previous literature are inconclusive. This may lead to inappropriate treatment strategies, because recent advances in therapy of different headache types may be neglected. Patients were investigated at the outpatient service of the Department of Psychiatry. Headache was analyzed according to its principal location, laterality, projection, quality, precipitation or aggravation and possible additional symptoms. For this analysis, headache was diagnosed according to the classification of the International Headache Society. The results showed that 42 patients (37%) had tension-type headache, 30 (27%) were identified as suffering from migraine, whereas 20 patients (18%) had cervicogenic headache. An additional 18% of patients suffered from headache that did not fulfill criteria of a particular category. In 104 patients (93%), neck pain was associated in time with headache. Each of the diagnosed headache types in this study may require specific treatment strategies based upon empirical studies of non-traumatic headache types. For these reasons a detailed analysis of headache following cranio-cervical acceleration/deceleration trauma is necessary."}, {"Title": "[A study of patients with anorexia nervosa in Gavleborg.

Until then it had been considered a female disease only. A number of studies have reported a rather poor outcome for boys and men. In a Danish study infertility was noted in affected men. The aim of this study is to describe typical arrays of clinical data in order to assess attitudes and values concerning the effect of treatment on 28 teenagers out of a total of 48 children and adolescents. A sociometric questionnaire was used to assess the youngsters' knowledge of their disease, their opinions concerning the competence of staff, their feelings concerning treatment, including parental involvement in therapy and medications used, as well as their opinions concerning the results of treatment. All boys are alive (in 1999), 19 years after falling ill. The boys were much more reluctant to accept inpatient care than were the girls, who seem to show greater autonomy. Participants' final appraisal of treatment is slightly positive, whereas in the hypothetical situation that a friend might fall ill with an eating disorder, a sizeable majority would recommend contact with child psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Child and adolescent psychiatric aspects of expertising on children suffering from impediments in learning or mental perceptien].", "Abstract": "Based on the efforts by the legislator to standardize the law for disabled persons and to simplify the accesses to appropriate assistance, procedures of expert reports are exemplarily presented from the aspect of child and adolescent psychiatry.

Public institutions, such as schools or kindergartens more often are not only support but a substitute for family structures. Individual medical care being guaranteed, seeking for prevention and treatment and health status differ widely according to sociological patterns. Health care and social compensation programmes on a multiprofessional basis will thus be accessible only in a very general sense to all youth at the public institution of a school. Besides all the general public health programmes in schools, medical expertise on an individual level is becoming more and more important because of the increasing number of classes integrating diseased and disabled children in regular school. The public school health services will not only act as individual medical experts themselves but more as coordinators of all medical and health promoting efforts on an administrative, school, inpatient and outpatient level. Medical professionals working in public school health services will therefore have to be trained in the following spheres: normal range of developmental milestones, knowledge of health systems and regional structures of health care, epidemiological basics, communicative and social training, clinical expertise in the fields of general paediatrics, child psychiatry and occupational health. Being fully trained in clinical paediatrics and public health will surely be an asset, but will not cover all the requirements for successfully working in school health care. For this reason the programmes of higher education in public health have to be adjusted to the recent demands in this special field of work. School health services will have to engage in occupational health and will have to be present mostly in the school buildings proper. School health services will have to report and publish epidemiological data for use by school, community and medical professionals. In case of continued compulsory medical examination of schoolbeginners wide use should be made of qualified assistant personnel, so that physicians can focus on true medical problems in school and moreover will be enabled to deliver medical expertise and treatment within the community to people and population groups in need."}, {"Title": "The epidemiology and significance of autoimmune diseases in health care.", "Abstract": "Autoimmune diseases are conditions in which the immune system damages normal components of the individual.

These include, among others, the great variety and worldwide distribution of these conditions, the clinical importance of some of these diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, the antiphospholipid syndrome, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome or systemic sclerosis, or the relationship between autoimmunity and virus infections, atherosclerosis, malignancy and Psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Carbamazepine reduces memory induced activation of mesial temporal lobe structures: a pharmacological fMRI-study.", "Abstract": "It is not known whether carbamazepine (CBZ; a drug widely used in neurology and psychiatry) influences the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast changes induced by neuronal activation and measured by functional MRI (fMRI). We aimed to investigate the influence of CBZ on memory induced activation of the mesial temporal lobes in patients with symptomatic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).\nTwenty-one individual patients with refractory symptomatic TLE with different CBZ serum levels and 20 healthy controls were studied using BOLD fMRI. Mesial temporal lobe (MTL) activation was induced by a task that is based on the retrieval of individually familiar visuo-spatial knowledge. The extent of significant MTL fMRI activation was measured and correlated with the CBZ serum level.\nIn TLE patients, the extent of significant fMRI activation over both MTL was negatively correlated to the CBZ serum level (Spearman r = -0.654, P < 0.001). Activation over the supposedly normal MTL, i.e. contralateral to the seizure onset of TLE patients, was smaller than the averaged MTL activation in healthy controls (P < 0.005). Age, duration of epilepsy, side of seizure onset, and intelligence were not correlated to the extent of the significant BOLD-response over both MTL in patients with TLE.\nIn TLE patients, carbamazepine reduces the fMRI-detectable changes within the mesial temporal lobes as induced by effortful memory retrieval.

Amongst symptoms and signs associated with depression, it is seen as having high predictive validity, correlating with severity of illness and the outcome of numerous therapeutic interventions. Of the two components-\"psycho\" and \"motor\"-the psychological component has received the most thorough investigation and has been given the greatest consideration. The \"motor\" (or motion) component has been given little consideration. A review of the literature suggests few studies have attempted to quantitatively characterize this phenomenon or use it as anything more than one indice among other signs and symptoms of depression. Unlike other phenomena associated with depression, the use of motion alterations has lagged in significance due to limited technology that would allow its study; depression has been seen predominantly as a \" mood\" disorder, with principal interest being in the \"feelings\" associated with the disorder. Recent advances in motion capture technologies allow motion alterations to be used for many purposes, both quantitative and qualitative. These sources of information appear to have direct and indirect impact. There is a fertile future for motion capture constructs in the study of depression,and recent technological advances will allow progress to occur in this area."}, {"Title": "Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interactions in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "The psychostimulants methylphenidate, amphetamine and pemoline are among the most common medications used today in child and adolescent psychiatry for the treatment of patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Frequently, these medications are used in combination with other medications on a short or long term basis. The present review examines psychostimulant pharmacology, summarises reported drug-drug interactions and explores underlying pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations for interactions. A computerised search was undertaken using Medline (1966 to 2000) and Current Contents to provide the literature base for reports of drug-drug interactions involving psychostimulants. These leads were further cross-referenced for completeness of the survey. Methylphenidate appears to be more often implicated in pharmacokinetic interactions suggestive of possible metabolic inhibition, although the mechanisms still remain unclear. Amphetamine was more often involved in apparent pharmacodynamic interactions and could potentially be influenced by medications affecting cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. No published reports of drug interactions involving pemoline were found. The alpha2-adrenergic agonists clonidine and guanfacine have been implicated in several interactions. Perhaps best documented is their antagonism by tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines. In additional, concurrent beta-blocker use, or abrupt discontinuation, can lead to hypertensive response. Although there are few published well-controlled interaction studies with psychostimulants and alpha2-adrenergic agonists, it appears that these agents may be safely coadministered. The interactions of monoamine oxidase inhibitors with psychostimulants represent one of the few strict contraindications."}, {"Title": "Abdominal stab wounds: diagnostic peritoneal lavage criteria for emergency room discharge.", "Abstract": "To prospectively evaluate a method for management of abdominal stab wounds that allows for immediate emergency room discharge.\nAnterior abdominal stab wound patients were prospectively placed in a study trial during a 48-month period. Consent was obtained for all patients before study entry. Anatomic boundaries for abdominal stab wounds were costal margins, inguinal ligaments, and anterior axillary lines. Hemodynamically stable patients with negative physical examinations were entered in the study and evaluated with closed diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL). Patients with DPL results less than 1000 RBCs/mm3 were sent home. Patients with DPL results greater than 1000 RBCs/mm3 (including gross blood) were admitted for observation. Hemodynamically stable patients with evisceration and no abdominal tenderness had the viscera replaced in the emergency room. Eviscerated patients did not undergo DPL and were admitted for observation. Patients that presented with hemodynamic instability or peritonitis were not entered in the study and underwent immediate surgical intervention.\nNinety hemodynamically stable patients were entered in the study. Forty-four (49%) patients had DPL < 1000 RBCs/mm3, 34 of which were discharged home.

Consequently, pharmacogenetics has also gained an increasing interest in psychiatry. Recent exciting findings seem to suggest that the growing interest in regulatory regions of candidate genes and neurotransmitters metabolism, together with the application of sophisticated molecular approaches, may offer new opportunities in neuropsychopharmacology. Indeed, quantitative variation of gene expression and/or of neurotransmitters metabolism could better explain both psychopathology and clinical response to psychotropic drugs. Three functional polymorphisms, and their possible relationship with clinical variables, are discussed. The first is the 44-bp insertion/deletion reported in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene. A functional repeat polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene encoding for the enzyme monoamine oxidase A represents the second example. The last is a functional polymorphism within the coding region of the gene encoding for the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase"}, {"Title": "Is the randomized clinical trial the gold standard of research?", "Abstract": "All research has flaws. Some flaws are so trivial that the research can still stand as the definitive study. Other flaws prevent a study from being definitive, but the study still provides useful guidance in the context of other research. Some flaws are so serious that the research provides no useful information at all. The tricky part is not finding flaws in the research but in deciding to what extent the flaws erode the credibility of the research. In general, the use of RCTs can add substantial credibility to a research study. There are calls for greater use of RCTs in many areas, such as surgery (Baum, 1999) and psychiatry (Andrews, 1999). Of course, nonrandomized trials are an important complement to RCTs when the latter are ethically inappropriate or logistically impossible (Black, 1996). Failure to use randomization or blinding, however, is not a fatal flaw. Furthermore, the artificial nature of RCTs will often restrict their applicability to overly simple interventions. When RCTs focus on narrow patient groups or exclude important segments of the population, there may be difficulty in generalizing their results. So it would be a mistake to label the RCT as a gold standard for all research. A silver standard may be a more appropriate label."}, {"Title": "Child maltreatment in the \"children of the nineties\" a longitudinal study of parental risk factors.", "Abstract": "To identify and validate factors within the parental background affecting risk of child maltreatment.\nA nested case-control study based on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (\"Children of the Nineties\"), a cohort of children born in Avon in 1991 through 1992. Data on the childhood and psychiatric histories of the parents, along with other data on the social and family environments, have been collected through postal questionnaires from early antenatal booking onwards.\nOut of 14,138 participating children, 162 have been identified as having been maltreated. Using logistic regression analysis, significant risk factors within the mothers' backgrounds were age < 20; lower educational achievement; history of sexual abuse; child guidance or psychiatry; absence of her father during childhood; and a previous history of psychiatric illness. Significant factors in the fathers' backgrounds were age < 20; lower educational achievement; having been in care during childhood; and a history of psychiatric illness. Significant factors on univariate, but not multivariate analysis included a parental history of childhood physical abuse; divorce or separation of the mother's parents; a maternal history of having been in care, or separated from her mother; parental alcohol or drug abuse; and a maternal history of depression.\nThis study, the first of its kind in the UK, supports the findings of others that parental age, educational achievement, and a history of psychiatric illness are of prime importance in an understanding of child maltreatment. With the exception of maternal sexual abuse, a history of abuse in childhood is not significant once adjusted for other background factors.

Disturbances of declarative memory are common following posterior cerebral artery and thalamic strokes. Abulia can follow thalamic, caudate and capsular lesions. Intraventricular and subarachnoid haemorrhages can cause preeminent neuropsychological changes. Disorientation is present in about 40% of acute stroke patients and delirium complicates the course of 25% of acute strokes. Some hyperacute cognitive stroke syndromes are useful indicators of later disability.

This work has emerged from a broader study which seeks to examine shifts and continuities in the experiences of mental illness from the introduction of the NHS to the present day, through a study of Oxfordshire. Psychiatry itself and the historiography of psychiatry have in many ways silenced the patient or service user. Nevertheless, acceptable means of communication have always existed, and these are revealed through patients' narratives. In-depth analysis of 21 interviews with patients has led to the emergence of three key acceptable narratives or narrative frames, these being: stories of loss, tales of survival and self-discovery, and narratives of the self as patient. Through examination of three key frames by which patients and users have understood and presented their illness experiences, this article seeks to trace the interactions between the general and the particular, the social and the individual, and to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the recent history of mental health and illness."}, {"Title": "Use of music therapy and other ITNIs in acute care.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this descriptive study was to examine the clinical use of music therapy as an independent therapeutic nursing intervention (ITNI) in acute inpatient settings. This study identified the frequency, rationale, and perceived effectiveness of its use as an ITNI. In addition, barriers and facilitators to nurses' use of music therapy were identified. Frequency of use of other ITNIs also were investigated. An author-designed questionnaire, based on the literature and reviewed by a panel of experts, was used to survey a convenience sample (N = 321) of RNs at an acute inpatient facility with more than 50 beds, located in the midwestern United States. One hundred thirty-five RNs (42%) participated in the study. Findings indicated that 85.2% (n = 115) of respondents knew of music therapy, with 69.6% (n = 94) of them reporting using it in practice. Of the other listed ITNIs, deep breathing was used most frequently, followed by therapeutic touch and massage. Music therapy was used most commonly to reduce anxiety and was ranked as the ITNI used most often to enhance sleep and decrease distraction, agitation, aggression, and depression. Psychiatry/chemical dependency and intensive care units had the highest incidence of use of music therapy. The ranking of barriers and facilitators identified the strongest barrier as not having time to help patients with music therapy, whereas the strongest facilitator was nurses' comfort with the idea of using music therapy. This research begins to fill an information gap about the frequency, purpose, and perceived effectiveness of use of ITNIs. The use of ITNIs can increase patient comfort and facilitate conservation of energy, which aids healing processes, as described in Levine's Conservation Model. Use of ITNIs also can empower nurses and facilitate their control over nursing practice. This study indicates that nurses need further education on the use of music therapy and other ITNIs."}, {"Title": "Sympathetic surgery for psychiatry.

To assess the role of genetic influences in ADHD, we used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify subtypes of ADHD taking into account its comorbidity with separation anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and three major depression symptoms. A structured interview was used to collect diagnostic data from a population sample of 2,904 adolescent female twins and their parents. LCA was applied to ADHD. separation anxiety. ODD symptom profiles obtained from the twins' parents, and major depression symptom profiles obtained from the twins' self-report. Odds ratios were used to test for familiality of class membership by examining the effect of zygosity on twin concordance within and between latent classes. Structural equation modeling was used to compute heritabilities for latent class membership. LCA revealed three ADHD categories of clinical interest: an inattentive subtype without comorbidity, a second inattentive subtype with increased number of ODD symptoms. and a combined inattentive/hyperactive-impulsive type with elevated levels of ODD, separation anxiety, and depressive symptoms. LCA also distinguished an ODD class and a separation anxiety class, each without increased levels of other comorbid symptoms; a second ODD class co-occurring with increased separation anxiety and depression symptoms; and a pure depression class. Odds ratios for MZ contrasted with DZ twin concordance for individual latent class membership ranged from 2.5 to 19.4. Overall, 66% of MZ pairs, but only 36% of DZ pairs, were assigned to the same latent class, consistent with a genetic hypothesis for latent class membership. Individual class membership was shown to have high heritability ranging from .34-.85. The pattern of latent classes suggested that in the general female adolescent population, there are three highly heritable ADHD subtypes, two of which are comorbid with other disorders. These classes were consistent with a genetic hypothesis for ADHD, with each class potentially reflecting a unique genetic subtype."}, {"Title": "Antipsychotic drugs: prolonged QTc interval, torsade de pointes, and sudden death.", "Abstract": "The authors review the mechanisms and establish the risk of torsade de pointes and sudden death with antipsychotic drugs.\nThey present a review of original concepts, the distinction between familial and drug-induced cases of torsade de pointes, and the recognition of the role of noncardiac drugs in torsade de pointes and sudden death. They review the evidence linking QTc interval prolongation, potassium channels, and torsade de pointes from both the long QT syndrome and drugs. They examine the risk for torsade de pointes from antipsychotic drugs and estimate the frequency of sudden death on the basis of epidemiological data in normal and schizophrenic populations.\nAll drugs that cause torsade de pointes prolong the QTc interval and bind to the potassium rectifier channel, but the relationships are not precise. Prediction of torsade de pointes and sudden death can be improved by examining dose dependency, the percent of QTc intervals higher than 500 msec, and the risk of drug-drug interactions. Although sudden unexpected death occurs almost twice as often in populations treated with antipsychotics as in normal populations, there are still only 10-15 such events in 10,000 person-years of observation.\nAlthough pimozide, sertindole, droperidol, and haloperidol have been documented to cause torsade de pointes and sudden death, the most marked risk is with thioridazine. There is no association with olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone. Ziprasidone does prolong the QT interval, but there is no evidence to suggest that this leads to torsade de pointes or sudden death. Only widespread use will prove if ziprasidone is entirely safe. To date, all antipsychotic drugs have the potential for serious adverse events. Balancing these risks with the positive effects of treatment poses a challenge for psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[On the impact of disorder-specific versus general psychotherapy from the psychiatric viewpoint].", "Abstract": "Concerning the discussion of disorder-specific versus general psychotherapy it has to be taken into consideration that institutional aspects in psychiatry as well as the definition of adequate outcome criteria are specific for different subgroups of patients.

Medication that is used in this context requires the properties of rapid onset of effect (tranquillisation or at least initial sedation in order to quell aggressive or disorganised behaviour, but also antipsychotic effect), low frequency of administration and low levels of side effects, such as cardiological or neurological side effects, or pain at the injection site. Zuclopenthixol is the cis(Z)-isomer of clopenthixol, a neuroleptic of the thioxanthene group, used for treating people with psychotic symptoms. There is one oral preparation and two depot forms: zuclopenthixol acetate and zuclopenthixol decanoate. The acetate version does not stay in the body for very long (a single dose persists for only 72 hours) and is said to have these properties.\nTo estimate the effectiveness of zuclopenthixol acetate for the acute treatment of serious mental illnesses in comparison to other neuroleptic drugs.\nSearches of Current Controlled Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com - accessed 5.10.2000), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials (January 2001), the Cochrane Library (1997, CD-ROM, issue 2), MEDLINE (1966-1997) were supplemented by appeals for unpublished data to the research community and to the Medical Information Department of Lundbeck Limited. Attempts were made to contact relevant authors.\nTwo reviewers independently assessed citations or papers and selected all randomised trials that included people with serious mental illnesses and compared zuclopenthixol acetate with other drug regimes.\nTwo reviewers extracted data independently. Attempts were made to contact authors for additional or missing information. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for binary data. Where possible, OR were pooled using Peto method and intention-to-treat analysis undertaken. Mean differences were used for continuous variables.\nPooled data show no difference for the outcome 'no important improvement' in psychotic symptoms at the end of the follow-up period (OR 0.84 CI 0.34-2.05). Sedation was evaluated using different instruments. Only one study presented data which suggested an earlier and more intense sedation in zuclopenthixol acetate users at four hours (OR 0.18 CI 0.04-0.93). Use of additional antipsychotic medication was not avoided in the zuclopenthixol acetate group (OR 2.18, CI 0.64-7.42) and data on total number of administrations were not obtainable. Side effect data were poorly reported but there is no evidence of a consistent difference between zuclopenthixol acetate and other 'standard drugs' for either the pattern of side effects or the wish to leave the study early. Hospital and service outcomes, number of aggressive incidents, satisfaction with care and economic outcomes were not addressed by any study.\nRecommendations on the use of zuclopenthixol acetate for the management of psychiatric emergencies in preference to 'standard' treatment have to be viewed with caution. Most trials present important methodological flaws and findings are poorly reported. This review did not find any suggestion that zuclopenthixol acetate is more effective in controlling aggressive/disorganised behaviour, acute psychotic symptoms, or preventing side effects. There were no data directly related to tranquillisation, but it may produce more earlier and intense sedation than oral haloperidol. Well-conducted randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm claims related to the use of zuclopenthixol acetate in emergency psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Alpha-interferon and mental disorders].", "Abstract": "The interferon alpha stands as a reference both in oncology and virology. But its efficiency is limited by frequent somatic as well as neuropsychic side effects. As a matter of fact, the reduction or the ending of a chemotherapy treatment come chiefly from the psychiatric complications caused by the use of interferon. For about 30% of patients, various psychic disorders are noticed: personality disorders, mood disorders, anxiety states, suicidal tendencies, manic and psychotic symptoms. We thus propose a review which shall be completed by a discussion on wether the interferon is responsible or not of the appearance of the described mental disorders. We shall conclude with a synthesis of the proposed practical management when confronted with such disorders. Psychiatric complications under interferon-Alpha. The appearance of psychiatric complications caused by interferon has been the subject of many publications. They have also raised the question of the toxicity mechanism which is still misunderstood today. This toxicity appears to be dose-dependent with variations depending on the daily dose given, the mode of administration, the combination with other chemotherapy treatments, the concomitance with a cerebral radiotherapy or a medical history of psychiatric disorders. Most of these effects occur after three weeks of treatment but non specific neuropsychic symptoms can be observed earlier. Non specific symptoms. They appear early but are difficult to detect, though they bring together a whole lot of clinical signs: asthenia, irritability, psychomotor slowdown, depressive mood or even a real \"subsyndromic\" depressive syndrome, anorexia, decline of the libido, concentration and attention problems, dizzy spells and headaches. Some authors have described intense and fluctuating of personality, mixing anxiety, irritability and disorder of drive control. Depression. Depression is the most frequently found psychiatric pathology in studies but the real frequency of clear cases of depressive problems is difficult to determine through lack of serious studies. So the incidence of depressive disorders usually varies from 5 to 15%. The depressive syndrome can settle as soon as the first week treatment, with a peak in the frequency during the first and third months. The seriousness and the incidence of this syndrome seem to be dose-dependent. The gravity of this complication lies in the suicidal risk, a risk all the more dreadful since there is not any identified risk factor. Suicides and suicidal behaviours. Serious complications, because they act directly on the vital prognosis. However fortunately, suicidal behaviours only represent a minority within all the side effects attributed to the interferon-alpha. These actions fit into three main clinical dimensions: complication of a severe depressive syndrome, confusional context and disorder of the impulses control. In practical terms, prevention proves to be difficult without identified predictive factors. Nevertheless, some authors point out the importance of aggravating comorbid disorders like alcoholism or the coinfection by the HIV. Manic syndrome. The appearance of a manic state under a chemotherapy treatment seems to be rare, given that there have been only a dozen cases published around the world. But these observations are interesting as far as both the study of imputability and the understanding of the toxicity mechanisms are concerned. Most of the cases deal with patients without a family or personal history of psychiatric disorders, and whose symptomatology disappears with the end of the treatment, which is an argument in favour of the imputation of the interferon in the appearance of manic disorders. In addition, some authors introduce the notion of tertiary mania: the appearance of an autoimmune hypothyroidism in relation with interferon and leading to athymic elation. Eventually, the appearance of manic problems at the end of the treatment makes it possible to speculate about the physiopathological mechanisms that are at issue. Anxiety disorders. These disorders are not much described: they generally are already existing disorders (like phobic or obsessive compulsive disorders), reactivated or aggravated by the interferon-alpha molecule. Adaptation disorders. It deals with adaptation disorders along with anxious temper coming at the beginning of the treatment. These problems are more concerned with the announcement of the diagnosis and its seriousness than with the toxicity of the interferon-alpha molecule. Psychotic states. There are less papers on the prevalence of psychotic disorders during the treatment, or at the end of it. But they can be found in both viral and malignant pathologies. A large retrospective study has shown ten cases of psychotic disorders and that in the absence of history of psychiatry or of a HIV co-infection. In every case the psychiatric aspect is stopped by the ending of the treatment or by an appropriated treatment. Usually, the few cases of parano\u00efd delusion described in papers seem to appear between one and three months of treatment, with patients having a history of psychiatric disorders. Aggravation of pre-existing mental disorders. Numerous authors have reported the recurrence of addictive behaviours (alcohol or other psychoactive matter) by weaned patients. Imputability to interferon-alpha in psychiatric disorders. It is difficult to draw the relationship between the chemotherapy with the interferon-alpha treatment and neuropsychiatric complications because there is a lack in specific studies. Nevertheless, it seems to be causal relations between the prescription of interferon and the appearance of psychic disorders. As a matter of fact, even if there is neither predictive criterion nor diagnosis of clinical type (set apart a dose effect), it is clear that there are diagnostic criteria of chronological kind: delay of appearance and disappearance of side effects compatible with the kinetics of the molecule and test of positive reintroduction. The imputability is thus most likely towards, given the reported clinical observations and signs of direct cerebral toxicity described for interferon: induction of neurophysiological changes among healthy volunteers, reversible EEG impairments the second week of treatment, direct vascular and neurological toxicity. Eventually, authors have shown that the psychiatric morbidity could be more important among patients under treatment than in a control group. In conclusion, the imputability of interferon appears to be very likely, more particularly in the appearance of mood disorders, mainly depressive ones, of manic syndromes and of certain psychotic episodes.\nThe most numerous therapeutic propositions naturally concern the depressive syndromes, because of their high frequency. In a recent article, the authors have detailed the pharmacological criteria of the ideal molecule: limited hepatic metabolism, low rate of proteinic fixation, long half-life and absence of active metabolite. So they advise not to prescribe imipraminic molecules and recommend the use of some SRI in first intention: citalopram and sertraline mainly, paroxetine to avoid given its pharmacological features that do not seem adapted. Only the minalcipram seems to show all the theoretical advantages described above. If there is an indication in the introduction of an anxiolytic medication, we shall prefer a benzodiazepine with short half-life like loxazepam and alprazolam. Besides, all the publications point out the importance of a specific clinical observation during the treatment as well as in the six months following its end. The agreement must bear full medical costs, above all including psychotherapic and social aspects. The proposed treatments for the other disorders are conventional: haloperidol and lithium for bipolar disorders, fluvoxamine for obsessive compulsive disorders and neuroleptics for psychotic disorders.\nThe appearance of neuropsychiatric side effects during a chemotherapy using the interferon-alpha molecule is a frequent complication, the consequences of which can prove tragic: involvement of the vital prognosis, family and professional relation disturbances, compliance problems, risks of psychiatric morbidity at short and middle terms.... In spite of the absence of rigorous controlled studies, the imputability to the interferon of the appearance of psychological disorders appears very likely. So the role of the psychiatrist seems to be determining in the follow-up care of these patients who must be considered at high risk to develop a psychiatric pathology. The agreement to bear medical costs has to be made in narrow collaboration with clinical practitioners and must be part of a clinical continuity, from the pre-therapeutical evaluation to the remote follow-up care. Finally, it seems important to implement controlled studies, resting on a great diagnostic and methodological rigour, in order to clarify the toxicity mechanisms of interferon and to optimise the agreement to bear medical cost for the patients."}, {"Title": "A multicenter Italian study of patients' relatives' beliefs about schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "This study explored patients' relatives' beliefs about schizophrenia in Italy, a country with a long history of community-based psychiatry. The study was conducted among 709 key relatives of patients with schizophrenia who were recruited in 30 mental health departments. Relatives seemed to believe that mental hospitals are not appropriate places in which to treat their loved ones, even though most of them felt that they were alone in coping with the burden of their ill relative's disease. Most of the relatives agreed that people who have schizophrenia should be allowed to vote, but they appeared to have a stricter attitude toward affective rights, such as the patient's right to get married and have children, and tended to perceive their loved ones as being subject to social discrimination.

Two related neuropeptides (Hcrt-1/OXA, Hcrt-2/OXB) encoded by the same precursor gene and two G-protein coupled receptors (Hcrtr1/OXR1, Hcrtr2/OXR2) are currently known. Hypocretin-containing cells are discretely localized within the perifornical hypothalamus but have widespread projections, with generally excitatory postsynaptic effects. Dense excitatory projections to all monoaminergic cell groups have been reported. A major emerging function for this system is likely to be the regulation of sleep. Alterations in hypocretin neurotransmission causes the sleep disorder narcolepsy in mice, dogs and humans. Effects on appetite, neuroendocrine and energy metabolism regulation are also suggested by other studies. Hypocretins are uniquely positioned to link sleep, appetite and neuroendocrine control, three behaviors of major importance in psychiatry. The potential role of this system in regulating the sleep cycle, modulating wakefulness at selected circadian times and in mediating the deleterious effects of sleep deprivation is discussed."}, {"Title": "The search for meaning: eventfulness in the lives of homeless mentally ill persons in the Skid Row district of Los Angeles.", "Abstract": "In the past two decades, the field of psychiatry has seen the once dominant psychoanalytic theories overtaken by biological explanations and approaches to severe mental illness.

However, to date, no studies have been conducted to assess the efficacy of fluoxetine or any other SSRI medication in adolescents with major depression in combination with an alcohol use disorder (AUD). In this study, the authors investigated whether fluoxetine decreases the depressive symptoms and the drinking of adolescents with comorbid major depression and an AUD. The authors conducted a 12-week open-label study of fluoxetine (20 mg) in 13 adolescents with current comorbid major depression and an AUD. A significant within-group decrease (improvement) was found for both depressive symptoms and drinking during the course of the study. The fluoxetine was well tolerated during the study.

While this approach is excellent for studying system or clinical performance, it is not well suited to answering questions concerning whether systems will be used or how they will be used. Because lack of use of CDSS has been of concern for some years, other evaluation research designs are needed to address those issues. This paper critiques RCT and experimental evaluation approaches and presents alternative approaches to evaluation that address questions outside the scope of the usual RCT and experimental designs. A wide range of literature is summarized to illustrate the value of evaluations that take into account social, organizational, professional, and other contextual considerations. Many of these studies go beyond the usual measures of systems performance or physicians' behavior by focusing on 'fit' of the system with other aspects of professional and organizational life. Because there is little explicit theory that informs many evaluations, the paper then reviews CDSS evaluations informed by social science theories. Lastly, it proposes a theoretical social science base of social interactionism. An example of such an approach is given. It involves a CDSS in psychiatry and is based on Kaplan's 4Cs, which focus on communication, control, care, and context. Although the example is a CDSS, the evaluation approach also is useful for clinical guideline implementation and other medical informatics applications. Similarly, although the discussion is about social interactionism, the more important point is the need to broaden evaluation through a variety of methods and approaches that investigate social, cultural, organizational, cognitive, and other contextual concerns. Methodological pluralism and a variety of research questions can increase understanding of many influences concerning informatics applications development and deployment."}, {"Title": "[Use of the critical incident technique in the development of a measurement tool for satisfaction in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Health care centers will have to set up a regular survey of their patients' satisfaction, in addition to the discharge questionnaire.

From the late 1970s to the 1990s, it became apparent that various medications possessed wider therapeutic profiles than were previously recognized.

Despite the high prevalence, with estimates of approximately 10,000 women suffering annually from postnatal psychiatric disturbances in Austria, there has been a lack of medical attendance for these women and their children.

These departments were asked about the possibility of conjoint mother-child-admission, and their experiences with this form of admission; 23 departments (74.2%) provided information. A total of 12 departments responded that they theoretically accepted mothers with their babies; however, they also indicated that until now these conjoint admissions had been performed only very rarely or not at all.

In Halle, Wernicke found not only a well-functioning clinical institution but also an important neurobiological tradition inaugurated by Eduard Hitzig. He immediately resumed his research programme. Fields of interest included the implementation of his nosological system in clinical practice, the study of aetiological factors of mental diseases and the use of a new method of puncture for the localisation of brain tumours.

This phenomenon represents a significant problem for both the patient and the therapeutic team, as it is a factor which reduces motivation. While several studies confirm a positive shift of early drop-out behavior with the aid of methadone-supported detoxification, the overall drop-out rate still saw no improvement. Unexpectedly the latter rate was found to be around 50 %. The aim of the present study was to determine the sociodemographic, dispositional and addiction-related factors, as well as subjective ratings of the present state, which have predictive value, i. e. which could discriminate drop-outs from those patients who bring their detoxification to a regular end. 176 patients from two different clinical detoxification wards of the Hannover Clinic of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy participated in the study. The overall drop-out rate was 49.4 %, the rate of female patients failing to conclude detoxification was significantly higher than that of males (68.4 % vs. 44.2 %). On average drop-out patients were 2.2 years younger and their former (i. e. uninterrupted) periods without drug consumption were shorter, while criminal circumstances (e. g. therapy as probation vs. voluntary participation) did not play a major role in influencing staying power. As expected, patients terminating their treatment against medical advice evaluated the therapeutic program more critically than the others. Interestingly drop outs rated their own mental and somatic condition very pessimistic.

We examined the effectiveness of CBT in a general hospital setting in a retrospective questionnaire follow-up study of 94 patients offered CBT by liaison psychiatry services. The questionnaire response rate was 61%. Eighteen percent had returned to normal functioning at follow-up. For the group as a whole, there was a significant improvement in the functional and social impairment and the number of frequently experienced symptoms. Those in work or study at follow-up was 53% (29% pretreatment), and 65% of patients mentioned occupational stress as a contributory factor in their illness. There was a significant reduction in the frequency of attendance at primary care in the year after the end of CBT. We conclude that cognitive behavioral therapy is an acceptable treatment for most patients and can be used in a general hospital outpatient setting by a variety of trained therapists. However, a proportion of patients do not benefit and remain significantly disabled by the condition."}, {"Title": "A comparison of symptom provocation procedures in psychiatry and other areas of medicine: implications for their ethical use in research.", "Abstract": "Symptom provocation is used to study a wide variety of medical disorders. In contrast to other areas of medicine, the application of these procedures to the study of mental disease has generated significant scientific, political, and public debate. Purported differences include an overabundance of these procedures in psychiatry and a lack of diagnostic and therapeutic utility. Accurate appraisal of these research designs is needed to address scientific merit and ethical concerns. This article provides a general review of challenge studies in several areas of medical research, compares purposes and methods to those used in psychiatry, and ascertains whether fundamental differences exist.\nIn total, 655 challenge studies were identified using MEDLINE and PsychInfo Boolean key word searches. Information was collected from each study including the year of publication, whether subjects were healthy or patient volunteers, the disease being studied, and the study purpose (e.g., to study pathophysiology, test treatment efficacy, or diagnosis of a disorder).\nDifferences in study design, purpose, and frequency of studies across time were similar for medical and psychiatric diseases.\nGiven extensive similarity in purpose and procedures, why are psychiatric challenge studies being subjected to public criticism and special review and approval procedures? Several relevant issues are addressed including risk, scientific merit, and clinical application."}, {"Title": "[Familial Alzheimer's disease connected with mutation in presenilin gene 1 (P117L)].", "Abstract": "We describe a Polish family with Alzheimer's disease in some of its members. Two sisters were observed and examined--also neuropathologically in the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw. The disease onset was in our patients at 32 and 33 years. The first symptoms were memory loss and disorientation. Later on myoclonus and extrapyramidal stiffness were noted in both cases. Neurovisualizing examinations performed in both sisters showed diffuse brain atrophy. The symptoms increased rapidly and in short time (several months) the patients became mute and bedbound. They died at age 35 and 37 years. We were informed that the father of the patients suffered from very similar illness and died at age of 37 years and their older brother had the some symptoms and died at the age of 28 years. Post-mortem brain examination disclosed in the both hospitalized cases diffuse atrophy of the cerebral hemispheres, particularly severe in the temporal lobes. Microscopically senile plaques of various types were found in the cortex. The density of the plaques was very high but Alzheimer's fibrillary degeneration was found occasionally only. The amyloid burden in cortex of the examined brains, estimated as the measure of parenchymal amyloidosis beta, was two to six-fold higher in most areas compared with changes in sporadic AD and Down-syndrome cases. DNA was isolated from blood and tissue of both cases and from blood of their 8 children as well. In both patients mutation in presenilin 1 (PS1) gene of Prol 117 Leu was found and it was discovered that 4 persons of their progeniture were carriers of this mutation. The described mutation causes one of the earliest so far reported onset and death in FAD kindreds. Presenilin isolated from both cases and transfected into cultures of murine neuroblastoma and human kidneys provoked production of beta amyloid with increased A-beta 42/40 ratio."}, {"Title": "Divergences in American psychiatry during the Depression: somatic psychiatry, community mental hygiene, and social reconstruction.", "Abstract": "The differences between somatic psychiatrists and mental hygienists, already apparent earlier, became much more pronounced during the Depression years, partly as a consequence of their different perspectives on this social crisis. Somatic psychiatrists, emboldened by the apparent success of new medical treatment methods, reasserted the central position of the mental hospital within psychiatry, attempted to improve the discipline's position within medicine, and promoted basic research. Mental hygienists, following the ideal of prevention, proposed far-reaching programs of community mental hygiene to alleviate widespread mental distress.

However, as it has been suggested that some of the brain changes in schizophrenia may vary depending on the illness phase, we studied DAT density in eight stable, medicated chronic schizophrenic patients and eight matched controls using positron emission tomography and [18F]CFT, a marker of dopamine nerve terminals. [18F]CFT binding potentials were significantly lower in chronic schizophrenic patients than in controls, both in the caudate and the putamen (-9 to -16%). Together with the finding of unchanged average striatal DAT levels in first-episode patients and relative insensitivity of striatal [18F]CFT binding to endogenous dopamine and neuroleptic drugs, the result is in line with a relative loss of striatal dopaminergic nerve terminals and/or decreased expression of DAT in a subset of chronic schizophrenic patients."}, {"Title": "Cultural psychiatry: international perspectives. Epilogue.", "Abstract": "The psychiatry of the 21st century will have to be different from the psychiatry of the 20th century. The latter began its journey in a socially, compartmentalized world in which sharp categories and boundaries for the definition of mental illness were assumed to be relevant. International psychiatry completed its hegemonic hold over the territory of mental health and illness with a commanding home-stretch run of success borne in the confidence and optimism of its neurobiologic and culture free program and agenda. The world in which psychiatry now exists, however is changing rapidly and will continue to change and so of necessity will the practice of psychiatry need to change. This issue offers a guidelines and a vision of the direction that should be followed. Migration and transnational communication and awareness of cultural differences are changing the character of communities around the world. These changes considered in the context of world wide political economic factors are bringing into close physical and symbolic juxtaposition persons from distinct nations and ethnic groups. Clashes in world views, attitudes, spiritual orientation, and general philosophic and moral outlook are becoming ever-present realities of urban centers around the world. In traditional contexts and among persons who do not physically migrate, the power of communications media manages to psychologically migrate them; that is, to challenge their local, native cultural traditions about mental health with the scientific perspectives about mental health and illness. Advances in the social and cultural sciences have underscored ways in which assumptions of reductionism and universalism need to be chastened with an appreciation of human differences and humane considerations as these relate to mental health problems. The science of psychiatry of the 21st century will have to accomodate to this new creolized world of ethnic pluralism, cultural differences, and clashing perspectives between the traditional and the modern. The boundaries, categories, and the conceits governing the closed neurobiologic international program and agenda will need to be modified and broadened by the addition, sensitivity to and appreciation of cultural differences. This issue has reviewed the efforts of scholars around the world who are all deeply committed to the goals of the old international psychiatry but judge that a new vision and idiom is needed. A responsive international cultural psychiatry is based on a blending and integration of all facets of knowledge of the behavioral sciences, from biology, pharmacology, genetics on through sociology and cultural anthropology. In a new idiom it seeks to provide to all communities of the globe the best that the science of psychiatry has to offer in the areas of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The best psychiatry possible translates as providing expert scientific diagnosis and therapy in light of an appreciation of the role played by cultural factors in shaping human behavior. Contributors have covered the broad terrain of clinical psychiatry in a selective way giving emphasis to demographic, regional, and national needs in areas of mental health planning and therapy. The reviews of empirical issues and the formulation of conceptual areas needing further clarification provide a perspective of what a culturally sensitive and responsive international psychiatry should consist of."}, {"Title": "Culture, spirituality, and mental health. The forgotten aspects of religion and health.", "Abstract": "Modern psychiatry has neglected the spiritual dimension of the human mind and the teleologic concept of illness as meaningful sufferings by clinging to the traditional causality principle and rationalistic orientations without clarifying the concepts of religion, spirituality, culture, and mental health.

It is grounded in Western systems of thought, values, and world views. In assessing the cultural and national presuppositions of contemporary psychiatry, it is desirable to analyze other systems of practice. In this article, some of the characteristics of ancient, non-Western traditions of mental health and approaches to mental illness are discussed. In reviewing salient characteristics of the approach to mental health and illness of India and China, one is provided with a vivid illustration of the interplay between culture and a system of psychiatric practice. The secular and essentially impersonal features of modern biomedical psychiatry contrast with the spiritual, value-laden, but also naturalistic basis of ancient traditions and approaches to mental health and illness."}, {"Title": "Affective disorders in cultural context.", "Abstract": "This article reviews epidemiologic and ethnographic evidence for the cultural shaping of the causes, symptomatology, and course of affective disorders. Cross-cultural research demonstrates much overlap of depression with anxiety, somatoform, and dissociative disorders, raising questions about the universality of the prototypical representation of depression in North American psychiatry. Culture-specific symptoms may lead to under-recognition or misidentification of syndromes of mania and depression in many ethnocultural groups. Cultural idioms of distress may employ symptoms related to affective disorders to express sentiments and perceptions that do not in themselves indicate psychopathology. Socially mediated cognition about the self and specific modes of interpersonal interaction influence the course of depression. This article discusses some implications of these findings for the recognition and treatment of affective disorders among culturally diverse populations in primary care and mental health care settings."}, {"Title": "The Latin American guide for psychiatric diagnosis. A cultural overview.", "Abstract": "The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders is being accepted by most countries and by the World Psychiatric Association as the international standard in the field for statistical reporting and for clinical care and research. Emerging now, however, is the need to harmonize international communication with recognition of cultural diversity and specific local requirements. Latin American psychiatrists hold a long-standing commitment to the formulation of a reliable and valid diagnostic system in international psychiatry. Examples of important Latin American contributions include the pioneering use of explicit operational criteria in diagnostic methodology by Horwitz and Marconi in Chile, and the proposal of a multiaxial diagnostic formulation by Leme-Lopes in Brazil. In recent times, two main Latin American efforts at developing diagnostic adaptations to the international classification in psychiatry have emerged. One is the Cuban Glossary of Psychiatry, already in its third edition, and the second is a more ambitious project to develop the Latin American Guide for Psychiatric Diagnosis (GLADP). Departing from the experience gained by the Cuban psychiatry and keeping ICD-10 as the basis for nosological organization of mental disorders, the GLADP is being developed with the contributions of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals from most countries in Latin America. The GLADP comprises 4 parts: (I) historical and cultural framework of Latin American psychiatry; (II) a comprehensive diagnostic process and formulation, (III) psychiatric nosology (including ICD-10 major classes of disorders and Latin American cultural syndromes); and (IV) appendixes (including, a lexicologic glossary, concepts and proposals for future study, and bibliography). This is an overview of the basic principles and dimensions for psychiatric diagnosis in Latin America, with an emphasis on its cultural framework."}, {"Title": "From diversity to unity. The classification of mental disorders in 21st-century China.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric disease constructs represent social constructs and genuine states of distress that have biopsychosocial sources. As such, they have social uses peculiar to the social groups in which they are created and legitimized. This is as true in the United States as in the rest of the world. The DSM schema, for instance, is so organized that every possible mental condition is listed as a disease to legitimate remuneration to practitioners from private medical insurance and government programs. This particular social use may be irrelevant to other societies where health care is financed differently. The CCMD-3 system represents an attempt at global unification and preservation of features that are salient for local application. Compared with its previous editions, noticeable changes have been made to render it in tune with international usage. This remarkable speed of adaptation speaks to the global flows of information technology and China's openness under rapid economic reform. It also demonstrates that the middle-aged cohort of more pragmatic Chinese psychiatric leaders who headed the CCMD-3 task force are now less vulnerable to the domination of the most senior generation of Chinese psychiatrists. Having been trained in the Russian system of psychiatry and gone through the various periods of national shame that traumatized China, they used to be very cautious about adopting foreign technology in general. This is why much less harmonization with the ICD-10 occurred with the CCMD-2-R, when the responsible task force was, for better or worse, dominated by these senior psychiatrists. Nonetheless, as Stengel and Sartorius remarked, an international classification must not aim to oust or replace regional classifications that serve valuable functions in the local contexts. No single classificatory system, Kirmayer submits, will suffice for all purposes--the correct diagnostic scheme is the one that accomplishes its explicit pragmatic aim by addressing the relevant level of description. The particular additions (e.g., travelling psychosis, culture-related mental disorders), deletions (e.g., depressive neurosis, pathologic gambling, avoidant and borderline personality disorders), retentions (e.g., unipolar mania, neurosis, hysteria, homosexuality), and epistemologic variations (e.g., somatoform disorder, neurasthenia) of diagnostic categories reflect exactly this simultaneous need to globalize and to take account of the changing reality of illness in contemporary China. Stengel advised that \"no psychiatric classification can help being partly etiological and partly symptomatological, because these are the criteria by which psychiatrists distinguish mental disorders from each other.\" To an extent, the CCMD-3 is a critique of certain nosologic assumptions of Western psychiatry, such as the feasibility of a neo-Kraepelinian taxonomy grounded exclusively in symptomatology across all diagnostic categories, and the validity of syndromic architectures based on a firm adherence to the mind-body dichotomy. From this angle of vision, local systems of classification such as the CCMD-3 may offer an opportunity for needed reflections by North American psychiatrists who have simply taken the DSM-IV schema for granted. Sartorius reckoned that a classification is a way of seeing the world at a point in time. A deep study of the CCMD-3 is thus an avenue for achieving an understanding of the contemporary Chinese mind and the social realities in China. The remarkable diversity of China at present, namely, a Communist Party dominated state socialist political structure but the most rapidly growing capitalist economy in the world, guarantees that Chinese people's social and moral experience of illness will continue to change. The study of such culture-specific categories as travelling psychosis, neurasthenia, qigong-induced mental disorder, and dysfunctional homosexuality sheds light on the larger sociomoral processes and destabilizing changes in subjectivity that are occurring in this most populous country in the world."}, {"Title": "Culture and history in psychiatric diagnosis and practice.", "Abstract": "A brief review of the history of Western psychiatry underscores how happenings in Anglo European societies during the early modern and modern era impacted on regional populations in the midst of profound demographic, social and political economic change. Such factors along with cultural conventions created an amalgam of behavior problems: social responses to these under the aegis administrative bodies gave rise to the discipline and profession of psychiatry. Central tenets that we take for granted as facts about psychiatric disorders (e.g., their manifestations, natural history, diagnosis) were shaped by historical and cultural influences. Psychiatry may outline a science of the psyche and its disturbances but it also reflects a cultural interpretation about personal experience, responsibility, social behavior, and the requirements for social order. The cultural character of the psychiatric enterprise itself, just as much as the characteristics of its disorders, constitute the subject matter of cultural psychiatry. Events during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in Anglo European societies gave rise to psychiatry. First, there took place the differentiation of psychiatric disorders from the pool of human social and behavior problems. Second, and in relation to this, a segment of the medical profession was accorded (or appropriated) a social mandate and acquired an obligation to treat victims of mental disorders. The historical sociology of psychiatry constitutes one aspect of cultural psychiatry. The second covers developments during the latter part of the twentieth century. At this juncture, psychiatry became the target of labeling theorists in sociology, cultural relativists in anthropology, antipsychiatrists from within the discipline itself, and revisionist and critical historians of psychiatry. An outgrowth of this is the perspective that underscores the important role played by values, ideas, and world-views in how individuals experience and carry out their lives, phenomena that are critical to the expression, interpretation, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. That the science and practice of modern psychiatry incorporate an ethnocentric, Anglo European bias or slant on psychopathology is an integral assumption of cultural psychiatry. By describing how other non-Western systems of psychiatry have operated, for example, their theories and practices, one gains a further appreciation of the important role of culture in shaping Western psychiatry. This is taken up in an article by F\u00e0brega elsewhere in this issue where concepts and practices of traditional Chinese and Indian medicine that pertain to mental health and illness are reviewed."}, {"Title": "[Cortisol in night-urine: Introduction of a research method in psychoneuroendocrinology].", "Abstract": "Cortisol is one of the major parameters investigated in psychoneuroendocrinological research, but the methods employed for sample collecting are often unsatisfactory. A suitable method of sample collection should allow for the integrative assessment of long-term changes of the HPA-system, should be non-invasive, and should not exceed the subject's compliance. The assessment of cortisol in night-urine fulfils these demands; although this method has been occasionally employed, it has not yet been described systematically. For the first time a detailed description is given here that allows for a standardized replication. In ten previous studies and three investigations of our own this method has been successfully applied to detect changes in the cortisol excretion of patients with endocrinological and psychiatric disorders as well as in subjects under conditions of psychosocial stress. The determination of cortisol in night-urine represents an ideal method for the assessment of changes in the basal HPA-activity in numerous areas of psychoneuroendocrinological research, e.g. field and screening studies in natural environment, clinical studies in psychiatry and especially follow-up studies in psychotherapy research."}, {"Title": "The impact of pre- and perinatal factors on attention-deficit and disruptive behavior disorders.", "Abstract": "Diagnosis of attention-deficit and disruptive behavior disorders defines a group of disorders which have common properties.

In order to differentiate these disorders, which share similar properties, it is important to verify the existing differences. In this respect, differences between and distribution of perinatal factors in these three disorders were investigated. The study was conducted in the Child Psychiatry and Pediatric Neurology Departments over a 20-month period. Two hundred and seventy children out of 1,556 attendant with various complaints were diagnosed to have one of the following disorders: 121 had attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, 50 had oppositional defiant disorder and 99 had conduct disorder. The prenatal and perinatal data of the patients were evaluated retrospectively by a neonatologist. With regard to the investigated parameters, none showed any significant difference between the three groups when compared. The three disorders, which share many similarities in terms of the symptoms, also show similarities in terms of perinatal factors.

To demonstrate that assumptions of validity for outcomes measures can affect the interpretation of data from prevalence surveys.\nWe recruited Punjabi and English subjects to a phase prevalence survey that included the Amritsar Depression Inventory and the General Health Questionnaire as screening instruments. The Clinical Interview Schedule was the outcome measure. This paper reports on a secondary analysis of the data. We used ethnic group, place of birth, religion, first language and language spoken at interview as possible cultural group variables and compared the prevalence estimates. We then considered the limitations of conventional methods to assess prevalence, by looking at mean scores on each of the three instruments in both cultural groups.\nCultural group variables did not influence the prevalence estimates for Common Mental Disorder. Although conventional scoring methods showed no difference in prevalence across cultures, the mean scores on each instrument, when compared across cultural groups, differed for the Amritsar Depression Inventory. This instrument showed a higher mean score for the Punjabis suggesting a higher prevalence. The findings are discussed in the context of value laden 'assumptions' about validity.\nThe findings of prevalence surveys depend on assumptions of validity.

Different kinds of diagnoses serve different purposes in child psychiatry: classification, understanding the child, and guiding intervention. All discourse about diagnosis is shaped by culture, especially aspects of culture that may be difficult to acknowledge. Integration of the role of culture into clinical practice is facilitated by balancing the use of categorical diagnoses with consensus-based assessment, including acknowledgment of the relative positions of clinician and child."}, {"Title": "Community factors supporting child mental Health.", "Abstract": "A principal purpose of this article has been to examine the gap between research and practice in relation to community factors in child mental health. Two caveats were introduced in preparation for this assessment. First, it was pointed out that the definition of communities has been expanded by considering the organizing properties of social aggregates that are not simply a function of the race, ethnicity, or social class of individuals who compose them. Having these definitions grounded in theory substantially advances the needs of research and the design and goals of community-level interventions. The second caveat relates to the boundaries of the disciplines that cater to the needs of children. During the same era when child psychiatry is largely occupied with placing psychotropic medications at the center of clinical approaches, there is an important effort in child psychology and sociology to cut across their disciplinary confines to form more comprehensive designs that are sensitive to experiences and circumstances that emerge from specific aspects of community context. Research from the PHDCN was used as an example of this new interdisciplinary approach. Several community-based research projects were selected for review based on their clear implications to improve context-sensitive assessment of child mental health and design effective community-based interventions to improve child mental health. The Healthy Start and CATCH programs indicate that involving child professionals at the grassroots of community life requires skill and patience but that the effort is satisfying and potentially effective. Other examples, exemplified by North Carolina's Smart Start initiative and the program of developmental assets from the Search Institute, demonstrate coherent approaches that provide a foundation for long-term capacity building in assessment, local decision making, and the design and evaluation of interventions. Three conclusions are warranted from this discussion. The first conclusion suggests that research in child development generally, and child mental health specifically, does not incorporate the social ecology of the child is seriously flawed. There is a broad recognition within most sectors of society that the quality of civic engagement is of critical importance to community efforts to improve the health and well-being of children. This is true for all communities and families, regardless of their levels of material wealth and educational achievement. It is also well understood that poverty undermines the well-being and life chances of children. For this reason, the third conclusion requires that intensive, sustained efforts be made to eradicate poverty and reverse the current economic trend toward growing economic disparity. The implications of this knowledge for the practice of child psychiatry are not new ones. In many ways, they advocate for a re-examination of the historical roots of the field as it defined approaches to juvenile justice, school counseling, and early intellectual enrichment for economically disadvantaged preschool children. All these efforts were sensitive to children's social environment, and child psychiatrists viewed their success in taking on the challenges of changing schools, courts, and community and family environments. These challenges hardly have been overcome. The requirements of understanding and evaluating community supports for children are a fundamental component in the training and practice of child psychiatry. To quote the U.S. Surgeon General in a preamble to the recent Report on Child Mental Health: One way to ensure that our health system meets children's mental health needs is to move toward a community based health system that balances health promotion, disease prevention, early detection and universal access."}, {"Title": "A developmental and psychobiologic framework for understanding the role of culture in child and adolescent psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In summary, despite these widely accepted interdisciplinary perspectives on the role of culture, the DSM framework lacks a culturally meaningful usage. For Kleinman, the changes on culture in the DSM-IV were \"too little, too late.\" The cultural formulation and a glossary of culture-bound syndromes were included in its appendix. The acceptance by the DSM-IV task force of the notion of cultural variations in clinical presentation of disorders may be reflective of changes to come in the future. The current DSM-IV has more of a descriptive psycho-pathologic approach rather than an integrated cross-cultural, psychobiologic, developmental approach, however. The developmental perspective in psychiatry is emerging as a \"bridge\" for consilience through evidence-based scientific understanding and conciliation through clinical practice. This perspective is unique because it is intrinsic to different aspects of psychiatry. It readily accommodates the descriptive-empirical model by means of concepts borrowed from developmental psychopathology and psychobiology. These concepts include normalcy, life cycle, risk and resilience, and protective mechanisms within a dynamic construction of development that involves an interchange among biology-person-society-culture. The developmental perspective also can make important contributions to a process-oriented approach to measurement beyond a textually defined DSM structure. The developmentally operationalized dimensional constructs offer to expand psychiatry's domains beyond diagnosable conditions and illness boundaries. The developmental perspective argues for early preventive and therapeutic interventions for a broad array of applications based on demonstrated evidence of efficacy. Finally, the developmental perspective with its social and cultural contexts is an intrinsic complement to Kandel's framework for an expanded training of psychiatrists in the neurosciences and the associated innovative technologies for understanding the mechanism of structural and functional changes in the brain in various contexts and categories."}, {"Title": "A self-assessment program for multidisciplinary mental health teams.", "Abstract": "The authors describe a self-assessment training program for multidisciplinary mental health teams that was developed in a public multihospital system, the process of implementing the training at a state psychiatric hospital, and a measurement instrument, the Scale for Leadership Assessment and Team Evaluation (SLATE), which they have used for self-assessment of multidisciplinary teams and which is currently being studied. They assessed whether changes in team self-assessments could be seen after the training program.\nA total of 102 mental health professionals from 12 inpatient units representing the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, nursing, social work, and occupational and activity therapy completed the SLATE before and after participation in a training program that consisted primarily of team self-assessment in the context of treatment planning sessions. The training program included structured feedback, didactics, consultation, and videotaping of sessions. Aggregate data were used to compare mean item scores for the SLATE overall and for its four subscales (team, psychiatrist, participation, and treatment plan) at baseline and after the training.\nScores increased significantly for the overall SLATE and for all four subscales, indicating improved team functioning in the areas addressed. The increase in mean score was greatest for the subscale that assessed the leadership of the psychiatrist.\nTreatment planning sessions can be used successfully by multidisciplinary mental health teams to examine team functioning in various areas in a self-assessment model.

Psychiatric help is sought in only a small proportion of cases, although it is probable that the psychological etiology of the disorder is more frequent than generally recognized. This article deals with the causes and psychological circumstances of the disorder. Five cases are presented. In the first three cases, primary vaginismus caused unconsummated marriage in young women of religious or traditional background. In these cases a \"secret\" was revealed relating to a previous sexually related experience. This provides the basis for therapy. The other cases describe secondary vaginismus which appeared in older women who developed the symptom after a number of years of marriage. This article discusses the different psychotherapeutic approaches for the two types of cases. In the former cases, therapy may be brief and the prognosis is favorable. In the second case type, there is often more significant personality or marital pathology requiring prolonged and extensive psychotherapy. The authors stress the need for physicians to be mindful of cases of vaginismus requiring psychiatric intervention rather than gynecological treatment."}, {"Title": "Self-help strategies among patients with substance use disorders.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine (1) the type and extent of self-help efforts among patients presenting for treatment of substance use disorders, and (2) the association of self-help with demographic and clinical characteristics. A retrospective report of life self-help methods, current demographic characteristics, and current and lifetime clinical characteristics was used. Six hundred and forty-two patients in treatment for substance use disorder were interviewed at one of two university medical centers with Alcohol-Drug Programs located within departments of psychiatry. A research associate (RA) interviewed patients regarding seven types of self-help involving specific, mutually exclusive behaviors and rated the patient's lifetime self-help methods. The patient, RA, and addiction psychiatrists provided demographic, familial, and clinical information. Most patients (78%) had tried one or more types of self-help, with a mean of 2.7 methods per patient. They more frequently chose methods related to the substance (decreasing amounts or frequency, or changing substance type) or joining a self-help group than methods that involved changing friends, residence, or occupation/job/school. Certain patterns of self-help tended to occur together (e.g., changing substance frequency and dose), whereas others appeared more independent (e.g., joining a self-help group). Some self-help approaches occurred mostly in association with other methods rather than alone (e.g., changing occupation/job/school). More self-help was associated with higher socioeconomic class, more relatives with substance use disorder, greater severity of substance use disorder, and more treatment for substance use disorder. Self-help tends to occur more often after exposure to addicted relatives or addiction treatment. Clinicians and public adult education should promulgate self-help methods in the general population."}, {"Title": "Mental illness: psychiatry's phlogiston.", "Abstract": "In physics, we use the same laws to explain why airplanes fly, and why they crash. In psychiatry, we use one set of laws to explain sane behaviour, which we attribute to reasons (choices), and another set of laws to explain insane behaviour, which we attribute to causes (diseases). God, man's idea of moral perfection, judges human deeds without distinguishing between sane persons responsible for their behaviour and insane persons deserving to be excused for their evil deeds. It is hubris to pretend that the insanity defence is compassionate, just, or scientific. Mental illness is to psychiatry as phlogiston was to chemistry. Establishing chemistry as a science of the nature of matter required the recognition of the non-existence of phlogiston. Establishing psychiatry as a science of the nature of human behaviour requires the recognition of the non-existence of mental illness."}, {"Title": "Improving the psychiatric knowledge, skills, and attitudes of primary care physicians, 1950-2000: a review.", "Abstract": "The authors reviewed the literature on mental health education for primary care physicians and made recommendations for the design of educational programs and research.\nThey searched the MEDLINE and PsycLIT databases from 1950 to 2000 by using a variety of key words and subjects.\nMore than 400 articles were identified, ranging from empirical studies to philosophical articles. Many identified a perceptual gap between primary care and psychiatry as the basis for problems of contextual relevance in psychiatric education for primary care practitioners. There were few empirical studies; most reported only results of satisfaction surveys or simple tests of knowledge. Long-term outcomes were less positive; there were important negative findings.\nAn extensive literature published over five decades identified a strong need for ongoing mental health training for primary care physicians.

Coryell et al. [Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 39 (1982) 701-703; Am. J.

In the present study, we were, therefore, interested in elucidating the role of estrogen in modulating the behavioural and cardiovascular responses induced by the panicogenic agent pentagastrin, a cholecystokinin-B (CCK(B)) receptor agonist.\nA double-blind cross-over placebo-controlled design with randomization of the order of a 3-day pretreatment of ethinyl estradiol (EE) (50 microg/day) or placebo was used to assess the effect of a 30-microg i.v. bolus injection of pentagastrin on panic symptom intensity and on increases in heart rate (DeltaHR), systolic (DeltaSBP) and diastolic (DeltaDBP) blood pressure following each pretreatment. Subjects were 9 male healthy controls and 11 male PD patients.\nEE pretreatment did not significantly reduce the pentagastrin-induced panic symptom scale (PSS) scores and had no effect on DeltaDBP or DeltaSBP. EE did, however, attenuate the pentagastrin-induced increase in HR in both PD patients and healthy controls.\nOnly male subjects were included in the present study; however, we are currently investigating the influence of female gonadal hormones on the panic response to pentagastrin in female PD patients and healthy controls.\nOur results suggest that estrogens may display cardioprotective effects in the context of panic attacks."}, {"Title": "Use of olanzapine in dysphoric mania.", "Abstract": "The simultaneous presentation of both manic and depressive symptoms has long been recognized.

Sequential assessments were conducted throughout the study.\nForty-four patients (51.2%) fulfilled McElroy's criteria for dysphoric mania. Fourteen of these dysphoric patients were treated with olanzapine in combination with mood-stabilizers. All patients improved in manic symptoms but patients treated with olanzapine improved significantly more than those treated with other antipsychotics in depressive symptoms.\nThe lack of randomization is a methodological limitation of this study, so these findings should be considered as preliminary.\nDysphoric symptoms are common in this population of manic patients. Olanzapine in combination with mood-stabilizers may be effective in these patients. Additional controlled studies are needed to replicate these results."}, {"Title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation as a therapeutic tool in psychiatry: what do we know about the neurobiological mechanisms?", "Abstract": "Potential therapeutic properties of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have been suggested in several psychiatric disorders such as depression, mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia. By inducing electric currents in brain tissue via a time-varying strong magnetic field, rTMS has the potential to either directly or trans-synaptically modulate neuronal circuits thought to be dysfunctional in these psychiatric disorders. However, in order to optimize rTMS for therapeutic use, it is necessary to understand the neurobiological mechanisms involved, particularly the nature of the changes induced and the brain regions affected. Compared to the growing number of clinical studies on its putative therapeutic properties, the studies on the basic mechanisms of rTMS are surprisingly scarce. rTMS currently still awaits clinical routine administration although,there is compelling evidence that it causes changes in neuronal circuits as reflected by behavioural changes and decreases in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system. Both alterations suggest regional changes in neurotransmitter/neuromodulator release, transsynaptic efficiency, signaling pathways and in gene transcription. Together, these changes are, in part, reminiscent of those accompanying antidepressant drugs."}, {"Title": "[Autism and associated pathologies. Clinical study of 295 cases involving development disorders].", "Abstract": "Known since the first descriptions in 1943, diseases related to autism and associated disorders have incited a growing body of work. Both theoretical interrogations (what is the pathogenic role of autism?) and practical measures (management, screening) are implied. Nevertheless the frequency of autism-related disease has varied from 10 to 37% depending on the series reported. We studied the frequency of these factors in a population of children with major development disorders cared for at the Tours university hospital over a 39-month period.\nWe reviewed retrospectively the medial features of 295 children examined in our psychiatry and neurophysiology unit for children at the Tours center for major development disorders (based on the DSM IV diagnostic criteria) between September 1995 and December 1998. We divided these factors into 4 categories: hereditary diseases, serious medical conditions, minimal physical disorders and ante- or perinatal antecedents.\nAmong these 295 children, 26.5% had a proven or probable hereditary disease, 19% had a serious medical condition and 21.7% had minimal physical disorders. Among the children with a serious medical condition, 34.4% also had ante- or perinatal antecedents. Among the 33% without any medical factor, 77% also had ante- or perinatal antecedents.\nOur data point out the quantitative importance of medical factors associated with major development disorders. They imply a close multidisciplinary collaboration between child psychiatrists, pediatricians and geneticists in order to identify these disorders and develop an integrated management scheme. On a more theoretical level, it appears possible to identify subgroups of children among such a population based on associated diseases and neuropsychological patterns.

The variables were frequency and reason for referral, the diagnostic profile according to ICD-10, the number of therapeutic sessions, and registration of pregnancy/birth complications (PBC).\nAnxiety and crisis reactions owing to previous PBC, family problems, and concerns about the fetus were the predominant reasons for referral. A total of 87% met the ICD-10 criteria for adjustment disorder (F 43.2), whereas psychotic disorders were infrequent. In 52%, 1-4 sessions were sufficient to stabilise the condition. The frequency of PBC in the 106 women was significantly higher when compared to the background sample (n = about 15,000).

Since being introduced in Italy in 1938, its mode of action has still not been clarified. Treatment modalities have changed in many ways. ECT, in which a generalized epileptic seizure is provoked by electrical stimulation of the brain, is performed under short intravenous anesthesia and muscle relaxation. Considering careful previous clinical examination and anesthesiological and internal counterindications, ECT is a very safe form of treatment. Single cases of persisting memory impairment were described after the formerly common bilateral sinus wave stimulation. However, recent developments such as brief pulse stimulation, unilateral electrode placement, and individual stimulus titration (on the basis of EEG monitoring) make memory impairment as a consequence of ECT a rare event which mostly remits completely in 4-8 weeks. Today, ECT is performed mainly in patients suffering from severe, therapy-resistant affective or schizophrenic disorders. Pernicious catatonia and the neuroleptic malignant syndrome are emergency indications. Adequate ECT treatment requires a series of 6-12 individual sessions (every second or third day). In therapy-resistant depression, for which the greatest number of data are available, the response rate lies between 50 and 60%. This has been confirmed by a descriptive analysis of all ECT treatments at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Vienna, between 1994 and 2000.

That report focused on telemedicine programs and clinical settings that had been used with or were likely to be applied to Medicare beneficiaries. While we prepared that report, it became apparent that there are also telemedicine studies among non-Medicare beneficiaries--e.g., children and pregnant women--that could inform policymakers and provide more comprehensive evidence of the state of the science regarding telemedicine applications. In addition, the first evidence report only partially included a class of telemedicine applications (called self-monitoring/testing telemedicine) in which the beneficiary used a home computer or modern-driven telephone system to either report information or access information and support from Internet resources and indirectly interact with a clinician. Self-monitoring/testing applications in the first report required direct interaction with a clinician. The goal of this report is to systematically review the evidence in the clinical areas of pediatric and obstetric telemedicine as well as home-based telemedicine where there is indirect involvement of the health care professional. (In this report, we will refer to the latter as clinician-indirect home telemedicine.) Specifically, the report summarizes scientific evidence on the diagnostic accuracy, access, clinical outcomes, satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness of services provided by telemedicine technologies for these patient groups. It also identifies gaps in the evidence and makes recommendations for evaluating telemedicine services for these populations in the future. The evidence is clustered according to three categories of telemedicine service defined in our original report: store-and-forward, self-monitoring/testing, and clinician-interactive services. The three clinical practice areas reviewed in this report are defined as follows. The term pediatric applies to any telemedicine study in which the sample consisted wholly or partially of persons aged 18 or younger, including studies with neonatal samples. The term obstetric applies to any telemedicine study in which the sample consisted entirely of women seeking pregnancy-related care. The term clinician-indirect home telemedicine applies to home-based telemedicine (called self-monitoring/testing in our original report) where a telemedicine application used in the home has only indirect involvement by the health care professional. Interactive home telemedicine was applied in this report to all patient populations.\nThe key questions that served as a guide for reviewing the literature in the evaluation of pediatric, obstetric, and clinician-indirect home telemedicine applications were derived by consensus among the evidence-review team based on the analytic framework established for the original evidence report. For the current report, the questions were applied to studies in all three practice areas as a whole group within each of the three categories of telemedicine services: store-and-forward; self-monitoring/testing; and clinician-interactive. The specific key questions were: 1. Does telemedicine result in comparable diagnosis and appropriateness of recommendations for management? 2. Does the availability of telemedicine provide comparable access to care? 3. Does telemedicine result in comparable health outcomes? 4. Does telemedicine result in comparable patient or clinician satisfaction with care? 5. Does telemedicine result in comparable costs of care and/or cost-effectiveness?\nWe searched for peer-reviewed literature using several bibliographic databases. In addition, we conducted hand searches of leading telemedicine journals and identified key papers from the reference lists of journal articles. For our original evidence report on telemedicine for the Medicare population, we designed a search to find any publications about telemedicine and used it to search the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and HealthSTAR databases for all years the databases were available. Through this process, we captured studies of pediatric, obstetric, and clinician-indirect home telemedicine; however, they were excluded from the original report since they were outside its scope. For this supplemental report, we reviewed our original search results and identified studies relevant to this report. We identified additional studies from the reference lists of included papers and from hand searching two peer-reviewed telemedicine publications, the Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare and Telemedicine Journal. We critically appraised the included studies for each study area and key question and discussed the strengths and limitations of the most important studies at weekly meetings of the research team. We also developed recommendations for research to address telemedicine knowledge gaps. To match these gaps with the capabilities of specific research methods, we classified the telemedicine services according to the type of evidence that would be needed to determine whether the specific goals of covering such services had been met. We emphasized the relationship between the type and level of evidence found in the systematic review of effectiveness and the types of studies that might be funded to address the gaps in knowledge in this growing field of research.\nWe identified a total of 28 eligible studies. In the new clinical areas, we found few studies in store-and-forward telemedicine. There is some evidence of comparable diagnosis and management decisions made using store-and-forward telemedicine from the areas of pediatric dental screening, pediatric ophthalmology, and neonatalogy. In self-monitoring/testing telemedicine for the areas of pediatrics, obstetrics, and clinician-indirect home telemedicine, there is evidence that access to care can be improved when patients and families have the opportunity to receive telehealth care at home rather than in-person care in a clinic or hospital. Access is particularly enhanced when the telehealth system enables timely communication between patients or families and care providers that allows self-management and necessary adjustments that may prevent hospitalization. There is some evidence that this form of telemedicine improves health outcomes, but the study sample sizes are usually small, and even when they are not, the treatment effects are small. There is also some evidence for the efficacy of clinician-interactive telemedicine, but the studies do not clearly define which technologies provide benefit or cost-efficiency. Some promising areas for diagnosis include emergency medicine, psychiatry, and cardiology. Most of the studies measuring access to care provide evidence that it is improved. Although none of these studies were randomized controlled trials, they provide some evidence of access improvement over prior conditions. Clinician-interactive telemedicine was the only area for which any cost studies were found. The three cost studies did not adequately demonstrate that telemedicine reduces costs of care (except comparing only selected costs). No study addressed cost-effectiveness.\nThis supplemental report covering the areas of pediatrics, obstetrics, and indirect-clinician home telemedicine echoes the findings of our initial report for the Medicare domain, which is that while the use of telemedicine is small but growing, the evidence for its efficacy is incomplete. Many of the studies are small and/or methodologically limited, so it cannot be determined whether telemedicine is efficacious. Future studies should focus on the use of telemedicine in conditions where burden of illness and/or barriers to access for care are significant. Use of recent innovations in the design of randomized controlled trials for emerging technologies would lead to higher quality studies. Journals publishing telemedicine evaluation studies must set high standards for methodologic quality so that evidence reports need not rely on studies with marginal methodologies."}, {"Title": "The placebo response in social phobia.", "Abstract": "The placebo response forms a growing problem in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in psychiatry. Research into the placebo response is on the increase, but remains very limited in relation to social phobia. Together with the dropout rate, the placebo effect is an important factor limiting the discriminative properties of any study. In this study, we reviewed 15 placebo-controlled studies in social phobia, focussing on patients and study characteristics. In social phobia, the placebo effect has turned out to be moderately large and has shown no increase over the past decade. Placebo response was highest in large, multicentred trials and was independent of study duration. No validation for a placebo run-in was found. Taking into account both response to placebo and active drug, as well as dropout rate, the most discriminative results are probably to be expected in a sample of patients who are moderately to severely impaired. More research in the field of the placebo response is needed."}, {"Title": "Prodromes of first-episode psychosis: how can we challenge nonspecificity?", "Abstract": "Prevention of functional psychosis is a major concern of modern psychiatry. The aim is to avoid biological and psychosocial deterioration at the earliest possible stage of the illness. The term \"prodrome\" has become crucial for identification of the very early stage. Recent years have yielded intensive research effort in defining prodromal signs and symptoms; however, the conclusion of most researchers is that they are nonspecific. We present the descriptive and phenomenological findings of the prodrome concept. Although prodromes are nonspecific, their discrepancy with persisting social impairment over time is a frequently encountered and highly alarming feature in young at-risk individuals. The inclusion of phenomenological findings may suggest the presence of psychosis-like inner experiences already as early as the prodromal phase, and thus bears in itself the question of the starting point for psychopharmacological and psychosocial treatment. Finally, a decision pathway for clinicians is proposed in their difficult task of identifying young individuals at risk."}, {"Title": "A framework for considering the ethical aspects of psychiatric research protocols.", "Abstract": "The ethics of psychiatric research has emerged as a topic of national importance. Attention to this topic has been stimulated by a number of factors, including heightened awareness of the distinct moral problems arising in the care of mental illness, the rapid development of new psychopharmaceutical agents, the emergence of evidence-based approaches in psychiatry, the expansion of clinical trials within the private mental health sector, and recent recommendations offered by the President's National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC). Consequently, clinical practitioners and investigators alike will increasingly be called upon to evaluate the ethical acceptability of psychiatric research protocols encountered in their professional work. In light of this, we present a framework for considering ethical aspects of psychiatric research protocols. This framework gives emphasis to nine elements: (1) scientific issues; (2) research team issues; (3) risk and benefit in protocol design; (4) confidentiality; (5) selection, exclusion, and recruitment considerations; (6) informed consent and decisional capacity; (7) incentives; (8) institutional and peer/professional review issues; and (9) data presentation issues.

Questions about sexual physical stress and the use of Viagra or MUSE are dominant in the first step. But usually sexual disorders of men and women are a challenge for the cardiologist: is there not another problem behind? Is sexual disorder only a \"common symptom\"? Is there a need for psychotherapy? There are patients with a \"well functioning\" of all sexual functions but however feeling unhappy and not satisfied because lacking in sexual fulfilling [32]. The most common questions in my opinion deal with male patients after CABG or valve replacement surgery or after myocardial infarction (MI) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Those patients often are concerned about future sexual activity or about a diminished libido. Some fear of failing during intercourse.\nThe risk of having severe complications during sexual activity is far less than many of the patients and their partners or we the cardiologists would have expected. In only about 0.9% of patients with MI sexual activity was a likely contributor to the onset of MI [27]. Regular exercise reduces the risk of MI by sexual activity. Even in high risk CAD-patients the risk for MI or death are low with 20 chances per million per hour with known CAD [14].\nOne of the largest and longest during newer studies is the Massachusetts Male Aging Study (MMAS) asking men with an age of 40-69 years. There was a prevalence of ED (3 levels: mild, moderate, complete) of 39% in the 40 years old and of maximal 67% in men with 69 years of age [16]. Common risks for ED are lower education, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, cigarette smoking, obesity [22]. As early as possible we should reinforce patients (or even \"non-yet-patients\") to adopt healthy lifestyles with more physical activity to modify risk for sexual malfunction and for heart disease as well [15].\nThe prevalence seems to be the same as in men. The most common complaints depending upon their age include decreased libido, vaginal dryness, pain with intercourse, decreased genital sensation and difficulty or inability to achieve orgasm [5]. One of the most important problems for older women are the availability of a sexually active partner and the presence of concurrent illnesses. We should ask for sexual history in older women because the need of love and sexual intimacy does not diminish with age [25]. The risks for FSD are age related as well as para-aging: level of education, history of sexual abuse or sexually transmitted disease, the \"integrity\" of physical health as well as the overall state general happiness [19]. DEPRESSION AS A RISC FACTOR FOR CAD AND IMPAIRMENT OF SEXUALITY: As cardiologists know sexual dysfunction may be a risk indicator for arteriosclerosis and for heart disease or even a consequence of heart disease. Depression is meanwhile recognized as a independent risk factor for MI. But the connexion of depression and sexual dysfunction is a common problem for psychiatrists', gynaecologists', urologists' and cardiologists' consulting-hours [2, 3, 18, 20, 21, 23].\nThere is very little data available on this topic. Data are dealing with the need of information for patients and partners on the physical stress during sexual activity [33].\nThe examples for clinical status are given in a simple scheme of the Princeton Consensus Panel. Patients with low risk (the large majority of patients) can be safely encouraged to initiate or resume sexual activity or to receive treatment for sexual dysfunction. In group 2 patients with an intermediate risk should undergo cardiologic evaluation before restratification into low- or high-risk category. In the high-risk patients there is a precondition before resuming sexual activity: stabilisation by specific treatment [13].\nThink on the sexual dysfunction when treating female and male cardiologic patients. Work together with other disciplines (gynaecology, psychiatry, sexual medicine, urology) when evaluating a treatment plan. As early as possible try to reinforce lifestyle change for risk factor modification. The absolute risk for death or MI during sexual activity is very low even in patients with known CAD."}, {"Title": "Is DSM widely accepted by Japanese clinicians?", "Abstract": "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition (DSM-III), a new standardized diagnostic system with multiaxial diagnosis, operational criteria and renewed definitions of mental disorders, was introduced in 1980 and prompted movements to reform conventions in Japanese psychiatry. This review overviews the initial response of Japanese clinicians to accept DSM-III, and its effects on the development of systematic research of psychiatric diagnosis. These new research activities include those on reliability of psychiatric diagnosis, application of various evaluation tools, discussion on the concept of mental disorders, relation of personality disorders with depressive disorders, and Taijin-kyofusho, or culturally distinctive phobia in Japan. A reference database search to survey the latest trend on psychiatric research indicated that the number of papers published by Japanese workers increased sharply after 1987, and DSM apparently greatly influenced their internationalization. Twenty years after the publication of DSM-III, a questionnaire on the use of DSM-IV was set out in 2000 to survey how widely DSM is utilized in clinical practice in Japan. Two hundred and twelve psychiatrists answered the questionnaire, and the results show that DSM has been accepted positively by the younger generation, while the older generation (over 40s) has still less interest in DSM, and DSM is used mainly for research purposes rather than in daily practice."}, {"Title": "Feminist conceptualizations of women's madness: a review of the literature.", "Abstract": "Gender is one aspect of an individual's identity that has been widely debated and discussed in relation to many different aspects of social life.

The data about suicide attempt in patients were assembled from the Psychiatry Department of Bjelovar General Hospital in 1988-1990 period. The data about committed suicides in 1988-1998 period were assembled from Bjelovar-Bilogora police administration. That enabled the analyses of suicides realisation in a suicide attempters group. Sex rate differences were explained by differences in sex roles. Proportional relation between suicide and age and reverse proportional relation between suicide attempts and age was due to biological and psychosocial characteristics of the young and the old. Relation between self-destructive behaviour and appeal in suicidal behaviour was emphasized. Male suicide attempters were more often under the influence of alcohol which reflected alcoholism in general population. In suicide attempts men chose severe means more often than women. More frequent diagnosis of personal disorder in male suicide attempt group was explained by three factors: 1. Higher frequency of antisocial personal disorder in male population; 2. Psychiatrist tendency to avoid stigmatization of patients with personal disorder diagnosis, which has negative connotation of old concept of psychopathy; and 3. Psychiatrist tendency to use this diagnosis only for more serious forms of disruptive behaviour, such as antisocial personal disorder. Three characteristics were pointed out: 1. Low social sensitivity for suicidal behaviour; 2. Failure to instruct individuals to seek psychiatrist help; and 3. Individual hesitation to seek that help. This emphasized the need for the development of non-hospital psychiatry service, as well as the organization of continual psychiatric monitoring of regional epidemiological suicide data."}, {"Title": "[Sertraline in child and adolescent psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to research the efficiency of sertraline (zoloft) in depressions, anxious states and obsessive-compulsive disorders.

Data pertained to demographic characteristics, source of referral, reason for referral, psychiatric diagnosis according to DSM-III-R, and intervention. Our study demonstrated significant changes in diagnostic characteristics and in patterns of referral and intervention over the years. Changes in source of referral and psychiatric diagnoses were associated with the increasing involvement of clinical psychologists and specialists in psychosomatic medicine. Also, surgeons and physicians were increasingly aware of psychiatric morbidity in medical-surgical populations.

Because schizophrenic patients present very different types of psychopathological cross-sectional syndromes, the choice of a distinct neuroleptic or antidepressant compound and their dosage has to be guided along the psychopathological target syndrome. The clinical-therapeutical effects of neuroleptics and antidepressants are above all symptom- (Freyhan) or syndrome-directed. The differentiation of positive and negative symptoms, acute and chronic or residual schizophrenia, or of the prodromal symptoms according to contemporary approaches seems to be not sufficient for the early detection of psychopathological predictors of an impending psychosis and the special indication and choice of a distinct drug and dosing strategy. This is valid for maintenance treatment of patients in remission, for early intervention in the prodromal stages before the first and later psychotic episodes and in preventing relapses. Relapse rates can be reduced by a low dose maintenance therapy with basic symptom oriented early adaptation of the dosage in the prodromes before psychotic remanifestations. Some presuppositions of an effective psychopharmacological and psychological therapy in view of clinical psychopathology (K. Schneider) and the \"phenomenological attitude\" (K. Jaspers) are outlined. A necessary condition for the secondary as well as for the primary prevention of psychotic episodes is the detailed knowledge of the interindividual different dynamic and cognitive basic symptoms, defined in the Bonn Scale BSABS, that are experiential in kind and not identical with the negative and behavioral \"Prodromal and Residual Symptoms\" of DSM and ICD-10. The early detection and preventive intervention of schizophrenic psychoses is most likely possible by means of a subtle, descriptive-analytical phenomenology and psychopathology. Also \"chronic\" patients beyond acute psychoses, e. g. those with persisting pure residues, characterized not by true negative, but by basic symptoms, often respond to distinct atypical neuroleptics and/or antidepressants. The knowledge of the prodromal symptoms and the coping strategies, frequently developed by the patients themselves, is an essential component of a basic symptom oriented psychoeducational concept."}, {"Title": "[Attempts to overcome the stigma of schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "The results of research into attitudes show clearly that the knowledge, the attitudes and views of our society towards psychiatric topics strongly influence practical psychiatric services. Those affected report that they are confronted with a high degree of prejudice and exclusion which considerably inhibits their recovery, their integration and their quality of life even today. Especially people with schizophrenic illnesses are affected by stigmatisation and exclusion. These are not just caused by a lack of information. Prejudices and misconceptions are deeply rooted in our cultural tradition. The negative consequences for the treatment and way of life of those affected are such that Asmus Finzen spoke of a \"second illness\" which may be caused by stigmatisation.Set against the background of the vulnerability-stress-paradigm, the social consequences can result in stressors. Disadvantages in terms of societal participation, negative assessments and humiliating discrimination can undermine self-esteem, ability to cope and compliance and thereby hinder the recovery process and strengthen remaining marks of the illness. Since there is extensive informed understanding about these problems, the discussion focuses increasinlgy on questions about what psychiatry and those working in psychiatry can contribute to reverse this negative attitude.

Research on diagnostic practices in routine clinical settings--in which unstructured interviewing is the norm--suggests that comorbid conditions are often not detected [Zimmerman, M., Mattia, J. 1999. Psychiatric diagnosis in clinical practice: Is comorbidity being missed? Compr. Psychiatry, 40, 182-191]. In this study we examined the independent impact of different comorbid diagnostic categories on psychosocial morbidity in psychiatric outpatients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).\nParticipants were drawn from a pool of 1000 psychiatric outpatients interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV diagnoses (SCID-IV; [First, M.B., Spitzer, R.L., Williams, J.B.W., Gibbon, M., 1995.

We compared the demographics, clinical characteristics, and psychosocial functioning of depressed outpatients with and without different axis I comorbidities, then conducted multivariate analyses to determine the respective impact of comorbid axis I disorders.\nThree hundred and seventy-three patients had a principal diagnosis of unipolar MDD. One hundred twenty-nine (34.6%) were diagnosed with MDD only, and 244 (65.4%) had MDD and at least one other axis I disorder. Comorbidity was associated with longer duration of index episode, more psychiatric morbidity, and more social and occupational impairment. There was also a significant relationship between increasing number of comorbid axis I disorders and greater psychiatric and psychosocial impairment. In regression analyses, comorbidity burden (i.e., the number of comorbid axis I disorders) showed the strongest relation to psychiatric and psychosocial impairment.\nThis is not a random sample of depressed outpatients and, thus, may not be generalizable to all outpatients with depression. Second, Axes II and III comorbidity were not assessed.\nComorbidity burden showed the strongest relation to impairment over and above the presence of any particular class of disorders."}, {"Title": "Long-term naturalistic treatment of depressive symptoms in bipolar illness with divalproex vs. lithium in the setting of minimal antidepressant use.", "Abstract": "Risks have been associated with the long-term use of antidepressant in the treatment of bipolar disorder.

I therefore investigated the coverage in relevant textbooks.\nI searched the indices of books on Animal Behaviour, General Psychology and General Psychiatry for entries on Hierarchy, Territory and Dominance.\nA paradox is revealed. Hierarchical and territorial behaviour are widespread in both animals and humans but are neglected in textbooks of human behaviour and mental problems. Four hypotheses are put forward to explain this paradox and explore its implications. 1. That hierarchical and territorial behaviours evolved before human consciousness. They are available to consciousness but not in the forefront of awareness. 2. That human hierarchical and territorial behaviour are overlaid by a cultural veneer of manners, which conceal the true state of affairs. 3. That humans have internal, mental, hierarchical aims in addition to external physical hierarchical aims. 4. That failure to achieve internal hierarchical aims may produce diminution of well being and changes in behaviour by the same biological mechanisms that are active in external hierarchical defeat. Three testable predictions follow from these hypotheses. 1. That there are common genetic factors and similar patterns of brain activity in homologous structures during hierarchical and territorial behaviour in man, primates and lower vertebrates. 2. That brain structures involved in external hierarchical conflict, consciousness and imagery will be active during internal hierarchical conflict. 3. Defeat of internal hierarchical aims produce depressed mood and satisfying alternative hierarchical aims are protective. Case examples are given to illustrate the existence of, and the consequences of defeat on, internal hierarchies.\nThese hypotheses and predictions are theoretical and require confirmation or refutation by neuroimaging and prospective studies.\nA neglect of human hierarchical behaviour by clinicians is suggested and discussed. The concept of internal hierarchies, if confirmed, may throw light on human striving, the emotions of defeat and the therapy of depression."}, {"Title": "Post-modernity and post-traumatic stress disorder.", "Abstract": "The after effects of trauma have assumed a central role in the discourses of psychiatry and psychology in recent years.

The advent of post-modernity has witnessed an undermining of social stability and coherence and a systematic weakening of those cultural institutions which provide meaning and order for individuals. Following trauma, the development of the characteristic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is currently understood to arise from a breakdown of meaning within the victim's world.

However, studies in which schizophrenic patients have been followed for more than ten years are rare. In this study, the course and outcome of first-admission schizophrenic patients in Jichi Medical School Hospital was investigated.\nThe subjects were 62 schizophrenic patients, 29 females and 33 males (the mean age at first hospitalization was 25.2 +/- 7.4 years), who were consecutively discharged from the Department of Psychiatry, Jichi Medical School Hospital, between June 1983 and May 1988. The mean interval between first-admission and follow-up was thirteen years. The social outcome was measured using Eguma's Social Adjustment Scale. The subjects were divided into two groups according to Eguma's Scale: a favorable outcome group and an unfavorable outcome group. The following data were obtained from clinical records and analyzed: sex, family history of mental disorders, educational background, job experience, marital status, age at first contact to a psychiatrist, age at first hospitalization, type of onset, subtype of schizophrenia (paranoid, catatonic, hebephrenic types) and symptoms at the time of first hospitalization. Symptoms at the time of first hospitalization included delusions, hallucinations, disorders of ego consciousness, thought disorders, emotional disturbances, lack of spontaneity, catatonic symptoms, hypochondriac-cenestopathic symptoms, disorganized behavior, and suicide attempts.\nFifty-six of the 62 patients were followed-up. Six patients could not be contacted. Nine of the 56 patients follow-up were dead; two had died suddenly and seven had committed suicide. Forty-seven patients were alive, eight of which were not under psychiatric treatment, while 39 patients were receiving treatment (33 as outpatients, 6 as inpatients). The 47 patients who were still living were divided into two groups: 22 were included in the favorable outcome group, and 25 in the unfavorable outcome group. No significant differences in premorbid status were found. The unfavorable outcome group had an earlier age at first contact and age at first admission than the favorable outcome group. In the favorable outcome group, acute onset was more common than chronic onset. A comparison of psychopathological symptoms at the time of first hospitalization between the favorable and unfavorable outcome groups revealed significant differences in lack of spontaneity and hypochondriac-cenestopathic symptoms. No significant differences were found for any other symptoms. In the favorable outcome group, paranoid type was more common than hebephrenic type.\nLack of spontaneity may reflect negative symptomatology, which has been suggested to be a predictor of an unfavorable outcome. While hypochondriac-cenestopathic symptoms may reflect an insufficient psychic container for the body, which has been hypothesized to work as an enabler of body image or imaginary body and an enabler of ego function as well.\nFirst-admission schizophrenic patients followed up after a mean period of thirteen years, and of this group data could be obtained on 90% of them.

Depending on time and place, one of the two aspects would dominate while the other would serve as supporting motive. The subject of this article is to examine selected models of family care in Germany at different times as to their aim regarding the social integration of psychiatric patients. The family care patients not only lived outside the psychiatric hospitals, but were usually employed in household, farming or trade of the foster home. So the integrative potential of family care was, and still is, aimed at establishing a living and working condition as \"normal\" as possible. Until 1945, patients who could not or were not allowed to return to a completely independent lifestyle, family care offered them the widest range of integration and freedom. The often observed long lasting stays in families, reflect this rise in quality of life, although many were formally still associated with the mental institution. Up to the fifties, family care can be evaluated as an attempt of psychiatric hospitals to encounter the social isolation of the mentally ill. Nowadays family care is seeing a certain renaissance as part of social psychiatry. It is however not always clear whether family care can serve as a mean of real integration in the sense of a completely independent living and working condition, or whether it leads only to an, even if permanent, extramural accommodation of the chronically ill patients."}, {"Title": "[A zoologist on a different path--Richard B.

To further this inquiry, the authors conducted an expanded survey among the membership of the American Association of Community Psychiatrists (AACP). We mailed a questionnaire to all AACP members. Respondents categorized their positions as staff psychiatrist, program medical director or agency medical director, and rated their overall job satisfaction. The form also included a number of demographic and job characteristic items. Of 479 questionnaires mailed, a total of 286 individuals returned questionnaires (61%-12 forms were undeliverable). As in our previous survey, medical directors experience significantly higher job satisfaction compared to staff psychiatrists. Program and agency medical directors do not differ significantly. In addition, job satisfaction is strongly and negatively correlated with age for staff psychiatrists but not for medical directors. This survey strengthens the previously reported advantage medical directors have over staff psychiatrists regarding job satisfaction. The finding that job satisfaction decreases with increasing age of staff psychiatrists but not medical directors is particularly interesting, suggesting that staff psychiatrist positions may come to be regarded as \"dead-end\" over time. Psychiatrists are advised to seek promotions to program medical director positions early in their careers, since these positions are far more available, and provide equal job satisfaction, compared to agency medical director positions."}, {"Title": "Lack of association between a functional polymorphism of the cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) gene and tardive dyskinesia in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a common side effect of long-term medication with typical neuroleptics. TD presents itself by abnormal involuntary movements and may lead to a potentially disabling and chronic clinical course. A vast majority of patients suffering from schizophrenia are smokers. Smoking has been reported to induce the activity of the CYP1A2 enzyme, which is an established metabolic pathway within the disposition of antipsychotics. Recently, a C-->A genetic polymorphism in the first intron of the CYP1A2 gene was reported to influence CYP1A2 activity in smokers. Subsequently, a pharmacogenetic study in 85 U.S. patients with schizophrenia (44 smokers, 41 individuals with unknown smoking status) showed the C/C genotype to be associated with higher TD severity (measured by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, AIMS) than the A/C or A/A genotype. This finding prompted us to investigate whether this effect was also present in a larger German sample of 119 patients with schizophrenia (82 smokers, 37 individuals with unknown smoking status). However, we could not replicate the reported association. The median AIMS scores did not differ between individuals with the A/A, A/C, or C/C genotypes. In an additional analysis, we compared the genotypic and allelic distribution among individuals grouped according to the criteria established by Schooler and Kane [1982: Arch Gen Psychiatry 39:486-487] (persistent TD vs. absent TD).

Particular attention is given to issues related to forensic and ethical subjects. The UN proposals constitute a most laudable reform-inducing guideline for global mental health care systems, especially because of their emphasis on the preservation of mental patients' basic human rights. The proposals' strength springs from their influence regarding the prevention of misuse of psychiatry with focus on the care of inpatients and control over executive agencies. The detailed analysis of the similarities between the Israeli and Russian legislative approach reveals some badly matched organizational structure of many articles in comparison with the UN mandate.

This framework's formalism is general enough to be applied in other domains, such as biology or psychology, where complex systems are the rule rather than the exception. Our goal is to show here that this framework can become a valuable tool in scientific fields such as neuroscience and psychiatry where objects possess natural time dependency (i.e. dynamical properties) and non-linear characteristics. The application of non-linear dynamics concepts on these topics is more precise than a loose metaphor and can throw a new light on mental functioning and dysfunctioning. A class of neural networks (recurrent neural networks) constitutes an example of the implementation of the dynamical system concept and provides models of cognitive processes (15). The state of activity of the network is represented in its state space and the time evolution of this state is a trajectory in this space. After a period of time those networks settle on an equilibrium (a kind of attractor). The strength of connections between neurons define the number and relations between those attractors. The attractors of the network are usually interpreted as \"mental representations\". When an initial condition is imposed to the network, the evolution towards an attractor is considered as a model of information processing (27). This information processing is not defined in a symbolic manner but is a result of the interaction between distributed elements. Several properties of dynamical models can be used to define a way where the symbolic properties emerge from physical and dynamical properties (28) and thus they can be candidates for the definition of the emergence of mental properties on the basis of neuronal dynamics (42). Nevertheless, mental properties can also be considered as the result of an underlying dynamics without explicit mention of the neuronal one (47). In that case, dynamical tools can be used to elucidate the Freudian psychodynamics (34, 35). Recurrent neuronal networks have been used to propose interpretation of several mental dysfunctions (12). For example in the case of schizophrenia, it has been proposed that troubles in the cortical pruning during development (13) may cause a decrease in neural network storage ability and lead to the creation of spurious attractors. Those attractors do not correspond to stored memories and attract a large amount of initial conditions: they were thus associated to reality distorsion observed in schizophrenia (14). Nevertheless, the behavior of these models are too simple to be directly compared with real physiological data. In fact, equilibrium attractors are hardly met in biological dynamics. More complex behaviors (such as oscillations or chaos) should thus to be taken into account. The study of chaotic behavior have lead to the development of numerical methods devoted to the analysis of complex time series (17). These methods may be used to characterise the dynamical processes at the time-scales of both the cerebral dynamics and the clinical symptoms variations. The application of these methods to physiological signals have shown that complex behaviors are related to healthy states whereas simple dynamics are related to pathology (8). These studies have thus confirmed the notion of \"dynamical disease\" (20, 21) which denotes pathological conditions characterised by changes in physiological rhythms. Depression has been studied within this framework (25, 32) in order to define possible changes in brain electrical rhythms related to this trouble and its evolution. It has been shown that controls' brain dynamics is more complex than depressive one and that the recovery of a complex brain activity depends on the number of previous episodes. In the case of the symptoms time evolution, several studies have demonstrated that non-linear dynamical process may be involved in the recurrence of symptoms in troubles such as manic-depressive illness (9) or schizophrenia (51). These observations can contribute to more parcimonious interpretation of the time course of these illnesses than usual theories. In the search of a relationship between brain dynamics and mental troubles, it has been shown in three depressed patients an important correlation between the characteristics of brain dynamics and the intensity of depressive mood (49). This preliminary observation is in accordance with the emergence hypothesis according which changes in neuronal dynamics should be related to changes in mental processes. We reviewed here some theoretical and experimental results related to the use of \"physical\" dynamical theory in the field of psychopathology. It has been argued that these applications go beyond metaphor and that they are empirically founded. Nevertheless, these studies only constitute first steps on the way of a cautious development and definition of a \"dynamical paradigm\" in psychopathology. The introduction of concepts from dynamics such as complexity and dynamical changes (i.e. bifurcations) permits a new perspective on function and dysfunction of the mind/brain and the time evolution of symptoms. Moreover, it offers a ground for the hypothesis of the emergence of mental properties on the basis of neuronal dynamics (42). Since this theory can help to throw light on classical problems in psychopathology, we consider that a precise examination of both its theoretical and empirical consequences is requested to define its validity on this topic."}, {"Title": "[A psychiatrist under the Nazi dictatorship--Karl Bonhoeffer's commitment to racially and politically persecuted colleagues].", "Abstract": "Karl Bonhoeffer (1868-1948), professor of psychiatry at Breslau University and head of the psychiatric department of the Charit\u00e9-hospital in Berlin, represented a view of personnel politics based solely on scientific and as personal competence. Anti-Semitism, often attributed to the faculty in Berlin during the Wilhelminian period and the Republic of Weimar, B. regarded as an utterly unsuitable criterion of personnel politics. Consequently, he had a considerable number of Jewish assistants as staff, about 30 altogether. In 1933, when massive persecution set in, quite a few of his students and assistants were persecuted for their political views. Some emigrated right away; others Bonhoeffer re-employed in spite of their membership in illegal leftist parties. Even larger was the number of assistants who were racially persecuted. Bonhoeffer took advantage of loop holes in the anti-Semitic legalities, using complaints at the ministry or cleverly written applications to extend contracts even against high odds. In spite of his support, however, they eventually were fired and had to emigrate. They often found work in other countries because of his recommendations, though. For at least one assistant and one patient as well as their families, Bonhoeffer's commitment saved their lives."}, {"Title": "Family carers and the adult head-injured: a critical review of carers' needs.", "Abstract": "To appraise recent literature on the topic of perceived needs of family carers of head-injured adult relatives.

At first feminist bioethicists focused mainly on issues of particular concern to women such as reproduction. Recently, papers have begun to appear that show that a feminist analysis can be brought to bear on any subject traditional bioethics discusses. So far, however, feminist bioethics has not been brought to bear on psychiatry. There have been feminist critiques of psychiatry and feminist discussions of certain diagnostic categories that disproportionately affect women, but these are concerned with women's issues within psychiatry and how psychiatry has been used to oppress women. Certainly these are important, but what has been missing is a discussion of psychiatry in the sense that feminist bioethics suggests a general critique of psychiatry and the rethinking of the practice of psychiatry, regardless of whether the specific instances involved are women's issues. In this paper I look at what such a feminist bioethical intervention into psychiatry would look like."}, {"Title": "Approaches to gene mapping in complex disorders and their application in child psychiatry and psychology.", "Abstract": "Twin studies demonstrate the importance of genes and environment in the aetiology of childhood psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.

All subjects were psychiatric outpatients in the Institute of Psychiatry, Calcutta, and met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV criteria for a major depressive episode. Only 5 patients (17.2%) identified sadness as the most troubling problem, and 48.3% specified pains and other somatic symptoms instead. An internally consistent stigma scale with Cronbach's alpha of .67, comprised 13 items, was used to assess stigma. In addition to the scale score for each subject, the contribution of each item was reported and compared. A suggestive, though not significantly lower value of the stigma score for patients reporting somatic symptoms as most troubling, compared with sadness, was consistent with findings from prior studies showing a positive relationship between the magnitude of depression and stigma.

The nature of this evidence, its implications, its shortcomings, and its effect upon the ethics of treating schizophrenia are elaborated and discussed.

Our perspective is based on 16 years of clinical and research experience with young people at this phase of illness as well as the research contributions of many others. We discuss the ethical dilemmas in relation to the three key foci, which make up the early psychosis paradigm. These are the pre-psychotic or prodromal phase, the period of untreated psychosis and the first psychotic episode and the critical period of recovery, which follows this. Most attention is devoted to the pre-psychotic period, however ethical considerations related to research in the other two clinical foci are briefly covered as well. Our contention is that the ethical issues are essentially identical to those arising in early intervention research in mainstream medicine. This has been concealed by inconsistency and emotion, which has great potential to confuse, politicize and derail rational debate. The legacy of the isolation of psychiatry from medicine and consequent prejudice and stigma in the professional as well as the public mind seems to be fueling a tendency in some societies to view psychiatric research as qualitatively different from other medical research. Sound clinical research data should be allowed to illuminate the options for potential consumers across all phases of illness.

As a result of at least four developments, psychiatry is re-orientating in a more dimensional and functional direction in order to adapt to the progress in the neurosciences. Rigid adherence to nosological systems should be replaced by a careful observation and description of psychopathology as well as a search for relevant psychological dysfunctions and their putative pathophysiological basis. Psychotropics have to be developed that do not suppress symptoms but promote potentially intact functions. Emphasis should be given to the brain mechanisms that are involved in habit formation and chronicity. Modern genetics will drive the discipline towards early intervention and prevention and will elucidate the relations between genetic disorders and the behavioural phenotype.

Neuropsychological test batteries like the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery or Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery were not used. The majority of patients were, however, assessed by intelligence scales like the WAIS-R. The questionable reliability and validity of the projective tests, and the risk of subjective interpretations, raise a problem when used in a forensic setting, since the courts' decisions about a sentence to prison or psychiatric care is based on the forensic psychiatric assessment.

This convergence was attributable on the one hand to a fear of social disintegration and the consequences of modernization, and on the other hand to a widespread belief in scientific progress. The nineteenth century concept of individual integrity and a right to cultural education was now replaced by collective approaches emphasizing the role of society as a whole (the \"masses\") and heredity. During the next few decades eugenic approaches to the treatment of \"asocial elements\" and minorities predominated. Rather than deriving, as claimed, from scientific principles, these approaches were often based on cultural argumentation. The trend was more toward a culturalization of the scientific and medical discourse than toward a biologization of thinking with regard to society. A good many areas in this connection have hardly been researched yet. Interdisciplinary studies would be required to elucidate the relationships between medically defined \"health\" and socially defined \"normality\", the intertwinement of disciplines, and the implementation of scientific concepts into social and political models."}, {"Title": "High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral cortex: EEG topography during waking and subsequent sleep.", "Abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a novel research tool in neurology and psychiatry. It is currently being evaluated as a conceivable alternative to electroconvulsive therapy for the treatment of mood disorders. Eight healthy young (age range 21-25 years) right-handed men without sleep complaints participated in the study. Two sessions at a 1-week interval, each consisting of an adaptation night (sham stimulation) and an experimental night (rTMS in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or sham stimulation; crossover design), were scheduled. In each subject, 40 trains of 2-s duration of rTMS (inter-train interval 28 s) were applied at a frequency of 20 Hz (i.e. 1600 pulses per session) and at an intensity of 90% of the motor threshold. Stimulations were scheduled 80 min before lights off. The waking EEG was recorded for 10-min intervals approximately 30 min prior to and after the 20-min stimulations, and polysomnographic recordings were obtained during the subsequent sleep episode (23.00-07.00 h). The power spectra of two referential derivations, as well as of bipolar derivations along the antero-posterior axis over the left and right hemispheres, were analyzed. rTMS induced a small reduction of sleep stage 1 (in min and percentage of total sleep time) over the whole night and a small enhancement of sleep stage 4 during the first non-REM sleep episode. Other sleep variables were not affected. rTMS of the left dorsolateral cortex did not alter the topography of EEG power spectra in waking following stimulation, in the all-night sleep EEG, or during the first non-REM sleep episode.

The patient's characteristics, DSM-IV disorders, and actual sentences were obtained by studying their files. In order to obtain measures on their personality traits, self-report inventories were administered to the patients. Eighteen out of 60 patients were FZ abusers, but only 4 of them received a diagnosis related to the FZ abuse during the ordinary FPA. In almost all cases, however, indications of the FZ abuse were found in the files. No differences in personality traits were found between the groups. The frequency of previous admissions to an FPA and actual sentences of robbery, weapons offenses, narcotic-related offenses, and other crimes (such as theft) among the FZ abusers deviated significantly from forensic non-FZ abusers. Therefore, the FZ abuse per se might be more responsible for their tendency to commit crimes characterized by danger and thrill-seeking (such as robbery, weapons offences, and theft) than personality. The most important conclusion is that assessment of FZ abuse is needed in forensic psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Expert witness billing practices revisited: a pilot study of further data.", "Abstract": "This pilot study follows up an earlier study of the strategies and rationales by which psychiatric expert witnesses bill for their time on a case.

The reductionist/materialist position seems incontrovertible and self-evident. An important factor in maintaining this stance is the belief that the physical world is understandable, solid, unproblematic, especially when compared to the realm of the psychological. Developments in quantum and relativity theories, however, cast doubt on that belief. They show the fundamental nature of the material world to be problematic, enigmatic, paradoxical, impossible to understand or conceptualize in terms of everyday experience. This insight weakens the prima facie case for privileging the material over the psychological, and alternative (i.e., nonneurobiological) approaches to mental health matters should, therefore, be able to compete on an equal footing. However, the materialist-reductionist stance is kept in place by powerful forces and is well defended; rational arguments alone are unlikely to have an impact. This pervasive ideological resistance to rational, often well-founded critiques of physical reductionism continues to be a major impediment to changing the present materialist climate.

The questionnaire consisted of indirect attitude measures towards psychotherapy (associations and connotations), a likelihood rating for future training in psychotherapy, a statement about one's most preferred medical specialty for one's future career, and basic demographics.\nParticipants' pre-interventional connotations of psychotherapy were predominantly positive. In the pre-post comparison, more than one third of the connotation measures shifted substantially and favorably. Post-interventionally, participants' distinctive static word association style regarding psychotherapy was attenuated in favor of a more differentiated style and an enlarged field of associations. The data are suggestive of significant pre-interventional sex differences, with females holding more positive views towards psychotherapy and reporting a greater likelihood of future psychotherapeutic training. The data also suggest that the intervention acted differently upon the sexes. Likelihood ratings for future training in psychotherapy did not decline after the course, despite the fact that the cost and duration of training were mentioned in the course.\nEven minimal educational interventions can enhance medical students' predominantly positive attitudes towards psychotherapy.

However, a few observations have indicated that variables associated to rapid eye movement sleep take longer to stabilize. Notwithstanding, current opinion holds that second nights of recording can be used without restriction for research and clinical purposes. The goal of this study was to describe the dynamics of habituation to polysomnography in optimal conditions. Twenty-six young, carefully screened, healthy subjects were recorded in their home for four consecutive full polysomnographies. Repeated measures ANOVA were applied. Between the two first nights, while there were no differences in sleep duration in non-rapid eye movement sleep, marked modifications in corresponding spectral power were observed. The dynamics of adaptation of rapid eye movement sleep appeared to be a process extending up to the fourth night. Similar dynamics in NREMS and REMS homeostasis have been observed in sleep deprivation studies, and it appears that the same mechanisms may be responsible for the FNE. The longer habituation process of REMS in particular has important implications for sleep research in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Excessive daytime sleepiness: a challenge for the practising neurologist.", "Abstract": "The complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness, commonly encountered in neurological practice, may arise from a variety of disorders. The list of possibilities spans virtually every major area of medicine, neurology and psychiatry. A clear, detailed history is invaluable in negotiating these numerous diagnostic considerations; however, the symptom may be expressed in terms that do not directly denote somnolence (e.g. 'tiredness' or 'fatigue'). Accurate diagnosis is important, not only because of the negative impacts of sleepiness and its root causes on health and social function, but because excessive sleepiness is generally remediable with appropriate treatment.

This is an electronic documentation and quality measurement system with a large data-collecting function to record longitudinal data of the full psychiatric visit, covering all aspects of an evaluation and follow-up. Using the full ICD-10 and DSM-IV classifications, the system has been designed to assist with quality measurement in all psychiatric diagnoses. A full statistical package is included in the program to calculate outcomes of treatment (including relapse rates, improvements in psychopathology, severity and frequency of side-effects, and costs of treatment) as tables and graphs ready for presentation in a Powerpoint format. The system is fully translatable and flexible for various implementation settings, including stand-alone PCs or hospital network systems, all ICD-10 or DSM-IV diagnoses, and the possibility of the use of over 20 psychopathology and side-effect scales to measure the quality of care of all psychiatry patients."}, {"Title": "Quality management in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Over the past 50 years, treatment possibilities in psychiatry have drastically improved, but the results we actually achieve under everyday treatment conditions fall far short of what could be accomplished. Quality management represents a suitable method of reducing this gap. Although it has been successfully practiced in other medical disciplines for a long time, its implementation in psychiatry has previously been restricted to pilot projects. Quality management programs in psychiatry have been slow to be accepted because, up to now, only a few mental health professionals have received training in quality management techniques. In order to compensate for this information deficit and to familiarize psychiatrists and other mental health care workers with this increasingly important topic, we will provide in this paper a brief survey of the most important principles and techniques of quality management. This information should encourage psychiatrists to apply this new method to their own areas of responsibility. The results of one of our own studies on schizophrenic outpatients, which are presented at the end of the paper, are intended to show that the outcome can be improved and costs reduced by implementing quality management programs in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Who is interested in the quality of everyday psychiatric care?", "Abstract": "In the past 50 years the treatment possibilities have drastically improved, but the treatment results achieved under everyday care conditions mainly lag far behind those that could actually be achieved.

It follows from considerations of terminology and the critique of knowledge that on the basis of its taxonomic function logically and unambiguously determined by Hempel and in particular by Oppenheim, type, in contrast to class, is capable of categorizing majorities with blurred dividing lines. It was in this function that the concept of type entered psychology through W. Stern as a means of systematically categorizing the multiplicity of psychological varieties in different groups of persons, whereby the polar definition of the type concept as developed by Krueger and Wellek in genetic holistic psychology proved to be taxonomically effective. Type gained significance in psychiatry as polarity, in particular in the framework of research into constitution and psychopathy. Anglo-Saxon criticism of the concept of type and the evident differences between American DSM psychiatry and the German concept of type are examined. The current methods of typological research in psychiatry have been developed in the preceding thirty years mainly by Zerssen and his team using modern uni- and multivariate statistical methods and successfully applying them. As a result, it was possible to objectify in several studies in the meantime Tellenbach's typus melancholicus, the typus manicus (v. Zerssen), as well as the typus migraenicus (Peters) as premorbid personality types. In addition, a circular typology of personality variants is beginning to emerge ever more clearly in the latest studies on the basis of which it may be possible to identify individual personality disorders typologically."}, {"Title": "Prospects for antidepressant drug discovery.", "Abstract": "Recent socioeconomic analyses found that depression is a leading cause of disability and a major risk factor for development of other diseases. Moreover, on a world-wide scale depression is underdiagnosed and undertreated. Current antidepressant drugs have proven to be effective, but are burdened with slow onset of action and side effects. Above this, it is still unclear by which pharmacological mode of action they exert their clinical effects. Hypothesis-driven research based upon the corticosteroid receptor hypothesis of depression has led to a novel concept focusing on brain neuropeptide receptors, specifically the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor as drug target. This treatise expands on this new development, its background and its promises including first clinical experiments. In the era of functional genomics, however, hypothesis-driven research will be complemented by a new strategy that relies on a 'bottom up' search for new drug targets through screening techniques that range from the use of DNA microarrays, searches of compound libraries to behavioral screens of mouse mutants, just to name a few. In this sense, biotechnology opens up new chances for drug development through serendipity by providing new data bases on which systematic biological research in psychiatry and psychology can be conducted."}, {"Title": "Antidepressants during pregnancy and lactation: defining exposure and treatment issues.", "Abstract": "The majority of psychiatric illness onsets early in an individual's life, typically before or during the reproductive years. The increased incidence of major depression, dysthymia, and panic disorder in women compared with men underscores the likelihood that the clinician will encounter the clinical dilemma of medication use during pregnancy and lactation. The emergence of specialized clinics at several academic centers specifically to investigate and address issues in Perinatal psychiatry illustrates this conundrum best. The extant literature derived from human studies suggests that maternal mental illness and stress may have an adverse impact on obstetrical outcome. These clinical investigations are complemented by a burgeoning series of laboratory studies in rodents and nonhuman primates, showing the profound deleterious impact of maternal stress during the perinatal and neonatal periods on the development of the offspring. Data obtained from pharmaceutical registries, cohort studies, toxicology centers, and case series have consistently failed to show an adverse effect associated with in utero antidepressant exposure. Despite these advances and treatment guidelines proposed by the various academic leaders, investigations describing the extent of fetal/neonatal exposure, clinical methods for minimizing such exposure, and clinical treatment guidelines that include the physiological impact of pregnancy are sparse. The available literature shows distinct pharmacokinetic profiles of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in placental passage and breast milk. Preliminary animal studies have shown higher than expected central nervous system concentrations associated with exposure during pregnancy and mathematical modelling for calculating infant exposure when nursing. The clinical import of these data will require further investigations of central nervous system bioavailability in the fetus and neonate."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric disorders in cancer patients: descriptive analysis of 1721 psychiatric referrals at two Japanese cancer center hospitals.", "Abstract": "Although a diagnosis of cancer today may no longer be considered to be the equivalent of a death sentence, many previous studies in Western countries have revealed that such a diagnosis places many kinds of emotional burden on a patient.

This led to a return towards the concept of \"unitarian psychoses\" and thus to a revival of cross-sectional diagnoses. With the development of psychopharmacological compounds the need for exact demarcation of disease grew. Around this time syndromatological classification systems that were supposed to be used internationally have been developed. In the course of the last thirty years the argument about the meaning of psychiatric diagnoses rose anew; the necessity of standardized means of psychiatric diagnoses was contrasted by the fact that there was no way of defining disease entities for clinical research. A polydiagnostic approach as well as clinical diagnose of the illness course--using single symptoms as predictors of the disease's course--could point to a solution."}, {"Title": "The biology of family psychotherapy.", "Abstract": "This article has presented a view of biologic psychiatry consistent with that described by Bowlby, discussed hypotheses concerning the biologic purpose of the primate brain and the human brain, and challenged standard beliefs about the identity of the patient entity in a true biologically based psychiatry. Ideas developed by Whitaker, Malone, and their colleagues almost 50 years ago are consistent with a modern biologic basis of family psychotherapy. The treatment of an anorexic family was used to illustrate possible mechanisms of psychotherapeutic treatment requiring the presence of the whole family. The role of the psychiatrist who treats a family is to understand the biologic or medical importance of treating the family as a whole, communicate this to the family, continually work toward that level of participation, suggest relevant topics for discussion, and catalyze interactions within the family. Psychotherapy with families as a whole is effective because of the power of kin selection and inclusive fitness, biologic processes not usually considered in the practice of medicine or psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Child and adolescent psychiatry and family therapy. An overview.", "Abstract": "This article has provided an overview of the complex relationship between family therapy and child and adolescent psychiatry. Emphasis has been placed on the fact that the controversy and polarization that earlier characterized the relationship have delayed, but not blocked, the full integration of family therapy into child and adolescent psychiatry. Child psychiatrists and family therapists have been able to move beyond dichotomous polemics to combine the two fields in clinical practice, which has led to meaningful convergence in research and services. Family research has yielded important new directions for clinical practice in the areas of attachment, alcoholism, conduct disorder, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. It also has led to models of family continuity that have considerable potential for interrelating and possibly integrating different family therapy models. Family research also has uncovered family factors in the intergenerational transmission of psychopathology that can inform clinical practice. Convergence in the clinical domain has led to improved assessment and treatment across a wide range of child, adolescent, and family developmental, emotional, behavioral, and mental disorders. Finally, this article has reviewed the controversy over family systems therapy and the development of new directions in theory and practice to which this controversy has led. Despite the possibility that these new directions might lead to significant disruption and interference in the process of convergence, careful examination of the controversy and the new developments in practice suggests that rather than producing division between the two fields, the new developments, especially narrative therapy, are more likely to bring the two fields closer, particularly in the realm of interventive interviewing in family therapy."}, {"Title": "Group psychotherapy training and effectiveness.", "Abstract": "This study surveyed accredited programs in psychiatry, psychology, and social work, replicating and extending previous work in group training. Results detail the curriculum, group faculty/student participation, and predicted future therapy trends in four different formats of group treatment. The number of group courses in the curriculum, the number required, and the percent of students participating in these courses significantly varies among the three disciplines, indicating a discrepancy among those disciplines responsible for training in group therapy regarding the value and role of group training. Consensus does exist among the disciplines in forecasting that individual therapy will decrease and group treatment will increase, but what programs deliver in their training does not coincide with their predicted trends for group therapy use in the future.

Giving an overview on the available scientific literature we start by characterising therapeutic goals as a secondary psychological construction. Therapeutic goals and their multiple associations and different aspects of psychotherapy are discussed.

Students abroad were more oriented towards leadership and prestigious specialties, less preoccupied with the possibility of making medical mistakes, and less interested in medico-policial issues than their counterparts at home. Their personality profiles seemed more robust than those of students in Norway.

Data on severity included two measures of SRD-associated problems (one patient-rated and one psychiatrist-rated), substance abuse vs. dependence, self-help activities, and previous treatment. The study found that patients with CPA were more likely to be women, have lower socioeconomic status, and have more extended family members with substance abuse. Their substance abuse was more severe on five out of six severity measures. Patients with CPA showed more lifetime treatment on three out of four measures. Physical abuse during childhood resulted in a more morbid course of substance abuse later in adulthood.

For the first time world wide the attempt is undertaken to finance by a DRG-system--supplemented by certain additional charges and rebates--hospital costs completely. Institutions submitted to the psychiatry personnel regulation (PsychPV) are excluded. As the basis for the G-DRG-system self-administration authorities have selected the Australian AR-DRG system. The adjustment to German conditions is an extraordinary challenge: Compatibility must be achieved between the German classification of diagnoses (CGD-10) and procedures (OPS-301) and pertinent coding standards and the Australian classification systems. In the hospitals a unit cost accounting must be established, which at least approximately allows a strictly case-related calculation of actual costs. The relative cost weights of the DRGS and thus in the long run, their prices will be calculated on the basis the costs of a complete sample of cases of a representative subset of hospitals. The full-scale DRG system will confront with new risks.

However, the morphologic study of biopsy and autopsy material from children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is still of fundamental importance. The morphology has contributed remarkably to the progress in understanding the pathogenesis of the primary tissue lesions and of the sequelae directly or indirectly associated with HIV infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the HIV pathology in pediatric AIDS (PAIDS) through a systematic review of the English-language literature and to draw up a practical checklist protocol for the postmortem.\nInformation on HIV pathology in childhood was retrieved from a MEDLINE search (January 1994-January 2001) of the original reports and bibliographic article reviews published in English. Citations from papers retrieved were screened and retrieved papers were evaluated.\nBased on the screened data, we propose a practical, organ-oriented checklist protocol for the postmortem according to the HIV pathogenesis.\nEvidence-based medicine is a paradigm now exerting increasing influence in related fields such as surgery, general practice, psychiatry, and pathology. This article is a summary of the literature on PAIDS pathology. The protocol that we propose is particularly useful for pediatric pathology programs and for electronic data processing."}, {"Title": "[Psycho-oncology and its scientific background].", "Abstract": "Psycho-oncology has two purposes corresponding to the psychosocial aspects of cancer: 1. to clarify the psychosocial impacts of cancer on the quality of life of the patient, family and staff; 2. to clarify the role that psychosocial and behavioral variables may have in cancer risk and survival.

The authors discuss the issue of boundary violation allegations that arise after treatment has ended, with the goal of explicating how these issues have been handled in psychiatric discussions as well as in broader sociolegal settings.\nClinical illustrations and legal cases are used to illustrate how legal and administrative bodies have dealt with posttermination boundary issues.\nCourts and regulatory bodies have tended to use the psychoanalytic concept of transference to decide issues in which there has been a complaint of impropriety-be it romantic, financial, or social in nature-arising after termination of treatment. However, a multitude of treatment approaches are currently employed in psychiatry, and often their practitioners either do not use the concept of transference or deny its validity. If the concept is used, it is often present in many settings outside therapy.\nThe concept of transference is subject to continuing debate and modification within psychoanalysis, and its use in judicial or quasijudicial settings raises questions about whether it meets standards of scientific acceptance. Using the concept of transference to decide posttermination issues results not only in confusion but also has the potential for many adverse consequences for practitioners and the profession."}, {"Title": "A psychiatric dialogue on the mind-body problem.", "Abstract": "Of all the human professions, psychiatry is most centrally concerned with the relationship of mind and brain.

Psychiatric referrals of patients admitted to neurological wards were compared to referrals from other wards. Information was obtained from 33 neurological wards, consisting of 34,506 neurological admissions. Of these admissions, 839 were referred to C-L psychiatry. The median consult rate among the hospitals was 1.8%. Compared to other hospital wards, patients referred from neurology were more frequently diagnosed as suffering from somatoform (P<.01) and dissociative disorders (P<.01), and less from substance abuse (P<.01) and delirium (P<.01). Referral to C-L psychiatry from neurological wards is characterized by an underestimation of psychiatric co-morbidity and a late detection, comparable to other medical specialties. An appeal is made for a standardized referral procedure including admission screening method, detecting patients at risk for nonstandard care during their hospital admission."}, {"Title": "Phenotype definitions: some hidden issues in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Three hidden problems in phenotype definition in psychiatric genetic studies are described. 1. Data on physical conditions in family members are not routinely collected in genetic studies of psychiatric disorders. These data may reveal cosegregation with psychiatric disorders which can be included in genetic analysis when defining the phenotype. Data on physical conditions can be obtained by a combination of medical checklists, medical history, and medical records. 2. Detailed clinical narrative summaries should be prepared on family members even if the narratives are not part of the diagnostic data included in centralized cell repositories for future distribution to qualified genetic investigators. Means for retaining the narratives for future use, while protecting patient confidentiality, should be sought. The narratives include detailed information on the context, severity, and sequence of the symptoms and can provide phenotype descriptions for reconsideration of diagnosis in the future. 3. The selection of early onset psychiatric disorders for genetic studies does not automatically mean that affected children should be included in genetic studies for some psychiatric disorders. Screening for genetic studies among child psychiatric patients and inclusion of children as affected in pedigrees should proceed with caution until more data are available from longitudinal studies on the continuity between childhood and adult psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "A randomized evaluation of a computer-based nursing documentation system.", "Abstract": "A two-month randomized, controlled trial based on 60 patients has been performed on a ward of the Department of Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Medical Center, Germany, to investigate the influence of computer-based nursing documentation on time investment for documentation, quality of documentation and user acceptance. Time measurements, questionnaires, documentation analysis and interviews were used to compare patients documented with the computer-based system (PIK group) with the control group (patients documented with the paper-based system). The results showed the advantages and disadvantages of computer-based nursing documentation. Time needed for nursing care planning was lower in the PIK group. Some formal aspects of quality were considerably better in the PIK group. On the other hand, time required for documentation of tasks and for report writing was greater in the PIK group.

Clearly, the results of studies of that type do not provide a tool for the diagnostic assessment of whole series of measurements taken sequentially over time in the same individual. In this paper, the approach of Wellek & Merz (1995) to the construction of age-dependent reference ranges for cross-sectional measurements is generalized in such a way that data sets containing time series of arbitrary length varying between subjects can be accommodated. Since repeated measurements on the same subject are typically correlated, the regression function to be used as the central line for the reference band eventually obtained is determined by fitting a nonlinear mixed model describing the dependence of conditional means on age by growth functions of the same class we proposed in the case of cross-sectional data. Estimation of the parameters of this mixed model is done in a way closely related to the population-averaged GEE approach by Zeger et al. (1988). Given the regression line, the reference band is constructed by means of an iterative procedure guaranteeing that the proportion of observed profiles which nowhere leave the band, has some prespecified value (frequently set equal to 90% in practice). The approach is illustrated with two examples taken from child psychiatry and prenatal sonography."}, {"Title": "The emancipation of nursing practice: applying anti-psychiatry to the therapeutic community.", "Abstract": "This paper raises issues about the process and conduct of clinical relationships with people diagnosed as mentally ill who live in therapeutic communities. This clinical work is of particular importance in the late 1990s due to the changing socio-cultural climate of interaction with people living with mental illness. This climate has a focus of care on recovery in the community and not on long-term hospitalization. The paper takes the position of anti-psychiatry as a preferred model of intervention because it is person and not diagnosis oriented.

A fundamental question of what constitutes adequate technology for telepsychiatry remains unanswered. As technology and equipment capability change rapidly, a more important question may be what clinical decisions and behavioral observations are required to produce high standards of distance mental health care. Geriatric patients may have sensory impairments and unique aspects to their psychiatric problems that can make telemental health assessments more challenging.

The reforms of mental health care since the fifties were directed not only at the improvement of the treatment and the situation of psychiatric patients, but also at the reduction of prejudices and stigmata--i.e. a normalisation of the aforementioned special position. However, in connection with the stepwise progress of the reforms one could notice an increasing neglect of a subgroup of severely mentally ill who are not able to accept the offers of modern mental health care, or whose care-requirements are not met by the current developments. This together with the withdrawal of psychiatry from all those aspects of treatment, dealing with aggressive behaviour of or coercion against mentally ill led to a stepwise removal of certain patients--recruited mainly from the aforementioned subgroup--from the general mental health care system. Initially this development could be observed only in the USA, but in the meantime several European countries are appearing to catch up. This reinforces the prejudices against mental patients in general which are present up to now, is counterproductive with regard to the intended aims of mental health reforms and increases the danger of undifferentiated and restrictive political reactions."}, {"Title": "An examination of the diagnostic validity of dissociative identity disorder.", "Abstract": "We review the empirical evidence for the validity of the Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) diagnosis, the vast majority of which has come from research conducted within the last 10 years.

But this cannot lead to the conclusion that relatives are supporting the participation of an affected family member in research. The small number of relatives that fears a stigmatization by earlier diagnosis of schizophrenic psychosis shows that stigmatization depends on other factors than the diagnosis, i.e. psychiatric hospitalization or medication side effects.

We collected data from basic documentation and the multiaxial classification (MAS), using a variety of standard instruments such as Anis 32, MMPI, BDI, HAWIK-R and HAWIE.\nOur findings show significant differences between the two populations. At the time of their first admission anorectic patients were somewhat younger than their bulimic counterparts (14.5 years vs. 16.5 years, respectively). With regard to the typical symptoms of either disorder, the two populations differ in their eating behavior on the factor bulimia described by Anis-32. A comparison of personality features reveals that anorectic patients scored lower than bulimic patients on the MMPI scales, especially on psychopathology, but higher on depression in the BDI. Other characteristics of anorectic patients include a higher-than-average IQ, more enmeshment and overprotectiveness in family relations, more separation anxiety and insufficient communication skills at school.

As a result of novel magnetic resonance imaging techniques, the pathogenic characteristics of neuronal activity and connectivity can be examined in a noninvasive, safe, and repeatable manner. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) uses blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) measures for identifying the gray matter contribution to cognition. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) reveals the course and structural integrity of white matter projections. Because DTI does not require special motivation and performance, group differences in psychiatry are more easily interpreted in terms of underlying pathology. To date few studies have tried to investigate both, i.e. dynamic and microstructural data in the sense of a modern multi-dimensional investigation approach. The combination of both techniques, however, seems to offer a promising vehicle to further extent our current understanding of mental disorders and to identify populations at risk.

However, only a few studies have investigated objective assessment and quantification of impulsive behavior, which is relevant for psychiatric practice and research. Because new techniques enable objective assessment of behavior generation and execution, the current knowledge about neurophysiological aspects of behavioral control is summarized.\nThe contemporary literature on neuronal mechanisms of initiation and execution of behavior and movements and new neurophysiological methods and findings are discussed in respect to their application in psychiatry.\nBehavior, defined as movements of a body in time and space, is the result of cortical and subcortical processes. These consist of two general components: (1) perception and selection of a stimulus and (2) execution of a movement, including decision and planning phases. Planning and execution, modulated by cognition and emotions, are dependent on the balance of inhibitory and excitatory aspects of behavior control. Combined detection of electrical brain activity and kinematic analysis of peripheral movements enables the analysis of control mechanisms.\nImpulsiveness and inhibition of behavior depend on neuronal control mechanisms which can be analyzed by neurophysiological methods. Objective assessment of impulsive behavior related to psychiatric disturbances including eating disorders, substance abuse, and personality disorders may clarify underlying neurobiological mechanisms and enable rational pharmaco- and psychotherapeutic interventions."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatric emergencies in the physician-based system of a German city].", "Abstract": "Pre-clinical Psychiatric Emergency Situations (PES) gain more scientific interest. First investigations revealed them to be the third major cause for emergency physician (EP) calls. However, there is still very little data concerning prevalence, diagnosis and therapy.\nA retrospective analysis of all anonymised EP protocols of the year 1995 in the city of Hamburg was performed. Data of each multiple-choice category was evaluated as well as handwritten and personal notes to determine prevalence, diagnoses and therapy of PES.\n2550 out of 26,347 protocols (9.7%) revealed to have a psychiatric disturbance as a major cause for the call. The most frequent diagnoses in the overall young (average age: 43.1 +/- 17.6 years) and male (60.3%) population were found to be alcoholic intoxication (34%), state of agitation (23%) and suicide attempts (22%). In 55% the emergencies could be considered as purely psychiatric; in 35% as a combined somatic-psychiatric emergency. A specific psychopharmacological treatment was not performed.\nPsychiatric patients are a considerable group in pre-clinical emergency medicine, however, disturbances are much too rarely documented, diagnosed and treated. Training programs are necessary. Psychiatry has to play a more active role in planning and performing these programs."}, {"Title": "What it says in the papers: an audit.", "Abstract": "There have been concerns in the international literature that the manner in which psychiatry and psychiatric patients is portrayed in the print media is negative and sensational. If correct this has serious implications for the stigma and prejudice that our patients will suffer. This study was designed to evaluate the content and tone of articles relating to psychiatry. It was compared with a broadly similar study published in 1995 and will form the base from which to measure changes in psychiatric coverage over time.\nAll the daily broadsheets, one daily tabloid and three Sunday broadsheets were examined for a six month period in 1999 and all articles, letters or headlines incorporating psychiatry-related material were examined. Using specific definitions, articles and headlines were examined for tone and content as well as for the contribution of mental health professionals.\nOverall 0.65 articles per newspaper per day were found. News items and feature predominated, with forensic issues receiving the greatest attention. The tone of the articles was either neutral or positive and the improvement in the tone of articles in the tabloids was particularly noticeable when compared with an earlier study. This is very different from the findings of international studies. However, the headlines were more sensational in tone than the contents of the articles themselves. Increasingly the opinion of health professionals was sought but contributions from psychiatrists remained low, writing just two articles and constituting 15% of health professionals whose opinions were sought. Nine per cent of items constituted misuse of terms.\nThe Irish print media are not hostile to psychiatry and there has been an improvement in tone and type of article in the past five years. Greater involvement of psychiatrists in the media and particularly more direct engagement with editors is required if there is to be a shift from coverage of forensic matters in favour of informative articles as well as improvement in the headline tone."}, {"Title": "The butler(s) DID it - dissociative identity disorder in cinema.", "Abstract": "Beginning with classic Hollywood melodramas of the 1940s, cinema has maintained a prolific output of films with their own take on mental illnesses-none more so than the rare syndrome of dissociative identity disorder (DID). DID films are a popular and enduring genre, whose influence can be seen throughout mainstream cinema. Exploration of DID in cinema is a useful exercise in that it touches on issues in film studies, psychiatry and the mythology around mental illness. Despite \"detective story\" narratives and conformity to the codes of the psychological thriller, DID representations correspond closely to contemporary thinking about its phenomenology and aetiology. That said, some films confuse DID with schizophrenia, and many reinforce two other misconceptions within film psychiatry: mental illness as violence and the belief that every mentally ill person harbours one \"great dark secret\". Those sceptical about DID have suggested that popular written accounts increase its profile: so too, powerful cinematic images may suggest the possibility of DID to susceptible people, including clinicians. Recent DID films reflect the real debate within psychiatry about the diagnostic validity and scientific basis of DID."}, {"Title": "Depression in the planet's largest ethnic group: the Chinese.", "Abstract": "The authors reviewed the evidence for the claim that the Chinese tend to deny depression or express it somatically, examined the possible determinants of those characteristics, and explored implications of the findings for the diagnosis and management of depression in China and for psychiatry in the WEST:\nThis paper reviews and interprets original studies and literature reviews considering emotional distress, depression, neurasthenia, and somatization in Chinese subjects.\nInterpretation of the literature is complicated by the considerable heterogeneity among people described as \"the Chinese\" and by numerous factors affecting collection of data, including issues of illness definition, sampling, and case finding; differences in help-seeking behavior; idiomatic expression of emotional distress; and the stigma of mental illness. Despite difficulties in interpreting the literature, the available data suggest that the Chinese do tend to deny depression or express it somatically.\nThe existing evidence supports the hypothesis that the Chinese tend to deny depression or express it somatically. However, Western influences on Chinese society and on the detection and identification of depression are likely to have modified the expression of depressive illness quite sharply since the early 1980s. Analyzing these changes may provide useful insight into the evolution of the diagnosis of depression in Western and other cultures."}, {"Title": "Do high-threat life events really provoke the onset of psychiatric disorder in children?", "Abstract": "Studies on adults have suggested important effects of stressful life events in provoking onset of psychiatric disorder. Only a few comparable studies on children exist, and their results are inconsistent in relation to definite timing effects. Meeting some important methodological challenges overlooked in the past research, this study set out to examine whether the onset of psychiatric disorder in children was more likely to occur shortly after a severe event, as compared with other times. The sample consisted of 99 consecutive, newly referred patients, aged 8-16 years, from a child psychiatry service in London. PACE (Psychosocial Assessment of Childhood Experiences), an investigator-based, standardized interview was used to assess the timing and impact of life events over the preceding 18 months. CAPA (Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment), a standardized diagnostic assessment, was used to establish the presence, timing, and consequential impairment of child and adolescent psychiatric symptoms. In a within-subject, over-time design, conditional logistic regression techniques were employed to examine whether risk of onset was greater in the 9 weeks following a high-threat life event than at other times. There was a small but statistically significant association between child-reported events and child-reported onset; the associations with parent-reported onset were inconsistent. Parent-reported events failed to relate to onset by either source. The study offers only quite limited support to the notion of negative life events provoking onset of psychiatric disorder in children and young people. The possible reasons for this are discussed, together with important conceptual and methodological issues to problems of defining onset, and the choice of appropriate designs for data analysis."}, {"Title": "Sapir's vision of culture and personality.", "Abstract": "For Edward Sapir the concept of culture was a reification of processes that were rooted in individuals' personality and psychology. Sapir suggested that psychiatry's focus on individual biography and pathology gives it unique relevance for social science efforts to understand the mechanisms of cultural transmission and transformation. As a discipline that must integrate culture and biology in theory and practice, psychiatry can provide a corrective to the extremes of biological or cultural reductionism. Although mainstream psychiatry has largely abdicated the role it once had in the social sciences, the interdisciplinary field of cultural psychiatry may meet some of Sapir's hopes. Recent work in cultural psychiatry is centrally concerned with illness narratives that arise from the interaction of personal and collective meaning. Illness narratives may serve individual defensive functions, position individuals in a social world, and help to maintain overarching cultural formations. They also may challenge or subvert existing cultural meanings and create new forms of discourse. The close analysis of how cultural and individual meanings interact that is provided by cultural psychiatry has much to offer the wider field of cultural anthropology."}, {"Title": "Depression and social change. From transcultural psychiatry to a constructivist model.", "Abstract": "Based on the findings of previous studies carried out by our group, which will be briefly summarised, the present paper puts forward several hypotheses to account for the evolution of depressive symptoms and the possible increase observed in risk of depression subsequent to social changes. The particular mood disorders presented by Senegalese emigrants and several protective factors which appear to determine a low risk in these populations, such as a strong social support, will be examined. Based on a previous investigation carried out by our group, which seems to indicate the presence of depressive pictures among poorly westernised populations such as the Peul nomads or Dogon farmers from the Sub-Saharian regions, the hypothesis that \"westernalisation\" (considered as the loss at an individual level of traditional ways of life, working habits, cultural patterns and languages in favour of different attitudes influenced by western culture) may represent a risk factor for depressive illness, in its clinical expressions commonly observed in western contexts, has been considered. In these populations, with the exception of educated individuals, the albeit rare depressive symptoms appear to be secondary to serious somatic disorders. Research performed identified two well-defined means of clinical expression, which has been termed, respectively, \"western style\" or \"guilty\" and \"traditional\" or \"dislocation from the group\". Further studies carried out in rapidly changing areas seem to indicate how environmental factors are able to influence the evolution of depressive symptoms from the first form to the latter and to modify the threshold of onset of emotive, behavioural and depressive patterns. It has been hypothesised that rapid changes in the social organisation tend to exacerbate attitudes of \"compulsive hyper-responsibilisation\", a cognitive set of basic assumptions which may be considered at the same time both as a product of \"westernalization\" at an individual level and a risk factor for depression. Individuals who possess these basic characteristics, subsequent to the opportunities afforded by the social changes, tend to develop new complex systems of interpreting reality, causality, controlling of events and ways of expressing emotions. Accordingly, we herewith propose a reviewal of the entire threshold concept and provide a means of interpreting the transformation in depressive phenomena in view of the fact that, although the new levels of knowledge and learning better equip subjects to face the new situations, they also render them more vulnerable to depression."}, {"Title": "Epidemiology in community psychiatric research: common uses and methodological issues.", "Abstract": "Epidemiological principles underpin much medical research particularly that concerned with the planning and evaluation of health services, including research in community and social psychiatry.

The most important methodological issues include causal inference which in epidemiology takes the form of explaining the association between an exposure and disease (chance, bias, confounding, reverse causality and causality), the issue of confounding and how to adjust for it and issues arising in the context of specific study designs.\nEpidemiology has become a set of methods used to investigate a wide range of clinical questions.

Relapses appear unpredictable and occur even after long-term successful remission during antipsychotic treatment.\nSince rehabilitation efforts have effects only after long-term endeavours, antipsychotic relapse prevention should be maintained for long periods.

This review while not exhaustive, highlights recent findings of relevance to psychopharmacology.\nTo familiarize the reader with the technique and the findings from serotonergic knockout mice.\nInformation included in this review was drawn from our own experience in this field and relevant publications from other investigators.\nWe have focused on three main themes that have emerged from studies with mice bearing single-gene mutations of serotonergic genes: anxiety, aggression, and drug abuse. Mice lacking the 5-HT1A have been found to be more anxious in several behavioral paradigms. Elevated levels of aggression have been reported in mice lacking the monoamine oxidase A and the 5-HT1B receptor genes. The mice lacking the 5-HT1B receptor have also been reported to exhibit an increased vulnerability to cocaine. The molecular basis of this enhanced vulnerability has been linked to compensatory changes in the nucleus accumbens. These results and their correlation with pharmacological studies will be discussed.\nMice lacking key components of the serotonin system have provided us with important animal models of genetic vulnerability to conditions such as anxiety disorders, aggression, and drug abuse. Ongoing research with these mice may help elucidate the mechanistic functioning of this complex system."}, {"Title": "[Indicators of early Alzheimer dementia in family practice. Development and validation of the Observation List of Early Symptoms of Dementia (OLD)].", "Abstract": "Aim of the study was the development and validation of a short observation list of possible early signs of dementia (OLD) for use in general practice. A stepwise development was carried out using reviews of publications and expert consensus. Experimental observations were carried out by 22 general practitioners in 19 Dutch practices. A field study (with interviews and family forms) was conducted out afterwards, to evaluate reliability and validity. Data reduction techniques were used to construct a short version. The first two patients seen on 15 working days (N = 470) were observed.\nage > 75, without a known diagnosis of dementia. Exclusion: psychiatric treatment, severe depression, acute illness with confusion. The patients were divided into three groups with no, intermediate, and the most signs (total of interviewed patients n = 60; family forms n = 39). Cronbach's alpha and factor-analysis were used to evaluate the reliability. The Cognitive Screening Test (CST), the Word Learning Test (WLT; total and retention), the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE), the Groningen Activities Restriction Scale (GARS), and an IADL scale were used to evaluate convergent validity. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used to evaluate discriminant validity. Construct validity was evaluated using PRINCALS. Incremental validity was evaluated using the intuitive opinion of the GP (McNemar test). The reliability in the total group was 0.88, the first factor explained 42.5% of the variance. Convergent validity (2-side ANOVA) results: CST (p = 0.00), WLT-total (p = 0.001), WLT retention (p = 0.00), IQCODE (p = 0.09). No statistically significant differences were found for GARS and IADL. The GDS (p = 0.30) showed no difference. The first factor of PRINCALS explained 48% of the variance. The OLD added to the GP opinion (McNemar p = 0.00). Reliability of the short version (12 items) was 0.89 (interviewed group), and 0.86 (total group). The conclusion is that the OLD is a valid and reliable method to detect early signs of dementia in general practice. (Partly adapted from: Hopman-Rock M, Tak ECPM, Staats PGM.

At admission, severity of depressive symptoms was assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale and severity of chronic physical illness was measured using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (Geriatrics). HRQL was assessed at admission and again at 3 months postdischarge using the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 6-Item General Health Survey.\nThis study found large improvements in all MOS items between admission and 3 months postdischarge. Severity of chronic physical disease was negatively associated with the probability of improvement in three MOS items (role functioning, psychological functioning, and general health perceptions) whereas the severity of depressive symptoms on admission was negatively associated with the probability of improvement in role functioning, social functioning, and bodily pain. Living alone was negatively associated with social functioning but not with any of the other MOS items.\nThe results of this study suggest that the inpatient treatment of depression in the elderly brings about improvements in quality of life that persist for at least 3 months following discharge.

First, medical comorbidity may obscure the diagnosis. For example, the patient with multiple chronic illnesses will often have many \"vegetative\" symptoms of either dementia or depression (e.g., fatigue, loss of energy, poor appetite) attributed to the primary medical condition rather than to an underlying psychiatric illness. Second, the phenomenology of psychiatric illness in the elderly is often different. For example, depression in the elderly is often characterized by prominent anhedonia--loss of interest in virtually everything--and physical complaints leading to an unnecessary medical workup. Third, physicians are often reluctant to diagnose new-onset mental illness in their elderly patients. The fear of stigmatizing the patient or physician discomfort with \"psychologic language\" often results in underdetection of straightforward psychiatric syndromes. This article will focus primarily on detection of 3 of the most common psychiatric syndromes: dementia, depression, and delirium. The field of geriatric psychiatry has done a good job of characterizing the prevalence (Table I) and clinical features of these syndromes. The problem--briefly addressed here--is how to incorporate some of these findings into a busy clinical practice where there is very little time for the assessment of psychiatric symptoms."}, {"Title": "Psychostimulants in preschool children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: clinical evidence from a developmental disorders institution.", "Abstract": "To examine psychostimulant response in preschool children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in an outpatient child psychiatry clinic (housed within a developmental disorders institution) over 3, 12, and 24 months of treatment.\nA systematic retrospective chart review was conducted for 27 preschool children with ADHD who were started on psychostimulants between the ages of 3 and 5 years, inclusive.

Improved outcomes depend on improved recognition, and screening instruments need to be streamlined tremendously to be accepted by primary care providers.

Dementia praecox. Churchill Livingston Inc., New York) and Bleuler (1911/1950: Bleuler, E., 1911/1950. Dementia praecox or the group of schizophrenias. International Universities Press, New York), who first described 'dementia praecox' and the 'schizophrenias', were convinced that schizophrenia would ultimately be linked to an organic brain disorder. Alzheimer (1897: Alzheimer, A., 1897. Beitrage zur pathologischen anatomie der hirnrinde und zur anatomischen grundlage einiger psychosen. Monatsschrift fur Psychiarie und Neurologie. 2, 82-120) was the first to investigate the neuropathology of schizophrenia, though he went on to study more tractable brain diseases. The results of subsequent neuropathological studies were disappointing because of conflicting findings. Research interest thus waned and did not flourish again until 1976, following the pivotal computer assisted tomography (CT) finding of lateral ventricular enlargement in schizophrenia by Johnstone and colleagues. Since that time significant progress has been made in brain imaging, particularly with the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), beginning with the first MRI study of schizophrenia by Smith and coworkers in 1984 (Smith, R.C., Calderon, M., Ravichandran, G.K., et al. (1984). Nuclear magnetic resonance in schizophrenia: A preliminary study. Psychiatry Res. 12, 137-147). MR in vivo imaging of the brain now confirms brain abnormalities in schizophrenia. The 193 peer reviewed MRI studies reported in the current review span the period from 1988 to August, 2000. This 12 year period has witnessed a burgeoning of MRI studies and has led to more definitive findings of brain abnormalities in schizophrenia than any other time period in the history of schizophrenia research. Such progress in defining the neuropathology of schizophrenia is largely due to advances in in vivo MRI techniques. These advances have now led to the identification of a number of brain abnormalities in schizophrenia. Some of these abnormalities confirm earlier post-mortem findings, and most are small and subtle, rather than large, thus necessitating more advanced and accurate measurement tools. These findings include ventricular enlargement (80% of studies reviewed) and third ventricle enlargement (73% of studies reviewed). There is also preferential involvement of medial temporal lobe structures (74% of studies reviewed), which include the amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus, and neocortical temporal lobe regions (superior temporal gyrus) (100% of studies reviewed). When gray and white matter of superior temporal gyrus was combined, 67% of studies reported abnormalities. There was also moderate evidence for frontal lobe abnormalities (59% of studies reviewed), particularly prefrontal gray matter and orbitofrontal regions. Similarly, there was moderate evidence for parietal lobe abnormalities (60% of studies reviewed), particularly of the inferior parietal lobule which includes both supramarginal and angular gyri. Additionally, there was strong to moderate evidence for subcortical abnormalities (i.e. cavum septi pellucidi-92% of studies reviewed, basal ganglia-68% of studies reviewed, corpus callosum-63% of studies reviewed, and thalamus-42% of studies reviewed), but more equivocal evidence for cerebellar abnormalities (31% of studies reviewed). The timing of such abnormalities has not yet been determined, although many are evident when a patient first becomes symptomatic. There is, however, also evidence that a subset of brain abnormalities may change over the course of the illness. The most parsimonious explanation is that some brain abnormalities are neurodevelopmental in origin but unfold later in development, thus setting the stage for the development of the symptoms of schizophrenia. Or there may be additional factors, such as stress or neurotoxicity, that occur during adolescence or early adulthood and are necessary for the development of schizophrenia, and may be associated with neurodegenerative changes. Importantly, as several different brain regions are involved in the neuropathology of schizophrenia, new models need to be developed and tested that explain neural circuitry abnormalities effecting brain regions not necessarily structurally proximal to each other but nonetheless functionally interrelated.

The applications of such techniques to problems in biological psychiatry are manifold and the implications of discovering novel and/or known genes that are perturbed in neuropsychiatric disorders profound. While there are success stories, it is becoming ever more apparent that each of these techniques has its limitations, particularly when applied to the central nervous system. Given that these methods (e.g. differential display, RNA fingerprinting, suppression-subtractive hybridization, microarrays) are labour-intensive and potentially time-consuming, it is important to understand these limitations. For example, differential display is capable of detecting very small changes in the expression of mRNA species. Methods like suppression-subtractive hybridization are better suited to examine potential differences in rare transcripts, but only when their expression is changed substantially (currently ? 5-fold). Moreover, both the functional and morphological organization of the central nervous system present challenges that may not be encountered in other systems. In this overview, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of some of these approaches and their application to research in biological psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Impaired sleep during the post-alcohol withdrawal period in alcoholic patients.", "Abstract": "Twenty-seven patients who suffered from alcohol dependence syndrome and who were admitted to the Department of Psychiatry at NCNP were investigated for impaired sleep. The incidence of \"insomnia night\", when a patient has trouble getting sufficient sleep even after taking additional drugs for insomnia, was used as the index for impaired sleep. \"Insomnia night\" was observed among 51.9% (14 of 27) of the patients during administration; 18.5% (nine of 27) experienced \"insomnia night\" only during the withdrawal period. The mean incidence was 3.5 nights of 10 nights for 0-9th day after abstinence and 2.0 nights of 10 nights for 10-19th day after abstinence; 33.3% (nine of 27) claimed \"insomnia night\" even after the withdrawal period and the highest incidence was the 160-169th day after abstinence, average frequency being 4.4 nights of 10 nights. Impaired sleep emerging after the withdrawal period neared the clinical course of Komiyama's protracted withdrawal symptoms, thus suggesting that it might be one of the protracted withdrawal symptoms."}, {"Title": "A screening instrument for language in older people (Barnes Language Assessment).", "Abstract": "This paper describes the development of a clinically viable tool for the assessment of language and associated cognitive skills in the older population which was instigated by the SIG Psychiatry of Old Age (South of England).

The establishment thereof and personnel recruiting were done in close operation with provincial authorities. In Niedermarsberg external nurses were also employed. When the activities in the Marsberger ward became public despite efforts to keep them secret, the provincial association felt forced to establish a replacement ward in Dortmund-Aplerbeck. This ward was integrated stronger into the hospital-internal and regional care structures regarding personnel and institutional aspects than the previous ward. The actions of \"child euthanasia\" were based on a combination of hierarchical decision-making structures, limited responsibility, and scientific justification. The people performing these activities were provided action options withdrawal possibilities. For the affected parents the events were shifted into a psychological grey area which did not force decisions in principle. The internal conditions of the \"childrens' special wards\", the procedures and the \"treatments\" of the children were clearly regulated; the \"euthanasia\" activities themselves can be comprehended only in fragments from testimonies.

Several measures had been discussed theoretically before, but the National Socialists put the theoretical proposals into practice. As a result children and adolescents were separated, sterilized or killed. In concentration camps so-called \"depraved\" minors were selected to get special education. The object of this effort was to adapt minors to the ideology of national socialism. After passing the law to sterilize patients with \"hereditary diseases\" in 1933 about 375.000 people were sterilized unvoluntarily. In 1939 sterilizations came to an end except for adolescents at \"high risk of reproduction\". During the second world war more than 160.000 adult psychiatric patients were murdered. In addition to that, also a large number of disabled and mentally retarded minors were killed. This campaign was called child \"euthanasia\". Physicians tried to determine children's \"value of life\" by economic criteria. Children with negative ratings (i.e. inability to work or insufficient mental maturing) were killed by fasting \"cures\" or by barbiturates. Beyond that children were also used as research subjects. Their death was an accepted consequence. Physicians were also very interested in brain research. Finally, the relation to German child and adolescent psychiatry will be analysed. In the special political and social context of the Third Reich the German child and adolescent psychiatry became more significant. As a result of this the German association of child and adolescent psychiatry and allied professions was founded 1940 in Vienna. On this conference, some speakers suggested to persecute \"asocial\" minors. This suggestion was realized consequently.

The present study investigated whether increased dopamine activity in these forebrain regions is a normal consequence of reproductive experience in rodents. Both intact and ovariectomized parous and nulliparous females were tested for their responses to the dopamine agonist apomorphine using two behavioral measures, prepulse inhibition (PPI) and oral stereotypy. In addition, dopamine and DOPAC levels were measured in tissue from the striatum and nucleus accumbens together with circulating plasma prolactin levels. The results of the behavioral studies demonstrate an increased response to apomorphine in parous females. Parous subjects also had increased levels of dopamine and DOPAC in striatal tissue and lower levels of circulating prolactin. Ovariectomy in nulliparous females resulted in a potentiated response to apomorphine with regard to the disruption of PPI, as well as a significant decrease in the plasma prolactin levels, as compared with intact nulliparous females. These data suggest that increased dopamine activity in forebrain regions occurs as a consequence of parity, which persists for a minimum of several weeks postpartum. These findings support the hypothesis that increased dopamine sensitivity in forebrain dopamine regions may be one potential mechanism underlying the development of postpartum psychosis in women."}, {"Title": "[Features of autism, autistic traits, autism: retrospective analysis of clinical symptoms in children treated in the Pediatric Psychiatric Clinic].", "Abstract": "All currently accepted definitions of autism include three main criteria which have to be met for a diagnosis to be made.

The most frequent personality disorders diagnosed were obsessive-compulsive (25.5%), avoidant (21.8%), and paranoid (12.7%) personality disorders. In-patient treatment, terminating treatment against advice and tics in childhood or adolescence significantly correlated with more severe OC symptoms in adulthood."}, {"Title": "Domestic violence: level of training, knowledge base and practice among Milwaukee physicians.", "Abstract": "Domestic violence is a prevalent problem with significant health consequences. Early recognition and appropriate intervention with referral to local domestic violence agencies can be life-saving. Little is known, however, about the current level of training, knowledge base and attitudes of physicians in this area.\nA survey was sent to 1300 physicians practicing in Milwaukee County in the following specialties: Family Practice, Internal Medicine, OB/GYN, Psychiatry. Demographic information was obtained. Questions were designed to explore attitudes towards domestic violence, frequency of encounters with victims or abusers, and knowledge of resources and appropriate intervention.\nOf the 192 respondents, 74% reported having some training in domestic violence. Thirty percent reported seeing victims in their practice on a daily or weekly basis. Seventy percent feel able to identify a victim of domestic violence. Less than a third of respondents screened at least half of the patients they see for the possibility of abuse. Less than half always refer victims to a hotline or shelter, and less than a quarter of the respondents discuss safety plans with victims. A potentially dangerous response is telling a victim not to go back to an abuser without providing referrals and safety supports. In spite of this, almost a quarter of respondents always tell a victim to not go back to the abuser. Family practitioners and psychiatrists were more likely to discuss abuse with patients than were internists.\nSignificant numbers of physicians, in Milwaukee County, practicing certain specialties that potentially have a high rate of contact with domestic violence victims have had insufficient training in domestic violence assessment and intervention. Physicians should be familiar with the domestic violence hotlines and shelters in their communities and need to incorporate screen questions for domestic violence into their regular practice."}, {"Title": "Teaching in a new key: effects of a co-taught seminar on medical students' attitudes toward schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "In order to examine the effect of a consumer and professional co-taught seminar on recovery in persons with schizophrenia, fourth year medical students completed attitudinal surveys at the beginning and end of their 7-week rotation in psychiatry. Analysis of results comparing average change in scores in a group exposed to the seminar (n = 24) and a control group not exposed (n = 10), shows measurable change in some survey items indicative of attitudinal change. Such a teaching format may provide a broader perspective on the long term issues for persons with schizophrenia. This can serve to counter the limitations of the brief exposure students receive to hospitalized patients in the most debilitating phase of the illness. The co-teaching model may provide a new and balanced perspective for medical students, facilitating a more holistic understanding of patients and countering a possible overemphasis on diagnosis. Such a format could have application in teaching psychiatric residents, nurses, and other health professionals."}, {"Title": "Financial management challenges for general hospital psychiatry 2001.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry programs are facing significant business and financial challenges. This paper provides an overview of these management challenges in five areas: departmental, hospital, payment system, general finance, and policy. Psychiatric leaders will require skills in a variety of business management areas to ensure their program success. Many programs will need to develop new compensation models with more of an emphasis on revenue collection and overhead management. Programs which cannot master these areas are likely to go out of business. For academic programs, incentive systems must address not only clinical productivity, but academic and teaching output as well. General hospital programs will need to develop increased sophistication in differential cost accounting in order to be able to advocate for their patients and program in the current management climate. Clinical leaders will need the skills (ranging from actuarial to negotiations) to be at the table with contract development, since those decisions are inseparable from clinical care issues. Strategic planning needs to consider the value of improving integration with primary care, along with the ability to understand the advantages and disadvantages of risk-sharing models. Psychiatry leaders need to define and develop useful reports shared with clinical division leadership to track progress and identify problems and opportunities. Leaders should be responsible for a strategy for developing appropriate information system architecture and infrastructure. Finally, it is hoped that some leaders will emerge who can further our needs to address inequities in mental health fee schedules and parity issues which affect our program viability."}, {"Title": "Relapse prevention in schizophrenia: attitudes of neurologists-psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "The overall high relapse rates observed in schizophrenia are attributed to several causes. One important factor influencing satisfactory prevention of relapse is the lack of consistent treatment strategies among medical doctors, especially neurologists-psychiatrists. Nearly one-third of the members of the Hellenic Society of Neurology and Psychiatry were asked to fill in anonymously a structured questionnaire on their treatment attitudes and prescribing tactics regarding schizophrenic patients both after the first schizophrenic episode and after multiple episodes. The majority of Greek neurologists-psychiatrists seem to adopt prescribing habits that approximate the current international standards for prevention of schizophrenic relapse. Their attitudes regarding the treatment and prevention of relapse for the first schizophrenic episode and first relapse are determined from multiple factors. These are: the expected relapse rates after the first episode, the expected prevalence of extrapyramidal side effects following a long-term neuroleptic treatment, the patient's expected treatment compliance after the first episode, the doctor's experience with treating schizophrenics, and lastly the knowledge of current literature on the topic. These results point to the need for continuing education, especially of the younger mental health professionals and those working in the private sector, addressing the issue of the actual risk of developing side effects from the treatment. In due course, benefits could result for everyday psychiatric practice and the patients' compliance with treatment."}, {"Title": "In vivo steady-state pharmacokinetic outcome following clinical and toxic doses of racemic citalopram to rats.", "Abstract": "The thymoleptic drug citalopram (CIT) belongs to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and is today extensively used in psychiatry. Further clarification of the enantiomer-selective distribution of racemic CIT in both clinical and toxic doses is highly warranted. By a steady-state in vivo paradigm, rats underwent chronic systemic exposure for 10 days by using osmotic pumps and the total as well as the individual distributions of the S- and R-enantiomers of CIT, and its metabolites in serum and two different brain regions, were analysed. In serum, the S/R ratios in the groups treated with 10, 20, or 100 mg kg(-1) day(-1) were 0.94, 0.83, and 0.34, respectively. The ratios were almost the same in the brain regions. In the group treated with 100 mg kg(-1) day(-1), the serum and brain total CIT levels were found to be 20 times and 6 - 8 times higher than in the rats treated with 10 or 20 mg kg(-1) day(-1), respectively. In all groups, the CIT levels were higher in brain tissue as compared to serum. In a spontaneous open-field behavioural test, a correlation between clinical and toxic drug concentrations was observed. In conclusion, the R-enantiomer was present in an increased proportion compared with the S-enantiomer when higher steady-state CIT concentration was prevailing. This is of particular interest, since the S-enantiomer is responsible for the inhibition of serotonin reuptake in vitro. The present data may be of importance, as full understanding on where different racemic or enantiomeric drug effects of CIT and its main metabolites are unravelled."}, {"Title": "Predicting admission rates to secure forensic psychiatry services.", "Abstract": "The planning and development of secure forensic psychiatry services for mentally disordered offenders in England and Wales has proceeded independently within different regional areas. However, certain mental disorders, offenders, and offending behaviour are all more prevalent in geographical areas characterized by socio-economic deprivation and social disorganization. Failure to consider these factors has led to inadequate service provision in some areas and inequity in funding. A new model is required to predict admissions to these services as an aid to resource allocation.\nActual admissions (N = 3155) to high and medium secure psychiatric services for seven of 14 (pre-reorganization) Regional Health Authorities, 1988-94. Expected admissions were calculated for each district using 1991 census data adjusted for under-enumeration. Standardized psychiatric admission ratios were calculated and a range of social, health status, and service provision data were used as explanatory variables in a regression analysis to determine variation between districts.\nActual psychiatric admissions varied from 160% above to 62% below expected for age, sex, and marital status, according to patients' catchment area of origin, measured according to deciles of the distribution of underprivileged area scores at ward level. The most powerful explanatory variables included a composite measure of social deprivation, ethnicity and availability of low secure beds at regional level.\nAdmission rates to secure forensic psychiatry services demonstrate a linear correlation with measures of socio-economic deprivation in patients catchment area of origin. A model was developed to predict admissions from District Health Authorities and is recommended for future use in resource allocation. Identification of factors that explain higher admission rates of serious offenders with mental disorder from deprived areas is a priority for future research."}, {"Title": "[How do geriatric psychiatry patients evaluate their stay in a specialized psychiatric department of a general hospital?].", "Abstract": "Following mainly the patients' view, the study examines whether the treatment of gerontopsychiatric patients in common with younger patients in a general psychiatric ward might entail disadvantages.\nOut of a total of 297 gerontopsychiatric patients treated in 1999, a group of 107 patients was asked via a self-constructed questionnaire about different aspects of common treatment with younger patients.\nWith the exception of an underrepresentation of organic disorders, the 107 interviewed patients did not differ substantially in basic characteristics from the entire group of gerontopsychiatric patients treated in 1999. Life together with younger patients was judged predominantly positively. The older patients themselves rejected the often stated complaint that nurses would neglect the gerontopsychiatric patients on age-mixed wards.\nNeither objective facts nor the subjective judgement by the users point to assume that common treatment of gerontopsychiatric patients together with younger patients could be disadvantageous.

Before, he had been repeatedly rejected when he sought treatment in state-run psychiatric facilities and was expelled several times from long-term hospitals despite a long history of violent behaviour when untreated. \"Kendra's Law\" now entitles physicians, case workers, roommates and families of untreated mentally ill persons to seek a court order forcing a patient to comply with treatment and, at the same time, compelling mental health institutions to grant this treatment. Additionally, the law and another bill signed in November 1999 provided for additional funding for the underfinanced state-run mental health system.\n\"Kendra's Law\" illustrates a bidirectional attempt to cope with the revolving door treatment situation of mentally ill in the State of New York by additional funding and additional possibilities to enforce treatment.

The phenomenology, the forms and themes of delusion, the delusional certainty, the impact on behaviour (\"Realit\u00e4tsbedeutung\"), the levels of development of delusional perception and the meaning of the psychological working-up of the primordial delusional experiences (\"Wahnarbeit\") are described. The structure-dynamic and the 'gestalt'-psychological approaches of Janzarik and Kisker try to derive the phenomenon of delusional psychoses from the psychonomy of the emotional connections, as far as they cannot be explained as immediate symptoms of a somatic illness. [7]. The present study also shows that subjective experiences of schizophrenic patients, suffering from delusions, largely develop psychonomically according to the rules of the psychic motivational dynamic, and that the share of the comprehensible working-up and assimilation with regard to the \"schizophrenic end-phenomena\" [16] has been considered too little by the traditional psychiatry. But, there are in the view of the basic symptom concept, especially in process active stages, hints at a higher share of the somatic component as to the structure of delusional syndromes. Looking at the processes, determined by the psychic causality on the one side, and at the boundaries of \"genetic understanding\" [39] in the delusional psychosis on the other side, we tried to answer the question to what extent the delusional psychosis can be understood according to the \"principle of psychonomy\" [5,6], and, in what respect it seems to be \"apsychonomic\" and thereby presumably somatically founded. The inquiry yields starting points for a biological hypothesis of delusion, compatible with a multidimensional conception, that reveals understandable connections between delusion and biography and shows the reach of the \"principle of psychonomy\"."}, {"Title": "Might within the madness: solution-focused therapy and thought-disordered clients.", "Abstract": "Nurses working with thought-disordered clients in inpatient psychiatric settings may find that much of their role is defined by the administration and monitoring of antipsychotic medications.

In response to this challenge, this article presents the use of solution-focused therapy (SFT) to help thought-disordered clients better cope with some of their negative experiences and symptomatology. The article provides an overview of SFT, with a focus on how these techniques might be used on an inpatient psychiatry setting with clients experiencing thought disorders.

Programmes varied from behavioural to cognitive interventions to help carers adjust to particular problem behaviours in their injured relatives. All programmes were professionally led. Most of the data presented was on primary caregivers related to the head-injured person. Only one study used standard assessment tools. The remainder used a variety of methods including self-report measures and interviews. All interventions were reported as beneficial to carers. Overall these studies were found to be limited by biased sampling, nonstandardized outcome measures using subjective methodologies and a lack of control samples.

Improved understanding in this area may therefore benefit patient care. Meaning of illness has not previously been explored in renal disease.\nCross-sectional survey (n=405) in a single regional renal unit in the North of England. Ethical approval was obtained and patients gave written consent. The instrument used was an eight-item schema, based on the work of Lipowski (1970, Psychiatry in Medicine 1, 91-102). Field notes regarding rationale for choice were recorded concurrently, then content analysed to enable identification of themes.

Slightly more older than younger patients selected 'challenge', although the difference was not statistically significant and older patients more commonly had a fatalistic interpretation of the option. More men selected 'challenge' than women. Those selecting 'challenge' and 'value' appeared to have a more positive outlook than other patients.\nPatients had identifiable meanings for their illness, and these may be associated with their response to renal disease.

Measures of social skills frequently rely on self-report, and most measures which directly assess social functioning are time consuming.

Ratings in eight areas ranging from 'social appropriateness' to 'grooming' were made.\nSSPA required about 12 min to complete both role play and ratings, and had excellent interrater reliability, and good test-retest reliability. Patients demonstrated significantly greater disability in all areas of social functioning compared with NCs. Social performance was related to severity of negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, but not that of positive or depressive symptoms. SSPA scores were significantly correlated with health-related quality of well-being and observed performance on activities of daily living, but not to a self-reported measure of social functioning.\nThe SSPA is a reliable and useful instrument.

Reflections on 3 taboos in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Few studies have assessed the links of violence, desire and death with psychiatry in a scientific way. Doctors are nonetheless regularly confronted with these situations which are particularly difficult to manage. It is not evident that psychiatrists are properly prepared to deal with them. This paper proposes an original analysis of the scientific literature related to violence, desire and death, and compares the attitudes of European and American doctors.\n1) Violence: there is definitely a relationship between violence and mental disorder. Psychiatrists are particularly at risk of being assaulted by patients, especially at the beginning of their carrier (almost 50%). Violence also includes verbal and non-verbal threats, particularly in the emergency department. Psychiatrists are poorly trained to deal with this. 2) Desire: desire is widespread in psychiatry, and can lead to sexual contact between the patient and the therapist in 7 to 10% of cases. The outpatient setting carries the greater risk. Professional associations unanimously disapprove of such conduct but the ethics of posttermination sexual contact remains controversial. Sexual harassment of female doctors by patients is another form of desire (and of violence). Psychiatrists are also poorly trained to deal with desire. 3) Death: acute death occurs in psychiatry (e.g., suicide, substance intoxication and withdrawal, delirium, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, anorexia nervosa, dementia, lethal catatonia), and there is also a link between mental disorder and a higher incidence of natural mortality. Psychiatrists may thus be confronted with death, and the inpatient setting carries the greater risk. They are nonetheless poorly trained in thanatology.\nPsychiatric residents need better training to manage violence, desire and death. Poor training results in their exposure to dangerous situations and in inappropriate reactions. Acute management and primary prevention are needed. Acute management should include a collegiate approach, in order to avoid being the \"target\" of the patient or his/her family. Primary prevention comes through the breaking of the taboos which are still too frequent in Europe, even though the situation is different from the USA. It is important to lay down limits between psychiatry and violence, desire and death. Those situations should before all be better understood, and thereby research in this field have to be stimulated. The holding of consensus conferences in Europe is also important.\nThere is an intimate relationship between violence, desire, death and psychiatry. This relation is too often neglected, as the poor training of psychiatrists underlines. The nature of the patient-doctor relationship have to be redefined according to those considerations."}, {"Title": "The last mental hospital.", "Abstract": "The public mental hospital system was created in part because many mentally ill people were being held in prisons and jails. Support for those hospitals waned over time, however, and by the time they had degenerated into \"snake pits\" a consensus was reached to close them down. Unfortunately, they were not replaced with adequate community mental health resources, so as the hospitals have emptied, the prisons and jails have filled, partly with the mentally ill. That is the destructive reason for the growth of prison psychiatry in this country: the prison has become the last mental hospital. The constructive one has been a new emphasis on bringing psychiatric treatment to a previously neglected population: people who have committed serious violence, whether because of Axis I mental illnesses or Axis II character disorders. Unfortunately, four inter-related, mutually reinforcing nationwide trends threaten to reinforce that destructive development and vitiate the constructive one."}, {"Title": "Pharmacokinetic interaction between imipramine and carbamazepine in patients with major depression.", "Abstract": "Despite the fact that carbamazepine (CBZ) is frequently added to the existing tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) therapy, to date little is known about serum levels of pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites of TCAs, as well as about possible changes in free (non-protein-bound) concentrations of these drugs and their metabolites during such combination treatment of depression.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CBZ on steady-state total and free serum concentrations of imipramine (IMI) and its metabolites, desipramine (DMI), 2-hydroxyimipramine and 2-hydroxydesipramnine, in depressed patients. In addition, the free and total serum concentrations of CBZ and 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine were measured.\nThirteen patients with DSM-III-R diagnosis of major depression were enrolled in the study. All patients hospitalised at the Department of Psychiatry, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University were treated with IMI at a dose of 2 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks, after which CBZ at a dose of 400 mg/day was added. Steady-state serum concentrations of IMI, CBZ and their metabolites were assayed by HPLC. Free drug concentrations were measured by ultrafiltration.\nAfter 2 weeks of combination therapy a significant decrease in mean steady-state total serum concentrations of IMI (from 168.84 +/- 102.18 to 98.12 +/- 43.79 ng/ml) and DMI (from 293.89 +/- 171.93 to 221.85 +/- 153.21 ng/ml) was observed. Simultaneously, steady-state serum concentrations of total hydroxy metabolites and free IMI and its metabolites, measured just before and 2 weeks after CBZ were started, did not differ significantly. In consequence, a significant increase in free fraction of the parent drug was observed (3.36 +/- 3.24% vs 5.75 +/- 3.60%). Also free fraction of DMI tended to be higher after CBZ addition.\nCBZ affects not only the metabolism of IMI and its metabolites, but also their protein binding.

Binswanger also interpreted Heidegger's concept of the existing individual (Dasein) as Being-in-the-World, in the sense of seeking out the existential structure of individuals' lives.

The patient's state of physical and mental health will determine both the type of therapeutic work possible and the focus of such work. Tailoring the therapeutic intervention to the patient's specific needs and flexibility in altering and adapting therapeutic strategies over time in line with the patient's changing needs are essential. Although periods of treatment may range from single session to long term, supportive, insight oriented, group, family, cognitive and behavioral techniques have all been used successfully in a C-L setting, with measurable impact on well-being. Psychotherapeutic work in C-L is unique in that the focus of the therapist extends beyond the patient and family to include all caregivers, including other health care professionals, in line with the biopsychosocial model."}, {"Title": "Health gain and outcome predictors during inpatient and related day treatment in child and adolescent psychiatry.", "Abstract": "To investigate health gain and its predictors during inpatient and associated day patient treatment.\nConsecutive admissions to two inpatient units for children and young adolescents in northwest England were studied (N = 55). Ascertainments were made from multiple perspectives, including family, teacher, clinician, and an independent researcher. Measures were taken at referral, admission, discharge, and 6-month follow-up; health gain was inferred from change scores on measures. Recruitment lasted from late 1995 to 1997; follow-up was completed during 1998. Independent variables tested as predictors included assessments of presenting symptoms, therapeutic alliance, and family functioning.\nSignificant health gain during hospitalization was found on most measures and sustained to follow-up. There was no symptom change during the waiting-list control condition. Health gain was predicted independently by child and parental therapeutic alliance with the unit early in hospitalization and by preadmission family functioning. Externalizing problems did well if accompanied by good alliance.\nAssessment of health gain from multiple perspectives is possible and valuable. Inpatient treatment has significant therapeutic effect. Predictors for health gain lie in process variables of therapeutic alliance and family functioning rather than presenting symptoms.

The number of individuals from this ethnic group being treated in Japanese mental hospitals has increased. We hypothesized that Japanese-Brazilian patients with panic disorders adjusted better to Japanese society and culture than those with other mental disorders. The subjects in the present study are 40 Japanese-Brazilian patients undergoing treatment at the Department of Psychiatry at Jichi Medical School, Japan, from May 1990 to September 1998. Patients were divided into a panic disorder group, a schizophrenic group, a mood disorder group and a neurosis group. Demographic data (Japanese language ability, duration of residence in Japan etc.) were collected. A comparison was made among the four groups. Patients in the panic disorder group showed a significant tendency to be fluent speakers of Japanese. Patients in the panic disorder group also had been in Japan for a significantly longer period of time than those in the other three groups. Japanese ability and length of residence in Japan rule out exacerbating factors due to a foreign living environment. Panic disorder patients usually have resolved the problems inherent in living and working in a foreign country. In general, Japanese-Brazilians are more comfortable both financially and socially in Japan than other foreign laborers because of their cultural and family background. The emotional conflict experienced by such patients may result from concern over whether to live in Brazil or Japan in the future. Their ethnic and cultural identity may be confused, fluctuating between identifying with Brazil and with Japan, and this may cause vague feelings of anxiety."}, {"Title": "The humble case report.", "Abstract": "There is negligible systematic information about case reports in the psychiatric literature. We aimed to describe case report articles published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry (ANZJP), to provide data about the quality of evidence they offer, to ascertain changes over time and to make recommendations, based on our findings, about these articles.\nAll articles describing cases which appeared in the ANZJP between 1967 and 1999 were identified and examined.\n256 articles describing a total of 479 cases were published over the study period. Fifty-five per cent of articles reported an unusual presentation. Thirty-eight per cent of cases had a mood disorder and 24% had a psychosis. Seventy-six per cent of patients had a positive outcome. Cases published in 1989-1999 were more likely to describe pharmacological treatments than cases published earlier.\nClinical descriptions that lead to progress are undervalued. Case reports should retain a place in the ANZJP, provided they convey information that is new and useful (e.g. suggesting or refuting hypotheses) rather than simply document current practice or describe the unusual.

Interviewers used the Composite International Diagnostic Interview - Automated to establish DSM-IV diagnoses, and the Personality Disorders Questionnaire to identify personality disorder. All prisons in New Zealand were visited.\nThe results indicate markedly elevated prevalence rates for major mental disorder in the prison population when compared with community samples. This is especially the case for substance misuse, psychotic disorders, major depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive- compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Of particular concern is not only the increased prevalence rates for schizophrenia and related disorders but also the high level of comorbidity with substance misuse disorders demonstrated by this group. While 80.8% of inmates diagnosed with bipolar disorder were receiving psychiatric treatment in the prison, only 46.4% of depressed inmates and 37% of those suffering from psychosis were receiving treatment. Maori inmates were grossly overrepresented in the remand, female and male sentenced inmate population compared with the general population.\nA significant increase in provision of mental health services is required to cope with the high number of mentally ill inmates. The level of need demonstrated by this study requires a level of service provision that is quite beyond the capacity of current forensic psychiatry services, Department of Corrections Psychological Services or the prison nursing and medical officers. The elevated rates of common mental disorders argues for the use of improved psychiatric screening instruments, improved assessment and treatment capacities in the prison and an increased number of forensic psychiatric inpatient facilities to care for those psychotic inmates who are too unwell to be treated in the prison."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry has much to offer for chronic pain.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to make an argument in favour of the inclusion of psychiatrists on chronic pain clinic teams.\nThe argument takes the form of answers to four central questions: (i) does pain involve an emotional experience; (ii) do psychiatric disorders accompany chronic pain; (iii) can psychiatric disorders present as chronic pain; and (iv) which patients present to pain units, and what do we know of their personalities?\nThe affirmative case was substantiated in respect of the first three questions. In examining the last question, evidence indicates that patients who present to chronic pain units frequently have personality features that make assessment and therapy difficult.\nPsychiatry is the field of medicine where practitioners have the most experience with emotional states and personality, and is the only field where they have specialized skills in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders.

The articles were examined to determine whether response biases were mentioned and whether systematic efforts were made to attend to their influence on the findings of the study. Each article was assessed twice by independent raters. The examination indicates that a very small minority of the articles reviewed mentioned response bias and that among those mentioning it, a minority attempted to control for bias effects.

Improvements in CAMHS are described from a Victorian perspective, including the model of specialist clinical programmes or teams for specific patient populations. Mechanisms are outlined for AMHS to better assist young adults from 18 to 25 years of age.\nThe model of clinical projects or clinical programme teams, developed in partnership with primary health and others, is a suitable vehicle to help AMHS to improve clinical services to their young adult populations.

Difficulties around authorship, sensitive use of language, conflict of interest and bias in the publishing process are additional issues claiming our attention.\nA clearly articulated publishing ethos is desirable. Potential strategies to achieve this include devising guidelines on publishing ethics, teaching the subject to new writers, journals committing themselves to the ethical dimension of their operations, and penalising colleagues who violate agreed principles of good conduct."}, {"Title": "The role of economic evaluation in mental health care.", "Abstract": "A consequence of the integration of psychiatry into acute and public health medicine is that psychiatrists are being asked to evaluate their services. There is pressure on mental health-care systems because it is recognized that funds should be directed where they can provide the best health outcomes, and also because there are resource constraints which limit our capacity to meet all demands for health care. This pressure can be responded to by evaluation which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of psychiatric treatment. This paper seeks to remind psychiatrists of the fundamental principles of economic evaluation in the hope that these will enable psychiatrists to understand the methods used in evaluation and to work comfortably with evaluators.\nThe paper reviews the basic principles behind economic evaluation, illustrating these with reference to case studies. It describes: (i) the cost of the burden of illness and treatment, and how these costs are measured; (ii) the measurement of treatment outcomes, both as changes in health status and as resources saved; and (iii) the various types of economic evaluation, including cost-minimization, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and cost-benefit analysis.\nThe advice in the paper provides psychiatrists with the necessary background to work closely with evaluators.

Women accounted for three-quarters of the sample, and men for one-quarter. The average age was 72 years. The fact that only 16% of the patients had been transferred from psychiatric hospitals and that more than half had been referred directly by their local doctors underlines the acute-psychiatric nature of the institution. More than 80% of the patients were discharged to their previous place of residence. A highly significant improvement in affective state was verified by the Hamilton Depression Scale. Significant improvements were also registered in the following items: general satisfaction with life, state of health, physical and mental performance, and scope for personal development.

Depot parenteral administration of haloperidol decanoate was utilized to achieve consistent high levels in rat brain for 9 months with 2-month withdrawal or 11 months with 48-h withdrawal and compared to vehicle control and acute haloperidol (48-h) treatment groups. Autoradiographic means for measuring levels of D2 ([(3)H]-spiperone) and D3 receptors ([(125)I]trans 7-OH-PIPAT) and of D3 mRNA by in situ hybridization histochemistry in rat caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, islands of Calleja, and olfactory tubercle determined that there were significant group differences for regulation of D2 receptor. Chronic haloperidol for 9 or 11 months elevated D2 but not D3 receptors or D3 mRNA in all regions measured. Acute haloperidol treatment had no significant effects for any measure. Treatment for 9 months with a 2-month withdrawal resulted in a persistent increase in D2 receptors that was greater than that observed in the 11 months with 48-h withdrawal. This effect was most noticeable in the olfactory tubercle. These data confirm previous findings that short- or long-term haloperidol treatment leads to elevations in D2 but not D3 receptors or D3 mRNA, and long-term withdrawal from chronic haloperidol does not lead to elevations in D3 receptors or D3 mRNA. This suggests that an elevation in D3 receptors identified at postmortem in schizophrenics withdrawn from antipsychotics is not the result of the previous drug history [Gurevich et al.

Using a recently developed semi-structured interview (Diagnostic Evaluation Schedule for Children and Adolescents - Hungarian version, DESCA-H ), 68 life events of a total sample of 526 children were investigated. Two hundred and fifteen depressed preadolescents (mean age 12.73 years, SD 2.58) were compared with identical variables of 311 nondepressed mixed clinical controls (mean age: 10.91 years, SD 2.46) referred to child psychiatry care with other psychiatric symptomatology than depression. The life event questionnaire part of the DESCA-H was administered separately by means of lists of recent (within 1 year) and past stresses (events prior to 1 year before the assessment). With the two series of life stresses, two separate logistic regression analyses were performed. Of past stressors, physical punishment of the child by teachers, serious financial problems of the family and mental health problems of family members were found to be significant predictors of depression. From the series of recent stresses, moving to a new school, somatic illness, death of relatives and mental health disorders of family members were proved to be independent risk factors of depression for the children. The findings suggest that significant stresses of the child shared with other family members dominate in demarcating depressed children from nondepressed ones.

This study explored the association between lifetime medication use by parents and their children. Two hundred and twenty-one young patients (158 boys and 63 girls) consulting at a child and adolescent psychiatry department, six to 16 years of age (mean = 9.7 years), were screened for lifetime use of psychotropic drugs using a structured interview. Parents were asked about their own consumption, as well as their children's. Lifetime consumption rates (at least once) were 22.2% in boys and 20.6% in girls, and 19.6% in children less than 11 years old. Higher rates were found in patients with emotional disorders (anxiety disorders and depression). In parents, 45.1% of mothers and 24.1% of fathers reported using medications at least once. A significant association was found between child and parental medication use: 34.1% of children had positive lifetime consumption when their mothers also used medications at least once versus only 13.6% in other children (odds ratio = 3.31 [1.68-6.50]; P = 0.001). The most significant association was found between medication use by girls and their mothers (odds ratio = 12.1 [2.38-61.5]; P = 0.003).

In animal infections, BDV can persist in the CNS and induce alterations in brain cell functions, neurodevelopmental abnormalities and behavioral disturbances.

In this study, we investigated TPH and suicide completion, the most severe form of suicidal behavior. A relatively large sample of suicide completers (n = 101) was genotyped at three TPH loci (two polymorphisms in the promoter region, A-6526G and G-5806T, and one in intron 7, A218C) and compared to psychiatrically normal living controls (n = 129). Although no significant differences were found between groups for genetic variation at single loci, haplotype analysis revealed that one haplotype (-6526G -5806T 218C) was significantly more frequent among suicide cases than in normal controls (chi(2) = 11.30, df = 2, P = 0.0008; OR = 2.0 CI: 1.30-3.6). Further analyses suggested that this haplotype is particularly more frequent among subjects who committed suicide using violent methods. Similar results were observed in recent haplotype analyses in suicide attempters, which found that the equivalent of haplotype -6526G -5806T 218C was more frequent in impulsive attempters (Rotondo et al, Mol Psychiatry 1999; 4: 360-368). Our results replicate in suicide completers previous data observed in suicide attempters. These and other results continue to point to the substantial role that the gene that codes for TPH may play in the neurobiology of suicidal behavior."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of the multiaxial system of ICD-10 (preliminary praft): correlations between multiaxial assessment and clinical judgements of aetiology, treatment indication and prognosis.", "Abstract": "Forty-five raters in 7 German centres took part in a multicentric field trial of the multiaxial system of ICD-10, delivering a total of 488 multiaxial assessments of 12 written case summaries. In addition to the multi-axial ratings (including main and subsidiary psychiatry diagnoses, level of social dysfunctioning and psychosocial stressors), assessments were made by the raters of the aetiology, treatment indications and prognosis of the main psychiatric disorder. There were significant correlations between these judgements and the measures of the multiaxial ratings: 62% of the cases diagnosed as endogenous were assessed as having a high level of social dysfunctioning (the proportion for all cases being 50.4%) and 63.4% as having a low number of stressors (vs. 52.8% in all cases). In contrast, cases diagnosed as reactive were assessed as having a lower level of social dysfunctioning and more social stressors. Cases whose prognosis was poor showed a higher rate of comorbidity and a high level of social dysfunctioning. The results demonstrate that the multiaxial approach reflects factors important to the process of clinical treatment and decision making and delivers preliminary evidence of this system's treatment and prognostic validity."}, {"Title": "[Infant and child psychiatry in Denmark].", "Abstract": "A descriptive epidemiological study of children aged 0-36 months.\nDiagnoses reported from the child psychiatric departments to The National Psychiatric Register were collected from a three-year period 1996, 1997, and 1998. The child psychiatric departments in Denmark filled in a questionnaire concerning referral, assessment, treatment, and consultant/liason functions. All the child psychiatric departments took part in the study.\n529 children aged 0-3 years were reported to the National Psychiatric Register. In the period studied, there was a 30% increase in the number of children reported. Adjustment reactions were the commonest diagnosis in the youngest children, aged 0-12 months. Pervasive developmental disorders, particularly infantile autism, were commonest used in the age group 2-3 years. Twenty-four per cent of the children reported, especially the youngest children, had no specific psychiatric diagnosis. The increase in the number of children aged 0-1 year with adjustment reactions and non-specific diagnoses is discussed. Children aged 0-3 years are mainly treated as outpatients or by a consultant/liason child psychiatric service. The children referred to the child psychiatric departments in 1997 varied from fewer than 10 to about 100 children. Infant psychiatric units were established in two places in Denmark, in 1992 and 1997.\nThe increasing number of children aged 0-3 years reported to the National Psychiatric Register in the period 1996-1998 reflects an increase in the children aged 2-3 years diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorders, and in the case of the youngest children, aged 0-1 year, a more extensive child psychiatric intervention in relation to populations at risk, such as infants with mentally ill mothers."}, {"Title": "[Infant psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Infant psychiatry is a discipline concerned with diagnostic assessment, treatment, and prevention of mental health problems in infancy and early childhood.

Cox regression indicates that the incidence of discharge and hence LOS is modulated by a number of illness-related and other factors, and their relationship is explored.\nWhile a linear model is commonly assumed, LOS in psychiatry is governed by a hazard-based process. As a tool in quality management, LOS data for psychiatric hospitals might be routinely analyzed and the effects of non-illness-related factors minimized."}, {"Title": "Why do some cancer patients with depression desire an early death and others do not?", "Abstract": "Major depression is a well-documented risk factor for suicide in cancer patients as well as in the general population.

The authors investigated the background differences among cancer patients suffering from major depression with and without suicidal ideation by analyzing the consultation data of patients referred to the psychiatry division. Among the 1,721 referred patients, 220 (12.8%) were diagnosed with major depression, and of these 113 (51.4%) had suicidal ideation. Logistic regression analysis indicated that poor physical functioning and severe depression were significant risk factors.

The aim of this study is to analyze whether the U.S. factor structure of the Conners Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) can be replicated in a German clinical sample.\nA German child psychiatry sample of 1394 children children and adolescents was randomly splitted into halves. One sub-sample was used to calculate a German factor model by means of exploratory factor analysis. This model is tested in comparison with he U.S. model constructed according to Conners (1989) in the second sub-sample by means of a confirmatory factor analysis (LISREL 8).\n87% of the path relations in the German and U.S.-American models are identical. Both models show limitations with regard to their predictive power. As expected, the goodness of fit indices for the German model are somewhat better than for the U.S. model (GFI = .81; AGFI = .75 versus GFI = .76; AGFI = .71).\nThe goodness of fit indices of the CPRS model are less satisfactory than those of other studies on the cross-cultural generalizability of factor structures of dimensional questionnaires (i.e., De Groot et al., 1994). However, this is mainly due to restrictions within the model (no multiple factor loadings). With respect to the cross-cultural generalizability differences were found in the impulsiveness/hyperactivity scale.

Analyses were done over 560 treatment places used by 69% male and 31% female patients mean ages 10 years and 2 months. Mean treatment duration is 104 days without differences with respect to the primary psychotherapeutic orientation (behavioral, psychodynamic, family therapy, other). Personnel is in 80.5% of the DTC below the governmental guidelines. Rates per day vary between 280 DM and 617 DM with a mean of 389 DM. Mean treatment costs per patient are 36.303 DM (min.: 12.825 DM; max.: 89.793 DM). Rates per day and duration of treatment are negatively correlated: The higher the rate per day, the shorter the treatment (explained variance: 17%). This correlation can only be explained indirectly by more personnel as associated with higher daily rates. However, more influential is the amount of time the children are present in day treatment per week: The longer the children are present, the shorter the duration of the whole treatment.

Female psychiatrists were underrepresented in the disciplined group. Psychiatrists were significantly more likely than nonpsychiatrist physicians to be disciplined for sexual relationships with patients and about as likely to be charged with negligence or incompetence. The disciplined and nondisciplined psychiatrists did not differ significantly from a group of 75 nondisciplined psychiatrists on years since medical school graduation, international medical graduate status, or board certification. The disciplined group included significantly more psychiatrists who claimed child psychiatry as their first or second specialty and significantly fewer psychoanalysts.\nOrganized psychiatry has an obligation to address sexual contact with patients and other causes for medical board discipline. This obligation may be addressable through enhanced residency training, recertification exams, and other means of education."}, {"Title": "The dream in contemporary psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This article offers selective reviews of cogent sectors of research regarding the dream in contemporary psychiatry.\nFirst, the author discusses relatively recent research (1953-1999) on the neurobiology and clinical psychophysiology of dreaming sleep; second, he reviews experimental cognitive neuroscientific studies of perception, emotion, and memory and the putative interrelationships among them in generating dream imagery; and third, he interprets psychoanalytic studies (1900-1999) on related aspects of dreams and the dream process.\nExploration for interrelationships among information from these three areas entails discussion of the mind/brain problem.

We reviewed the charts of 159 patients consecutively admitted to an acute geriatric psychiatry unit over 18 months. We recorded admission diagnoses from initial treatment plans, and discharge diagnoses from discharge summaries. Mean patient age was 80 years and average length of stay was 17 days. The most common primary diagnoses were psychotic and depressive disorders. The most common secondary diagnoses were dementias and depressive disorders. Primary diagnoses changed from admission to discharge in 31 patients (20%), and secondary diagnoses changed in 76 patients (48%).

Common methods define the consultees' problems as work problems; the consultant views the consultees' difficulties as due to intrapsychic conflicts. Resolution of the consultees' difficulties requires the consultant to use methods that enhance the consultee's self-esteem and indirectly provide the consultee insight into the genesis of his or her problems. Thus, consultees are gradually better able to help the client with his or her difficulties. Training of child psychiatry residents in school consultation historically occurred in three divisions of child psychiatry. Training methods were quite similar.

The technique proved reliable, with interday and intraday variation of less than 5% and a quantification limit for reboxetine and one of its main metabolites O-desethylreboxetine (O-reboxetine) at 5 and 30 nmol/L, respectively. The method was applied on serum samples from 38 patients treated chronically with reboxetine. These samples were drawn as trough levels in steady state with a dosage range of 2-16 mg/day. They evidenced a mean reboxetine concentration that was fairly linear and dose proportional, although the variance in concentration was large between patients, even those taking the same dosage.

On the basis of each illness's distinct characteristics, five treatment principles are emphasized: 1) Treatment strategies should be long-term and should emphasize adherence, 2) treatment choice should be empirical, 3) combinations of medications may be helpful, 4) a combination of psychosocial and pharmacologic treatments may be more useful than either alone, and 5) the family or \"significant others\" as well as a consumer organization need to be involved. Some of the new directions in dinical research to refine these strategies and meet these challenges are also described."}, {"Title": "Current awareness in geriatric psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In order to keep subscribers up-to-date with the latest developments in their field, John Wiley &amp: Sons are providing a current awareness service in each issue of the journal.

The most frequent ICD-10 diagnostic category was somatoform disorder (N=30) followed by depressive disorder (N=6). The age of onset of the physical symptoms was significantly earlier in those with somatoform disorders (mean 49 years; SD 3.1 years) compared with patients with depressive disorders (mean 74 years; SD 3.1 years) (p<0.05). All diagnoses were equally associated with moderate functional impairment.\nMedically unexplained physical symptoms may occur as part of a range of psychiatric disorders in older people and diagnostic groups are distinct in a number of ways. The usefulness of the ICD-10 classification of disorders in relation to these patients is considered. Implications for the delivery of old age psychiatry services are discussed."}, {"Title": "The role of tests of frontal executive function in the detection of mild dementia.", "Abstract": "To compare the performance of patients with mild dementia (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) >23), depression (Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) >12) and controls on tests of frontal executive function (FEF), to see if simple tools could be an adjunct to early recognition of dementia in primary care.\nSubjects were required to score above 23 on the MMSE, and to be non-depressed unless in the depression group. Tests of FEF used were a letter based verbal fluency test, a cognitive estimates test, trail marking parts A and B, and a Stroop colour word test. Subjects were followed up at one year to assess long-term outcomes.\nThe Thornhill Unit, an old age psychiatry unit, Moorgreen Hospital, Southampton, UK.\nSixteen patients with a clinical diagnosis of dementia but with normal or borderline MMSE scores, 16 subjects with depression and 19 healthy control subjects.\nSubjects with mild dementia scored significantly worse than control subjects on all FEF tests used other than verbal fluency. Subjects with mild dementia were only found to score worse than depressed subjects on the cognitive estimates test and Stroop test, with the Stroop test providing better discrimination between these groups. At follow-up, MMSE scores of both dementia and depression groups were worse.\nMany simple tests of FEF can distinguish subjects with mild dementia from controls, although caution must be taken in the presence of depression. Of these tests, the cognitive estimates test may provide a simple test which can be used in conjunction with screening tests for dementia, such as the MMSE. The Stroop colour test was the most successful at distinguishing subjects with mild dementia from those with depression, but was more difficult to use. The depression group remained cognitively impaired at follow-up, despite improvements in depressive symptoms."}, {"Title": "Toxicant-induced loss of tolerance.", "Abstract": "Drug addiction and multiple chemical intolerance (abdiction) appear to be polar opposites--the former characterized by craving and dependency, the latter by aversion. However, when the two are viewed in juxtaposition similarities emerge, revealing a common underlying dynamic, one which appears to be a new paradigm of disease. TILT, or toxicant-induced loss of tolerance, bridges the gap between addiction and abduction and has the potential to explain a variety of illnesses, including certain cases of asthma, migraine headaches and depression, as well as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia and \"Gulf War syndrome\". This paper argues that both addiction and chemical intolerance involve a fundamental breakdown in innate tolerance, resulting in an amplification of various biological effects, particularly withdrawal symptoms. While addicts seek further exposures so as to avoid unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, chemically intolerant individuals shun their problem exposures, but for the same reason--to avoid unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. These observations raise critical questions: do addictive drugs and environmental pollutants initiate an identical disease process? Once this process begins, can both addictants and pollutants trigger symptoms and cravings? TILT opens a new window between the fields of addiction and environmental medicine, one that has the potential to transform neighboring realms of medicine, psychology, psychiatry and toxicology."}, {"Title": "Prospects for neurology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Neurological and psychiatric illnesses are among the most common and most serious health problems in developed societies. The most promising advances in neurological and psychiatric diseases will require advances in neuroscience for their elucidation, prevention, and treatment. Technical advances have improved methods for identifying brain regions involved during various types of cognitive activity, for tracing connections between parts of the brain, for visualizing individual neurons in living brain preparations, for recording the activities of neurons, and for studying the activity of single-ion channels and the receptors for various neurotransmitters. The most significant advances in the past 20 years have come from the application to the nervous system of molecular genetics and molecular cell biology. Discovery of the monogenic disorder responsible for Huntington disease and understanding its pathogenesis can serve as a paradigm for unraveling the much more complex, polygenic disorders responsible for such psychiatric diseases as schizophrenia, manic depressive illness, and borderline personality disorder. Thus, a new degree of cooperation between neurology and psychiatry is likely to result, especially for the treatment of patients with illnesses such as autism, mental retardation, cognitive disorders associated with Alzheimer and Parkinson disease that overlap between the 2 disciplines."}, {"Title": "Screening and intervention for illicit drug abuse: a national survey of primary care physicians and psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "Illicit drug abuse causes much morbidity and mortality, yet little is known about physicians' screening and intervention practices regarding illicit drug abuse.\nWe mailed a survey to a national sample of 2000 practicing general internists, family physicians, obstetricians and gynecologists, and psychiatrists to assess their screening and intervention practices for illicit drug abuse.\nOf 1082 respondents (adjusted response rate, 57%), 68% reported that they regularly ask new outpatients about drug use. For diagnosed illicit drug abuse, 55% reported that they routinely offer formal treatment referral, but 15% reported that they do not intervene. In multivariate logistic regression models, more optimal screening and intervention practices were associated with psychiatry specialty, confidence in obtaining the history of drug use, optimism about the effectiveness of therapy, less concern that patients will object, and fewer perceived time constraints.\nMost physicians reported that they ask patients about illicit drug use, but a substantial minority inadequately intervene in diagnosed drug abuse. Initiatives to promote physician involvement in illicit drug abuse should include strategies to increase physicians' confidence in managing drug problems, engender optimism about the benefits of treatment, dispel concerns about patients' sensitivity regarding substance use, and address perceived time limitations."}, {"Title": "Dysthymia and cyclothymia in psychiatric practice a century after Kraepelin.", "Abstract": "Kraepelin had a modern vision of affective illness. He hypothesized that affective recurrences arose from enduring dispositions of depressive, cyclothymic, irritable, or 'manic' types. These dispositions appeared as 'temperaments' in English translations of his work. In the extreme, such temperamental gloominess or moodiness is today officially diagnosed as 'dysthymic' or 'cyclothymic'; irritable and hyperthymic (or manic) dispositions have not received official sanction in the contemporary psychiatric nomenclature. This paper reviews recent research which supports Kraepelin's theoretical framework regarding dysthymic and cyclothymic dispositions both as clinically relevant extreme forms of temperament and as precursors of major affective episodes. Compelling lines of evidence along epidemiologic, clinical-descriptive, familial-genetic, therapeutic, and follow-up perspectives are summarized for each disposition. Much of what in contemporary psychiatry is considered to be in the realm of subthreshold affective conditions, overlaps considerably with Kraepelin's concepts of the trait affective dispositions described herein. Most importantly, although Kraepelin's observations were based primarily on hospitalized, severely ill affective patients, his broad vision still guides us today for understanding etiology and instituting public health and preventive measures in major affective episodes."}, {"Title": "Overview of the past contributions of animal models and their changing place in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Research utilizing animal models has been responsible for major advances in understanding psychiatric disorders. The first data based integrative theories of psychopathology grew largely out of animal research. A variety of animal models that have been developed have been critical in broadening our understanding of human development and in providing empirical support for the importance of early experiences for behavioral and neurobiologic development. The development of many widely used clinical psychopharmacologic agents has depended on the use of animal models. The above examples represent substantive contributions of animal models to investigations of fundamental aspects of psychopathology. There is no \"perfect,\" complete or comprehensive single animal model for any specific psychiatric disorder and contentious debates about the validity and/or usefulness of specific animal models persist. Animal models of diseases in medicine need to be understood in a historical and evolutionary perspective and their advantages as well as limitations recognized. There will likely never be an animal model in any field of medicine that is a perfect fit with the human condition, rather the emphasis in the development and study of disease models in animals needs to be on specific components of the human illness. Neither overextended cross-species comparisons nor unjustified negativism about animal models seems defensible. A major challenge in the continuing development and use of biobehavioral animal models in psychiatry is their relationship to the molecular neurosciences, including genetics, in understanding the mechanisms of mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Evolutionary perspectives on stress and affective disorder.", "Abstract": "Three general approaches to evolutionary perspectives in psychiatry include the following domains. (1) information from general medicine and physiology that involves defenses against infectious disease and predators, with obsessive compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) amongst the psychiatric results of this. (2) Sociophysiology assumes that normal brain functions mediate social interactions, including social rank hierarchy, in-out group formation, and family bonding. At times these function maladroitly resulting in psychiatric symptoms, for example, mania, persecutory delusions, and depression. (3) Evolutionary psychology explains self-sacrificing and generous behavior despite how genes act selfishly in natural selection theory, via the helping of relatives, reciprocal altruism, and manipulation of social contracts."}, {"Title": "A survey of threats and violent acts by patients against training physicians.", "Abstract": "The primary purpose was to determine the prevalence of various types of threats or assaults by patients against training physicians and to determine the psychological impact of the most distressing incidents. Differences between specialty of training and gender were examined.\nAn anonymous mailed questionnaire.\nThe Medical School of the University of Auckland, New Zealand.\nAll 160 postgraduate trainees in psychiatry, general medicine, surgery, and obstetrics and gynaecology. A response rate of 84% (n=135) was obtained.\nThe majority of trainees had been verbally threatened (n=91, 67%) or physically intimidated (n=73, 54%) at some time during specialty training, while another 41% (n=55) had witnessed Health Board property being damaged in their presence and 39% (n=53) had been physically assaulted. Psychiatry trainees were significantly more likely to experience the various types of threat or violence. Females (n=20, 38%) were significantly more likely than men (n=8, 10%) to report having been sexually harassed (chi2=14, d.f.=1, P < 0.001). The overall mean on the Impact of Event Scale for those who described the most distressing incident was 8. On only one occasion was a training director directly informed about a trainee's most distressing incident and most trainees (n=95, 70%) had not had training on protecting against assault or on managing violence.\nThese findings underscore a priority for developing programmes which effectively reduce threats and violence against trainees and which lessen the psychological sequelae of these incidents."}, {"Title": "Co-prescribing of SSRIs and TCAs in Australia: how often does it occur and who is doing it?", "Abstract": "To determine the frequency with which the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are used as add-on therapy to the tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) rather than as replacement therapy.\nThe data analysed were profiles of prescription records by date of supply to the patient. From within the national administrative dispensing claims database, the subset eligible for social security entitlements was identified as individuals by means of their coded permanent identification numbers (PINs). Following the initial supply of an SSRI in January 1996, the subsequent 6 months dispensing of SSRI and TCA antidepressants to these individuals was examined. The main outcome measure was the proportion of individuals to whom SSRIs and TCAs were dispensed concurrently, as an indirect measure of coprescription. In instances where a patient was receiving prescriptions for SSRIs and TCAs that had been written by the one doctor only, the major specialty of the doctor was investigated.\n55 271 PINs were dispensed 63 865 SSRI prescriptions in January 1996 which represented over half (52%) of the total community SSRI prescriptions dispensed in that month. The number of these patients meeting the criteria for coprescription of SSRIs and TCAs over the next 6 months was 2773 (5%). The coprescribing instances were highest in Queensland and the prescribers most frequently involved had psychiatry major specialty codes.\nAmong SSRI users there is a cohort of patients who, within the same time frame, are receiving supplies of a TCA, the nonselective drug that the SSRIs were designed to replace. This is indirect evidence of probable coprescription. Such combination use is of uncertain clinical and cost effectiveness, and carries additional risks. The SSRIs were included on the subsidy list in Australia on the basis of reasonable cost effectiveness as monotherapy compared with the TCAs. Our data imply that for some patients, antidepressant prescribing is inconsistent with the basis on which government subsidy was approved."}, {"Title": "HIT, hallucination focused integrative treatment as early intervention in psychotic adolescents with auditory hallucinations: a pilot study.", "Abstract": "Early intervention in psychosis is considered important in relapse prevention. Limited results of monotherapies prompt to development of multimodular programmes. The present study tests feasibility and effectiveness of HIT, an integrative early intervention treatment for auditory hallucinations, in community psychiatry.\nAdolescents with auditory hallucinations consecutively referred to Groningen Voices Outpatient Department. Independent research staff collected diagnosis, sociodemographics, psychiatric history, former treatment and current treatment status from medical files. The auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale, Groningen Social Disabilities Scale and five-point rating scales on characteristics and subjective burden of voices, and satisfaction with therapy were scored with semi-structured interview.\nGood compliance and high satisfaction with HIT treatment in most cases; 65% free of voices; majority demonstrates substantial improvement on mastery, anxiety, interference with thinking and social functioning; none worsened.\nIntegrative treatment as composed in the HIT-programme is feasible in community psychiatry and appears to be an effective early intervention in adolescents with schizophrenia both in reducing psychotic symptoms as improving quality of life."}, {"Title": "Severe traumatic brain injury.", "Abstract": "In western countries, injuries remain the leading cause of death in young adults (Jennett B.

Thirty one (41%) had suffered threats on at least one occasion. Although only 5.3% of the interviewees had been victims of actual physical assault, more than 10% said that an attempted assault had taken place. Most of the doctors who had experienced a violent episode (41/68) worried about the incident after return from work and yet only one was offered any counselling. Only nine (13.2%) had ever formally reported an incident to hospital management. Less than 10% of those questioned had received any formal training in the management of violent people, although 99% thought this would be a good idea.\nPaediatric trainees are involved in high risk situations at work (for example, child protection and casualty) which frequently result in exposure to violence. Very few report these incidents officially, but often underplay them. More attention should be given to the training and counselling needs of paediatric trainees."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric predictors of noncompliance in inflammatory bowel disease: psychiatry and compliance.", "Abstract": "Compliance with medications is very important in the management of many gastrointestinal disorders: in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), controlled trials have shown the benefit of prophylactic medical treatment in lowering the risk of recurrences. Our aim was to appraise the association between current psychiatric disorders and medication adherence in an unselected consecutive group of outpatients with IBD. In 85 unselected consecutive outpatients with IBD, a professional structured diagnostic interview and a psychiatric assessment, by the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-III-Reviewed, were carried out. In a stepwise regression analysis, compliance, as dependent variable, correlated positively with disease duration and inversely with both disease severity and presence of psychiatric disorders. In patients with IBD, preventive liaison psychiatry interventions seem indicated."}, {"Title": "Reengineering clinical psychiatry in academic medical centers: processes and models of change.", "Abstract": "Managed care poses a major threat to the future of clinical psychiatry in academic settings. High costs and an aversion to the business aspects of service delivery have left academic departments at a disadvantage in the marketplace. However, numerous departments have attempted to adapt to the current health care environment. On the basis of a review of these efforts, the authors identify the processes of change and seven models of change being employed to reengineer psychiatry within academic medical centers. The models are labeled transform, build, manage, buy, partner or affiliate, sell or lease, and consult. The authors discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these efforts and suggest three approaches to establishing the unique value of academic clinical services for purchasers and for the public. The first is to enhance productivity and clinical effectiveness through greater integration of clinical care, research, and training. The second is to take a leadership role in managing care, and the third is to advance the integration of behavioral health care with primary medical care and other specialties in the medical center."}, {"Title": "Melatonin in psychiatric disorders: a review on the melatonin involvement in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In normal subjects, the secretion of melatonin, the pineal hormone that regulates the rhythm of many functions, exhibits a circadian pattern synchronized with the day-night cycle. An alteration of this secretory pattern has been found in various psychiatric disorders (seasonal affective disorder, bipolar disorder, unipolar depression, bulimia, anorexia, schizophrenia, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder). At present, it is not known if such alterations have an etiological role or are secondary to the dysfunctions underlying the different disorders. In addition, we do not know if the involvement of melatonin in several disorders has the same significance in the pathophysiology of each disorder. An understanding of the role of the pineal hormone and of its alterations in psychiatric diseases could help to identify the biological mechanisms underlying such disorders."}, {"Title": "United Kingdom Alcohol Treatment Trial (UKATT): hypotheses, design and methods.", "Abstract": "The United Kingdom Alcohol Treatment Trial (UKATT) is intended to be the largest trial of treatment for alcohol problems ever conducted in the UK. UKATT is a multicentre, randomized, controlled trial with blind assessment, representing a collaboration between psychiatry, clinical psychology, biostatistics, and health economics. This article sets out, in advance of data analysis, the theoretical background of the trial and its hypotheses, design, and methods. A projected total of 720 clients attending specialist services for treatment of alcohol problems will be randomized to Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) or to Social Behaviour and Network Therapy (SBNT), a novel treatment developed for the trial with strong support from theory and research. The trial will test two main hypotheses, expressed in null form as: (1) less intensive, motivationally based treatment (MET) is as effective as more intensive, socially based treatment (SBNT); (2) more intensive, socially based treatment (SBNT) is as cost-effective as less intensive, motivationally based treatment (MET). A number of subsidiary hypotheses regarding client-treatment interactions and therapist effects will also be tested. The article describes general features of the trial that investigators considered desirable, namely that it should: (1) be a pragmatic, rather than an explanatory, trial; (2) be an effectiveness trial based on \"real-world\" conditions of treatment delivery; (3) incorporate high standards of training, supervision and quality control of treatment delivery; (4) pay close attention to treatment process as well as treatment outcome; (5) build economic evaluation into the design at the outset. First results from UKATT are expected in 2002 and the main results in 2003."}, {"Title": "Functional imaging studies: linking mind and basic neuroscience.", "Abstract": "The imaging of brain activity with positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging has assumed a central position in psychiatry. Functional imaging signals arise from changes in the neurophysiological parameters of glucose and oxygen consumption mediated by blood flow.\nRecent in vivo (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) neurochemical studies have established a quantitative coupling between the rates of glucose oxidation and glutamate neurotransmitter flux in rats and humans, thereby linking measured neurophysiological parameters to brain function.\nThese results show that in the awake, resting, and unstimulated states, 70%-80% of brain energy consumption is devoted to the same glutamate/glutamine neurotransmitter signaling as are the small percentages stimulated by tasks. Furthermore, in anesthetized animals, in which unstimulated activity is reduced, the total signal rather than a particular increment is required for a response.\nOn this basis, the total signal, as well as the difference in the signal, measures cortical neurotransmitter flux. The total signal in a region therefore contains valuable information about required brain activity. Although signal change is often more easily measured, certain PET and (13)C NMR methods can quantify total regional signal activity and thereby provide another measure of neurotransmitter activity."}, {"Title": "Legal pitfalls of psychiatric research.", "Abstract": "The increasing complexity of psychiatric research, including recent attempts to evaluate mental health legislation, suggests legal advice may be valuable in a wide range of research contexts.\nWe aim to illustrate both the legal pitfalls of research in psychiatry and the potential for solutions if the methods are carefully chosen.\nTwo examples of research are subject to legal analysis, one involving advance directives, the other the random discharge of compulsory out-patients.\nThis analysis illustrates that participation in research may expose clinicians to additional forms of liability, but the legal risks can be minimised through changes in the methods or additional safeguards.\nCollaboration between academic law and psychiatry can enrich research agendas and avoid serious legal pitfalls. We argue that sound legal advice should be sought at the planning stage of research in psychiatry, but the fear of liability should not lead to overly defensive research practices. The aim should be to strike the right balance between avoiding unacceptable exposure to liability and stifling innovative research."}, {"Title": "Medium secure forensic psychiatry services: comparison of seven English health regions.", "Abstract": "Regional medium secure developments have proceeded unevenly, with wide variations in resources to deliver services.\nTo compare patients admitted to seven (pre-reorganisation) regional services and styles of service delivery.\nA record survey of a complete sample of 2608 patients admitted on 3403 occasions between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 1994.\nServices differed according to location of patients before admission, their legal basis for detention, criminal and antisocial behaviour, diagnosis, security needs and length of stay. Regions with more resources and lower demand provided a wider range of services. Thames services were relatively under-provided during the study period, with North East Thames substantially reliant on admissions to private hospitals.\nUncoordinated development led to under-provision despite high demand. Certain regions prioritised offender patients and did not support local psychiatric services. New standards are required for service specification and resource allocation to redress inequality. Traditional performance measures were of limited usefulness in comparing services."}, {"Title": "Life-threatening tonsil hyperplasia probably induced by severe bulimia nervosa: a case report.", "Abstract": "A case of life-threatening tonsil hyperplasia probably induced by severe bulimia nervosa is reported. A 14-year-old obese Caucasian girl developed severe dyspnea caused by an enlarged hyperplastic lingual tonsil after referral to a child and adolescent psychiatry unit after a suicide attempt during a family conflict. The enlargement of the lingual tonsil was seen 6 months after the development of severe bulimia nervosa. Surgical extirpation of the hyperplastic tissue was done without complications. Hyperplasia of lymphatic tissue associated with bulimia nervosa has never been described before.\nThere was no atopic or infectious history in this case. Presumably, excessive vomiting led to extreme tonsillar growth by irritating the lymphocyte tissue. The relationship between bulimia nervosa and tonsil hyperplasia is far from clear.
