[{"Title": "Psychiatric aspects of toxoplasmosis: an Indian perspective.", "Abstract": "<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is one of the well-studied parasites because of its medical and veterinary importance, and its suitability as a model for cell biology and molecular studies. Latent toxoplasmosis in an immunocompetent host was considered benign until recently. The importance of this parasite has been steadily rising in the field of psychiatry and neurology as it has been implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders. Researchers in India have unfortunately restricted themselves to finding the prevalence of toxoplasma antibodies in special populations and animals. On the other hand, there has been increasing research interest worldwide in <i>T. gondii</i> for its effects on human behaviour, manifestations of which range from psychoses and neuroses to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. <i>Toxoplasma</i> infected organisms may be akin to living zombies. From changing the core natural defensive behaviour in mice to changing personality & leading to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans, <i>Toxoplasma</i> brings about subtle but significant & specific changes in its host. Surprisingly there is severe dearth of such studies from India even though prevalence rates of latent <i>Toxoplasma</i> infection are comparable, or in some regions, higher to those found elsewhere in the world. The potential for identifying <i>Toxoplasma</i> induced behavioural alterations is enormous in this part of the world which could have future treatment implications. It's high time that we move beyond researching the obvious and involve ourselves in more rigorous, novel and stimulating studies in the future."}, {"Title": "[Think, practice and write: the Revista Colombiana de Psiquiatr\u00eda and the history of Colombian psychiatry in the second half of the twentieth century].", "Abstract": "This article analyses the part played by Revista Colombiana de Psiquiatr\u00eda in the development of psychiatry as a medical speciality in Colombia.

Even though olanzapine is widely used in psychiatry, its effects on the architecture of pancreas, liver and kidneys are little known. The histology of pancreas especially has never been studied. For these reasons, the current study was designed to elucidate the toxic effects of chronic administration of olanzapine on pancreas, liver and kidneys and the enzymes released by these tissues in an escalating dose manner. <i>Methods:</i> Fourteen male rats were divided into two groups equally, the olanzapine group and the controls. Olanzapine was administered in a dose of 5\u00a0mg/kg/d for the first eight weeks, 10\u00a0mg/kg/d for next four weeks and 15\u00a0mg/kg/d through the last two week period of 14\u00a0weeks experiment. The controls received acidified saline only. Both the groups received restricted diet (20\u00a0g/12\u00a0h). The body weight and level of random blood sugar (RBS) were measured on a weekly basis. The levels of lipase, amylase, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were determined terminally. At the end of the experiment, the tissues were dissected out for histopathological evaluation. <i>Results:</i> Significant loss in body weight, change in the level of random blood sugar (<sup>\u2217\u2217</sup><i>P</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.05, <sup>\u2217\u2217\u2217</sup><i>P</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and significant rise in amylase and lipase levels (<sup>\u2217</sup><i>P</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.05, <sup>\u2217\u2217\u2217</sup><i>P</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were observed. However, the same treatment has shown no significant change in the levels of alanine and aspartate transaminases (<i>P</i>\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The pancreas has shown derangement of beta cells and fibrotic growth. A mild to moderate focal increase in glomerular cellularity, cellular proliferation and glomerular capsules with negligible basement membranes were observed in the kidneys. No changes were observed in the architecture of the liver. <i>Conclusion:</i> The findings of this study indicated that the incidence of adverse effects associated with olanzapine could be prevented/alleviated/delayed by allowing restricted diet."}, {"Title": "Staging cognitive impairment and incidence of dementia.", "Abstract": "In a background of interest in staging models in psychiatry, we tested the validity of a simple staging model of cognitive impairment to predict incident dementia.\nA large community sample of adults aged \u226555 years (N = 4803) was assessed in the baseline of a longitudinal, four-wave epidemiological enquiry. A two-phase assessment was implemented in each wave, and the instruments used included the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE); the History and Aetiology Schedule and the Geriatric Mental State-AGECAT. For the standardised degree of cognitive impairment Perneczky et al's MMSE criteria were applied. A panel of psychiatrists diagnosed cases of dementia according to DSM-IV criteria, and cases and sub-cases of dementia were excluded for the follow-up waves. Competing risk regression models, adjusted by potential confounders, were used to test the hypothesised association between MMSE levels and dementia risk.\nOut of the 4057 participants followed up, 607 (14.9%) were classified as 'normal' (no cognitive impairment), 2672 (65.8%) as 'questionable' cognitive impairment, 732 (18.0%) had 'mild' cognitive impairment, 38 (0.9%) had 'moderate' cognitive impairment and eight (0.2%) had 'severe' impairment. Cognitive impairment was associated with risk of dementia, the risk increasing in parallel with the level of impairment (hazard ratio: 2.72, 4.78 and 8.38 in the 'questionable', 'mild' and 'moderate' level of cognitive impairment, respectively).\nThe documented gradient of increased risk of dementia associated with the severity level of cognitive impairment supports the validity of the simple staging model based on the MMSE assessment."}, {"Title": "Creating a Pilot Educational Psychiatry Website: Opportunities, Barriers, and Next Steps.", "Abstract": "While medical students and residents may be utilizing websites as online learning resources, medical trainees and educators now have the opportunity to create such educational websites and digital tools on their own.

In this project, we were interested if clinical factors are associated with differential SNAP-25 expression. We examined the SNAP-25 isoform mRNA and protein levels in postmortem cortex Brodmann's area 9 (BA9) and BA24 (n = 29). Subjects were divided by psychiatric diagnosis, clinical variables including mood state in the last week of life and lifetime impulsiveness. We found affected subjects with a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder (AUD) had a lower level of SNAP-25b BA24 protein compared to those without AUD. Hispanic subjects had lower levels of SNAP-25a, b and BA9 mRNA than Anglo-American subjects. Subjects who smoked had a total pan (total) SNAP-25 BA9/BA24 ratio. Subjects in the group with a low level of anxious-psychotic symptoms had higher SNAP-25a BA24 mRNA compared to normal controls, and both the high and low symptoms groups had higher pan (total) SNAP-25 BA9/BA24 ratios than normal controls. These data expand our understanding of clinical factors associated with SNAP-25. They suggest that SNAP-25 total and isoform levels may be useful biomarkers beyond limited neurological and psychiatric diagnostic categories."}, {"Title": "Clinical Utility of Combinatorial Pharmacogenomics-Guided Antidepressant Therapy: Evidence from Three Clinical Studies.", "Abstract": "DNA of 258 patients with treatment-resistant depression was collected in three 8-10 week, two-arm, prospective clinical trials.

Here we present two contributions to statistical methodology for this purpose. First, we propose and compare a set of wavelet-domain procedures for fitting generalized linear models with scalar responses and image predictors: sparse variants of principal component regression and of partial least squares, and the elastic net. Second, we consider assessing the contribution of image predictors over and above available scalar predictors, in particular via permutation tests and an extension of the idea of confounding to the case of functional or image predictors. Using the proposed methods, we assess whether maps of a spontaneous brain activity measure, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging, can meaningfully predict presence or absence of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Our results shed light on the role of confounding in the surprising outcome of the recent ADHD-200 Global Competition, which challenged researchers to develop algorithms for automated image-based diagnosis of the disorder."}, {"Title": "Clinical Encounters with Immigrants: What Matters for U.S. Psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "About 3.2 percent of the population across the globe are migrants. Today, unprecedented numbers of people are relocating in the U.S. and more than ever, psychiatrists find themselves caring for immigrant patients. International migration is a multilayered issue that often has implications for the mental health of migrants. Thus, there is an increasing interest in understanding how the different factors associated with migration processes affect the mental health outcomes of immigrants. We group these factors into three categories: immigrant process, clinical encounter, and mental health services. When possible, we incorporate a gendered and life span perspective and suggest avenues for including what we know into the care of children, adults, and elderly psychiatric patients with immigrant backgrounds. We pay special attention to the immigrant paradox literature, which explains why some immigrants are healthier when they start their journey, and why their mental health deteriorates as they live longer in the host societies. We aim at providing psychiatrists an understanding of what to ask, assess, and consider when caring for patients who are international migrants."}, {"Title": "Teaching by Teleconference: A Model for Distance Medical Education across Two Continents.", "Abstract": "In Uganda, an estimated 120 obstetrician/gynecologists serve a population of 30 million people demonstrating the need to train additional skilled clinician leaders in reproductive health.

It requires close monitoring of serum concentration due to its narrow therapeutic window. Cardiac toxicity range from asymptomatic electrocardiographic changes to fatal arrhythmias may occur even at the therapeutic levels. We report a case of psychiatric inpatient who developed asymptomatic severe bradycardia most likely related to sinus node dysfunction due to acute lithium treatment at therapeutic level. After withdrawal of lithium, a time sequential improvement of severe bradycardia examined by repeated electrocardiogram, including Holter monitoring, suggested a relationship between the lithium toxicity and sinus node dysfunction. Other factors such as baseline sinus bradycardia and lower limit of normal thyroid function might be associated with severe bradycardia. This case emphasizes the need, when prescribing lithium, for clinicians to regularly monitor their patients' electrocardiogram and serum lithium levels to prevent serious or fatal complications, such as cardiac arrest."}, {"Title": "Impact of drug awareness and treatment camps on attendance at a community outreach de-addiction clinic.", "Abstract": "Substance misuse is an increasing problem in urban and rural India.

The co-author of the paper, Bosko Barac, witnessed their growth from 1966, collaborating in their organization from 1974 with the first Secretary General Gerald Grinschgl; elected for his successor after his unexpected death in 1985, he was leading the Kuratorium (Scientific Board) as Secretary General for 23 years, collaborating in this period with his Austrian partner and friend Helmut Lechner. In 2007, Barac handed over this responsible function to the co-author Vida Demarin. Starting when neuropsychiatry was a unique discipline, the INPC followed the processes of emancipation of neurology and psychiatry and their evolution to independent disciplines with new subspecialties. These respectable conferences greatly surpassed the significance of the two disciplines, neurology and psychiatry, granting collaboration of borderland medical and non-medical disciplines, connecting experts from the region, European countries and the world. Inaugurated in 'cold-war' times, in their first phase they enabled to make professional and human contacts between scientists from the two divided 'blocs' thanks to the 'non-aligned' position of the then Yugoslavia, fostering the ideas of mutual understanding and collaboration. On the other hand, the scientific development of the meetings took in the center of their study fields connecting the two disciplines, giving a quite unique quality to these meetings. For many years, the meetings cherished specific neurologic and psychiatric topics, at the same time planning increasing important topics of the 'borderland areas' in their programs. For the important achievements, they earned the title of the Pula School of Science and Humanism, promoting interdisciplinary scientific collaboration important for humanistic goals of medicine. Medicine, as science and practice, although founded on biological grounds, is primarily a human activity serving to individual man and the whole human race. Modern neurology and psychiatry are no longer restricted to diagnosing and curing brain and nerves or psychiatric disorders, and are nowadays important as a science of human mind and discipline caring about the human brain, the complex organ of each individual man, collective human consciousness and our mental life.

An exploratory analysis.", "Abstract": "Exposure to psychotropic agents, including lithium, antipsychotics and antidepressants, has been associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). This is especially concerning in older adults already at risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypernatremia with advanced aging. This study investigates whether commonly performed random urine-specific gravity (USG) tests can predict adverse NDI outcomes (CKD and hypernatremia) in psychotropic-exposed older adults.\nThis was a retrospective longitudinal study of 173 geriatric psychiatry patients (age \u226565 years) exposed to psychotropic medications. Our main continuous outcome was 'decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >10 mL/min/1.73 m(2)' over 5-year follow-up. Hypernatremia and acute kidney injury (AKI) were secondary outcomes. Whether baseline USG <1.010 predicted outcomes was assessed in bivariate and multivariate analyses.\nUSG <1.010 predicted hypernatremia episodes (sodium concentration \u2265150 mmol/L-28.1 versus 12%, \u03c7(2) = 4.7, P = 0.03). USG <1.010 [odds ratio 2.36 (95% confidence interval 0.93-6.0), P = 0.07], baseline eGFR and typical antipsychotic use independently predicted decrease in eGFR >10 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Patients with a single baseline sodium concentration of \u2265140 mmol/L and USG <1.010 have a 26.3% incidence of AKI and a 57.9% incidence of hypernatremia over the ensuing 5 years.\nIn psychotropic-exposed older adults, there appears to be a clinically important association between low USG and developing both hypernatremia and CKD. USG may be a useful surrogate measure for NDI-related outcomes in large administrative database studies, where ideal measures such as 24-h urine volume may not be available."}, {"Title": "Pattern and correlates of agitation in an acute psychiatry in-patient setting in a teaching hospital.", "Abstract": "Agitation among psychiatry inpatients can be a distressing and burdensome entity for patients, caregivers and staff. It has been poorly studied in low-middle income countries such as India both within acute care as well as long stay settings. 272 psychiatry admissions had 19.9% prevalence of agitation with the most common form being non goal directed physical agitation (13.6%). Episodes of agitation were most likely to occur on the 3rd or 2nd day of admission. Substance abuse [O.R.=2.51(1.05-5.99)] and the presence of persecutory delusions [O.R.=2.62(1.34-5.15)] were independently associated with agitation. It is difficult to predict violence in acutely ill individuals and there is evidence that the emergence of more serious aggression may be preceded by milder forms of agitation. Therefore, there is a need to identify various forms of agitation and its correlates. An understanding of these factors may assist in planning appropriate interventions that could improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden on caregivers."}, {"Title": "Clinical characteristics of children presenting with history of sexual abuse to a tertiary care centre in India.", "Abstract": "To study the clinical features of children with history of sexual abuse.\nA chart review of 40 children (<16 years) with history of Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) evaluated at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at NIMHANS during a three year period.\n52.5% (N=21) of the children came from broken families.

It has recently been applied in the context of psychiatric disorders (like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression and anxiety) that typically appear sometime during later childhood through to early adulthood. Psychiatric genetic counseling is emerging as an important service that fills a growing need to reframe understandings of the causes of mental health disorders. In this review, we will define psychiatric genetic counseling, and address important ethical concerns (we will particularly give attention to the principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice) that must be considered in the context of its application in adolescent psychiatry, whilst integrating evidence regarding patient outcomes from the literature. We discuss the developing capacity and autonomy of adolescents as an essential and dynamic component of genetic counseling provision in this population and discuss how traditional viewpoints regarding beneficence and non-maleficence should be considered in the unique situation of adolescents with, or at risk for, psychiatric conditions. We argue that thoughtful and tailored counseling in this setting can be done in a manner that addresses the important health needs of this population while respecting the core principles of biomedical ethics, including the ethic of care."}, {"Title": "[A survey about quality of care and user\u0092s' rights in Chilean psychiatric services].", "Abstract": "Quality of care and respect for the rights of users are critical to achieve positive health outcomes and respond appropriately to the expectations of people, particularly if they have mental illnesses.\nTo carry out a baseline diagnosis of quality of care and respect for rights in public outpatient psychiatric services.\nQuality of care and respect for patients'\u0092 rights was assessed by a mental health professional and a trained psychiatric service user in 15 ambulatory psychiatric services.

A number of biological properties of lithium have been discovered, including its hematological, antiviral and neuroprotective effects. In this article, a systematic review of the effect of lithium on hematopoietic, mesenchymal and neural stem cells is presented. The beneficial effects of lithium on the level of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and growth factors have been reported since 1970s. Lithium improves homing of stem cells, the ability to form colonies and HSC self-renewal. Lithium also exerts a favorable influence on the proliferation and maintenance of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Studies on the effect of lithium on neurogenesis have indicated an increased proliferation of progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and enhanced mitotic activity of Schwann cells. This may be connected with the neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects of lithium, reflected in an improvement in synaptic plasticity promoting cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis. In clinical studies, lithium treatment increases cerebral gray matter, mainly in the frontal lobes, hippocampus and amygdala. Recent findings also suggest that lithium may reduce the risk of dementia and exert a beneficial effect in neurodegenerative diseases. The most important mediators and signaling pathways of lithium action are the glycogen synthase kinase-3 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathways. Recently, to study of bipolar disorder pathogenesis and the mechanism of lithium action, the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) obtained from bipolar patients have been used."}, {"Title": "Open Dialogue Approach - about the phenomenon of Scandinavian Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "After twenty years of transformation of Finnish mental health care, in the late 80s and early 90s of the last century, incidence of schizophrenia in Western Lapland dropped from 35/100,000 to 7/100,000. This phenomenon is linked with Yrjo O. Alanen et al. who investigated schizophrenia treatment outcomes and psychosocial rehabilitation of people with schizophrenia. Investigators focused on an individually tailored psychotherapeutic recovery plan during patient's hospitalization, including care for patients' families. Within the \"Finnish National Schizophrenia Project\" the principles of the Need-Adapted Treatment were created and 50% of Finland's country gained access to mobile crisis intervention teams. Further studies were continued within \"Acute PsychosisIntegrated Treatment Project\" (1992-1993) which locally, in Western Lapland, proceeded into \"Open Dialogue in Acute Psychosis Project\" (ODAP) (1994-1997). In this approach, all important decisions regarding the patient, including hospitalization or pharmacotherapy, are discussed not only with the entire therapeutic team, but also with the patient and his family members.

In this paper, the meaning of the paradigm shift from postnantal to perinatal depression along with the changing treatment are discussed. Since the late 20 century, several large-scale epidemiological surveys on the incidence and outcomes of postnatal depression have concluded not only that postpartum depression is likely to occur at a high frequency, such as 10-15%, but that the subsequent maternal mortality rate as the number of deaths from suicide is higher than deaths due to obstetric medical conditions. Additionally, evidence of the negative impact of a mother's depression on the physical and mental development of children has been accumulated as well. Several studies regarding depression during pregnancy, such as on the relatively high frequency of prenatal depression or negative consequence of interrupted pharmacological treatment, should also be highlighted. These movements seemed to reflect the change in special attributes of depressive disorders and bipolar disorders, in that the term perinatal onset came to be preferred instead of postnatal, used in DSM-IV.

This review focuses on baseline EEG markers for two psychiatric conditions, namely major depressive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It covers potential biomarkers from EEG sleep research and vigilance regulation, paroxysmal EEG patterns and epileptiform discharges, quantitative EEG features within the EEG main frequency bands, connectivity markers and ERP components that might help to identify favourable treatment outcome.

Here we explore the relationships between subjective feelings and their underlying brain circuits from a computational perspective. We apply recent insights from systems neuroscience-approaching subjective behavior as the result of mental computations instantiated in the brain-to the study of emotions. We develop the hypothesis that emotions are the product of neural computations whose motor role is to reallocate bodily resources mostly gated by smooth muscles. This \"emotor\" control system is analagous to the more familiar motor control computations that coordinate skeletal muscle movements. To illustrate this framework, we review recent research on \"confidence.\" Although familiar as a feeling, confidence is also an objective statistical quantity: an estimate of the probability that a hypothesis is correct. This model-based approach helped reveal the neural basis of decision confidence in mammals and provides a bridge to the subjective feeling of confidence in humans. These results have important implications for psychiatry, since disorders of confidence computations appear to contribute to a number of psychopathologies. More broadly, this computational approach to emotions resonates with the emerging view that psychiatric nosology may be best parameterized in terms of disorders of the cognitive computations underlying complex behavior."}, {"Title": "Moving Toward Integrative, Multidimensional Research in Modern Psychiatry: Lessons Learned From Fragile X Syndrome.", "Abstract": "The field of psychiatry is approaching a major inflection point.

Specifically, we describe key genetic and molecular mechanisms (e.g., gamma-aminobutyric acidergic dysfunction and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5-associated long-term depression) relevant to the pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome as well as neural correlates of cognitive-behavioral symptoms. We then describe what we have learned from fragile X syndrome that may be applicable to other psychiatric disorders.

Research investigating the higher rates of unmet need among race/ethnic minority youths has focused primarily on policy, fiscal, and individual child or family factors that can influence service access and use. Alternatively, this study examines provider behavior as a potential influence on race/ethnic disparities in mental health care. The goal of the study was to examine whether patient (family) race/ethnicity influences physician diagnostic and treatment decision-making for childhood disruptive behavior problems. The study utilized an internet-based video vignette with corresponding survey of 371 randomly selected physicians from across the USA representing specialties likely to treat these patients (pediatricians, family physicians, general and child psychiatrists). Participants viewed a video vignette in which only race/ethnicity of the mother randomly varied (non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, and African American) and then responded to questions about diagnosis and recommended treatments. Physicians assigned diagnoses such as oppositional defiant disorder (48 %) and attention deficit disorder (63 %) to the child, but there were no differences in diagnosis based on race/ethnicity. The majority of respondents recommended psychosocial treatment (98 %) and/or psychoactive medication treatment (60 %), but there were no significant differences based on race/ethnicity.

The improvements include the development of new differentiation protocols resulting in selected neuronal populations (e.g., dopaminergic, GABAergic, hippocampal, and cortical), the widespread use of genome editing methods, and single-cell techniques. A major challenge awaiting in vitro disease modeling is the integration of clinical data in the models, by selection of well characterized clinical populations. Ideally, these models will also demonstrate how different diagnostic categories share overlapping molecular disease mechanisms, but also have unique characteristics.

It has been suggested that the autistic spectrum might be characterized by alterations of the brain's inference on the causes of socially relevant signals. However, it is unclear at what level of processing such trait-related alterations may occur.\nWe used a reward-based learning task that requires the integration of nonsocial and social cues in conjunction with computational modeling. Healthy subjects (N = 36) were selected based on their Autism Quotient Spectrum (AQ) score, and AQ scores were assessed for correlations with model parameters and task scores.\nIndividual differences in AQ were inversely correlated with participants' task scores (r = -.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-.68, -.13]). Moreover, AQ scores were significantly correlated with a social weighting parameter that indicated how strongly the decision was influenced by the social cue (r = -.42, 95% CI [-.66, -.19]), but not with other model parameters. Also, more pronounced social weighting was related to higher scores (r = .50, 95% CI [.20, .86]).\nOur results demonstrate that higher autistic traits in healthy subjects are related to lower scores in a learning task that requires social cue integration. Computational modeling further demonstrates that these trait-related performance differences are not explained by an inability to process the social stimuli and its causes, but rather by the extent to which participants take into account social information during decision making."}, {"Title": "[Impact of DSM-5: Application and Problems Based on Clinical and Research Viewpoints on Anxiety Disorders].", "Abstract": "In Japan, the impact of DSM-5 has been greater than we had imagined. The Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology organized a group for translation and the members spent many hours in this volunteer effort over a 2-year period. This highlights the significance of and expectations for DSM-5 in clinical practice in Japan. Regarding anxiety disorders, the highlights of changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5 are as follows. Firstly, the DSM-5 chapter on anxiety disorder no longer includes obsessive-compulsive disorder (which is included with obsessive-compulsive and related disorders) or posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder(which are included with trauma- and stressor-related disorders). However, the sequential order of these chapters in DSM-5 reflects the close relationships among them. Secondly, in DSM-IV, selective mutism and separation anxiety disorder were classified in the section \"Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence.\" They are now classified as an anxiety disorder. Through these two changes, at the beginning of the chapter, it can be clearly noted that anxiety disorders include disorders that share features of excessive fear and anxiety and related behavioral disturbances. Thirdly, panic disorder and agoraphobia are not associated in DSM-5. Thus, the former DSM-IV diagnoses of panic disorder with agoraphobia, panic disorder without agoraphobia, and agoraphobia without a history of panic disorder are now replaced by two diagnoses, panic disorder and agoraphobia, each with separate criteria. The co-occurrence of panic disorder and agoraphobia is now coded with two diagnoses. This change recognizes that a marked number of individuals with agoraphobia do not experience panic symptoms. For the present, this change ends the. controversy over the hierarchy between panic disorder and agoraphobia. The diagnostic criteria for agoraphobia are derived from the DSM-IV descriptors for agoraphobia, although the clarification of fears from two or more agoraphobia-related situations is now required, because this is a robust means for distinguishing agoraphobia from specific phobias. Also, the criteria for agoraphobia are now extended to be consistent with criteria sets for other anxiety disorders (e.g., a clinician's judgment of the fears as being out of proportion to the actual danger in the situation, with a typical duration of 6 months or more). From the above, these changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5 in anxiety disorders make our judgments faster and more efficient in clinical practice, and DSM-5 is more useful to elucidate the pathology. In this manuscript, we discuss the application and problems based on clinical and research viewpoints regarding anxiety disorders in DSM-5."}, {"Title": "Neurocognitive rehabilitation for addiction medicine: From neurophysiological markers to cognitive rehabilitation and relapse prevention.", "Abstract": "Currently, relapse prevention remains the main challenge in addiction medicine, indicating that the established treatment methods combining psychotherapy with neuropharmacological interventions are not entirely effective. Therefore, there is a push to develop alternatives to psychotherapy- and medication-based approaches to addiction treatment. Two major cognitive factors have been identified that trigger relapse in addicted patients: attentional biases directed toward drug-related cues, which increase the urge to consume, and impaired response inhibition toward these cues, which makes it more difficult for addicted people to resist temptation. Recent studies on newly detoxified alcoholic patients have shown that by using the appropriate tasks to index these cognitive functions with event-related potentials (ERPs), it is possible to discriminate between future relapsers and nonrelapsers. These preliminary data suggest that the ERP technique has great clinical potential for preventing relapse in alcohol-dependent patients, as well as for addictive states in general. Indeed, ERPs may help to identify patients highly vulnerable to relapse and allow the development of individually adapted cognitive rehabilitation programs. The implementation of this combined approach requires an intense collaboration between psychiatry departments, clinical neurophysiology laboratories, and neuropsychological rehabilitation centers. The potential pitfalls and limitations of this approach are also discussed."}, {"Title": "Contribution of non-genetic factors to dopamine and serotonin receptor availability in the adult human brain.", "Abstract": "The dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission systems are of fundamental importance for normal brain function and serve as targets for treatment of major neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite central interest for these neurotransmission systems in psychiatry research, little is known about the regulation of receptor and transporter density levels. This lack of knowledge obscures interpretation of differences in protein availability reported in psychiatric patients. In this study, we used positron emission tomography (PET) in a twin design to estimate the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors, respectively, on dopaminergic and serotonergic markers in the living human brain. Eleven monozygotic and 10 dizygotic healthy male twin pairs were examined with PET and [(11)C]raclopride binding to the D2- and D3-dopamine receptor and [(11)C]WAY100635 binding to the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor. Heritability, shared environmental effects and individual-specific non-shared effects were estimated for regional D2/3 and 5-HT1A receptor availability in projection areas. We found a major contribution of genetic factors (0.67) on individual variability in striatal D2/3 receptor binding and a major contribution of environmental factors (pairwise shared and unique individual; 0.70-0.75) on neocortical 5-HT1A receptor binding. Our findings indicate that individual variation in neuroreceptor availability in the adult brain is the end point of a nature-nurture interplay, and call for increased efforts to identify not only the genetic but also the environmental factors that influence neurotransmission in health and disease."}, {"Title": "[\"Psychological employees\" in psychiatry.

In a comparative perspective on the developments of Clinical Psychology in the German Democratic Republic, the example demonstrates not only the role of new psychological theories und methods in research and clinic in enabling the entry of the new profession into psychiatry, but also the importance of initial socio-economic and socio-politic frame conditions and decisions. The negotiation of the scope or limits of competences between doctors and psychologists created more than a professional niche inside the clinic; it changed psychiatry and psychology as academic branches in their structures due to the establishment of new Clinical Psychology departments.

In the consultation model, the psychiatry resident was available on call to the internists. Whereas, for the hybrid model psychiatry resident was stationed in the medical emergency and was available to assess the patients directly requiring psychiatric evaluation.\nDuring the first 9 months, 22,000 patients were evaluated in various emergency medical outpatient services, of which 383 (1.74%) were referred to the on-call psychiatry CL team. However, when the hybrid model was followed, the number of patients evaluated by the psychiatry resident increased to 594 out of 24,737 patients (2.4%) who reported to the emergency during the next 9 months period. There was a substantial increase in the proportion of cases with medical illnesses for which psychiatric consultation was sought, and a change in psychiatric diagnostic profile was observed too. When compared to the consultation model, the hybrid model was associated with greater use of medications, investigations, referrals and psychological measures in the emergency setting itself.\nFollowing a hybrid model in the medical emergency leads to an increase in the number of total psychiatric consultations and more extensive management of patients."}, {"Title": "Catatonia in adolescents: series of 12 inpatients.", "Abstract": "Catatonia is one of the most severe psychiatric syndromes that might be caused by many medical as well as psychiatric conditions.

Socio-demographic, clinical, admission and aftercare variables were investigated as possible predictors of readmission at 7, 30 and 90 days after discharge and were analyzed, controlling for dependency among same-patient observations.\nPrevious psychiatric history was the most important predictor of readmissions. The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of patients did not clearly influence readmission. Length of stay (LoS) was significant for readmission at 7 days even after controlling for other predictors and for same-patient dependence, in particular, for patients with previous admissions. Results suggest a protective role of a LoS higher than 28 days. In general, having a contact in community services did not turn out as protective from early readmission.\nThis paper contributes to increase the knowledge about factors that may predict the risk of early readmission. Implications for quality assessment in psychiatry emerged: readmission seems actionable by LoS and not by community follow-up."}, {"Title": "Post-Seclusion and/or Restraint Review in Psychiatry: A Scoping Review.", "Abstract": "It has been suggested that after an incident in which a patient has been placed in seclusion or in restraints, an intervention should be conducted after the event to ensure continuity of care and prevent recurrences.

This descriptive cross sectional study examined the perception and coping strategies of caregivers with a sample of 100 toward aggressive behavior by patients with severe mental illness in the outpatient and inpatient unit of the department of psychiatry in a tertiary care hospital. The data were collected by a semistructured interview using Revised Overt Aggression Scale-modified, Aggressive Behavior and Intervention Checklist, Ways of Coping Checklist-Hindi Adaptation and Impact of Patient Aggression on Carers Scale-Adapted. The caregivers perceived aggression in varying extent from the patients. Majority used problem-focused coping to deal with aggressive behavior. Most of the caregivers perceived insisting to take medicines and talking about patient's illness as the triggers for aggressive behavior which was managed by talking to the patient calmly, lovingly and by leaving the patient alone. The findings strongly suggest aggressive behavior as a frequent problem faced by family members of patient with severe mental illness.

The final section addresses questions regarding the impact of RDoC on clinical care.\nRDoC encourages investigators to investigate psychopathology dimensionally: greater or lesser degrees of healthy/adapted functioning of neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral processes (constructs) that cut across current diagnostic categories. Elucidation of the developmental components of RDoC constructs is needed to ensure they are fully validated. Integrating RDoC approaches into clinical research of child and adolescent psychopathology is contributing to our understanding of development as an aspect of the heterogeneity within DSM disorders and commonalities across seemingly disparate disorders. Continued efforts promise to also explain the processes that lead to mental illness in at-risk populations.\nIncorporating an RDoC approach in clinical research in child and adolescent psychiatry promises to be a fruitful avenue of research into the root causes and manifestations of mental illness, which will eventually lead to more precise treatments. Although the long-term aspiration of RDoC is to help reduce the burden of suffering for those with mental illnesses, it is not intended to be used for practical clinical purposes at this early stage."}, {"Title": "Mortality and Its Determinants in Late-Life Schizophrenia: A 5-Year Prospective Study in a Dutch Catchment Area.", "Abstract": "It is uncertain if the raised mortality in schizophrenia persists in later life. Register-based studies suggest that excess mortality continues, although at a lower level than in younger age groups. However, prospective follow-up studies of older schizophrenia samples are lacking.\nA cohort of 157 older patients (mean age at study entry: 68 years) diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in a psychiatric catchment area in Amsterdam, the Netherlands was studied. Standardized mortality rate (SMR) was estimated at a 5-year follow-up, in referral to the same age group in the general catchment area population. The impact on survival time of a range of independent demographic and clinical predictors was evaluated.\nThe cohort had an all-cause SMR of 1.89 (95% CI: 1.28-2.70). SMR was higher in men (2.60; 95% CI: 1.42-4.37) than in women (1.78; 95% CI: 1.02-2.90). All deaths were from natural causes.

We draw attention to a growing literature finding greater discounting of delayed reward, an important aspect of impatience, across a range of psychiatric disorders. We propose these findings are best understood by considering the goals and motivation for discounting future reward. We characterize these as arising from either the opportunity costs of waiting or the uncertainty associated with delayed reward. We link specific instances of higher discounting in psychiatric disorder to heightened subjective estimates of either of these factors. We propose these costs are learned and represented based either on a flexible cognitive model of the world, an accumulation of previous experience, or through evolutionary specification. Any of these can be considered suboptimal for the individual if the resulting behavior results in impairments in personal and social functioning and/or in distress. By considering the neurochemical and neuroanatomical implementation of these processes, we illustrate how this approach can in principle unite social, psychological and biological conceptions of impulsive choice."}, {"Title": "Cognitive trade-offs and the costs of resilience.", "Abstract": "Genetic, endocrinological, and psychological evidence demonstrates that resilience commonly trades off with sensitivity.

At the same time the current corrective, based in molecular genetics and cognitive neuroscience, is also likely to flounder due to its neglect for psychiatry's syndromal structure. We suggest adopting a new approach long used in reliability engineering, which also serves as a synthesis of these approaches. This approach, known as fault tree analysis, can be combined with extant neuroscientific data collection and computational modeling efforts to uncover the causal structures underlying the cognitive and affective failures in people with schizophrenia as well as other complex psychiatric phenomena. By making explicit how causes combine from basic faults to downstream failures, this approach makes affordances for: (1) causes that are neither necessary nor sufficient in and of themselves; (2) within-diagnosis heterogeneity; and (3) between diagnosis co-morbidity."}, {"Title": "[Negative symptoms of schizophrenia: historical aspects].", "Abstract": "The history of negative symptoms of schizophrenia rises early days of medicine in clinical and pathophysiological differences between positive and negative and their complex joint. Forming a set of typical core of symptoms, and some feature of a syndrome belonging to a specific pathophysiological mechanism, negative symptoms of schizophrenia emerge from old descriptions of clinical pictures, related to the overall look of madness, the heart of alienation, a central sign of early dementia, gradually more precisely describing the strange nature of the autistic withdrawal and schizophrenic apragmatism. At therapeutic era, negative symptoms have taken over the positive symptoms to establish an operational criteria whose importance lies in the progressive severity of this clinical type and in their contribution to therapeutic resistance. Despite the efforts of modern typological classifications, this work rehabilitates the old concept of \"unitary psychosis\" by defining a common symptomatic core to multiple clinical forms of psychosis, combining deficit of emotional expression and avolition, meaning a native psychopathology and a pathophysiology possibly in a common final way, and calling the arrival of new treatment strategies."}, {"Title": "[Negative symptoms in schizophrenia and substance-related disorders].", "Abstract": "Dual diagnosis of schizophrenia and substance-related disorders is common in psychiatric practice. Epidemiologic studies and report have established that the risk of a substance-related disorder was 4 to 5 times higher in a population of psychiatric patients than in the general population. However, little is known on the reason of this relationship and the treatments required. It's well known that a family history of psychosis is a risk factor of schizophrenia. Similarly a family history of substance use disorders increases the risk of using substances. Because the two disorders often occurred together, it could be hypothesized that a genetic risk factor is common. However, recent studies did not confirm this hypothesis and it seems that their genetic risks factor would be unrelated. Evidence now exists describing the different profiles of patients whether they used substance or not. Concerning negative symptoms clinical studies and meta-analyses have described fewer symptoms in schizophrenia patients with a substance use disorder. Among the different explanations that have been addressed, it seems that a lower capability of obtaining the substance could partly explain this relationship. Perhaps because patients with social withdrawal have more difficulties to find and spend the time required to obtain abused substances. At the opposite some products such as cocaine may relieve some symptoms especially anhedonia and alogia. However the link between substance-related disorders and negative symptoms is weak and decreases in more recent studies, probably because negative symptoms as well as addiction disorders are better characterized. Considering that treating psychiatric symptoms may not always lead to a decrease in the substance-related disorders but that patients who give up substances improve their psychotic symptoms, a therapeutic strategy should be planned for these dual disorders patients combining psychiatry and addiction interventions."}, {"Title": "A prospective non-interventional study for evaluation of quality of life in patients with Alzheimer's disease treated with rivastigmine transdermal patch.", "Abstract": "The primary objective of this multicentre, prospective, observational study was to assess whether there is improvement in the patients' quality of life under treatment with rivastigmine transdermal patch, as it is evaluated both by patients and their caregivers.

The DSM-5 Outline for Cultural Formulation was developed as a method of assessing the cultural factors affecting the clinical encounter. It calls for the assessment of the cultural features of the relationship between the patient and the clinician; however, there is a lack of debate about what this means in practice. Clinicians run the risk of withdrawal rather than cultural understanding when facing patients with different cultural backgrounds.

Suffering can be described, in this same sense, as an alteration in temporality. However, describing suffering as such only makes sense if we already have a conception of normal temporality. Yet for this, philosophical tradition offers not one but four competing conceptions. In the present article, we begin by briefly presenting these different conceptions. We then show how each one sheds light, by way of contrast, on a phenomenon whose meaning thus appears to be essentially negative. But does this phenomenon have a negative meaning only? Doesn't it correspond as much to a transformation as an alteration of temporality? This is what we will strive to establish in the third part of the article by relating suffering to hope, in a paradoxical sense of the term. Of the four conceptions of time likely to shed a contrasting light on the upheavals that suffering introduces into our life experience, the one described by Aristotle in Physics is historically the first. In particular, the notion of succession originates therein. But this conception does not account for what makes time the unit of a past, a present, and a future. In Book XI of Confessions, St. Augustine situated this unit not in nature but in the human mind. Hence, his definition of time as a distension of the soul and the necessary division into physical time and psychic time it entails. Husserl's Lessons on the phenomenology of the consciousness of internal time lend credit to this division, but they illuminate only the internal constitution of the \"present\", which is at the heart of the psychological conception of time. In Being and Time, Heidegger breaks away from this long-standing tradition; in his view, physical time and psychic also time take root in the temporality of \"planning\", understood to be a general form of openness to the world. But in our minds, \"being\" means more than \"being in the world\"; it also means, and by that very token, \"being for death\". Anguish is the fundamental experience that brings out this structural identity. As such, it lies at the core of Heidegger's conception of temporality. Nonetheless, is death the ultimate truth of time? This is what Paul Ricoeur denies in establishing an internal relationship between time and narration, for narration not only produces a synthesis of time, it also allows us to assume a future which, granted, presupposes death but does not remain its captive. This supports a fourth conception of time, that summarized by the notion of \"narrated time\". Narrative resources do not; however, cancel the multiple alterations that suffering introduces into temporality, which, by contrast, can be reduced - as we show in the second part of the article in reference to the preceding conceptions - to four descriptive features: dechronologization, reduction of the present to the instant, breakdown of the plan, and disintegration of the narrative. They explain why, in the presence of suffering, life seems more impossible than death. But at the same time, it leaves us with an enigma: Why doesn't the suffering human being always choose death? This enigma, above all, is the enigma of melancholic suffering. Hence, the privileged place given to melancholy in the last part of the article, where psychiatry encounters philosophy and justifies some distinctions that philosophy alone would not have dared make. A case in point is Minkowski's distinction, in Lived Time, between \"activity\" and \"waiting\", and also holds for our own distinction, following Minkowski, between planning time and hoping time, where hoping is to be taken in the deeper sense than implied by the common opposition between \"hope\" and \"despair\"."}, {"Title": "Lower-limb amputation and effect of posttraumatic stress disorder on Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient cost trends.", "Abstract": "Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient costs were analyzed for combat Veterans injured in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2001 to 2008. Patients had serious lower-limb injuries (n = 170) or unilateral (n = 460) or bilateral (n = 153) lower-limb amputation(s). Total costs over the follow-up period (2003 to 2012) and annual costs were analyzed. Unadjusted mean costs per year in 2012 U.S. dollars were $7,200, $14,700 and $18,700 for limb injuries and unilateral and bilateral lower-limb amputation(s), respectively (p < 0.001). Multivariate modeling indicated that annual cost declined after the first year in the VA for Veterans with limb injuries (p < 0.001, repeated measures). In contrast, annual costs doubled after 3-5 years with unilateral (p < 0.001) and bilateral amputation(s) (p < 0.001). Among amputees, prosthetics comprised more than 50% of outpatient cost; unadjusted mean cost per year for prosthetics was 7-9 times higher in comparison with Veterans with limb injuries. Amputation status was associated with an adjusted 3.12-fold increase in mean prosthetic cost per year (p < 0.001, generalized linear model). In addition, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was associated with increased prosthetic cost by amputation status (p < 0.001) and increased psychiatric and pharmacy costs (both p < 0.001). Results indicate relatively high and sustained outpatient costs driven by prosthetics following amputation. Finally, PTSD affected cost for multiple domains of health, highlighting the importance of accurate diagnosis, treatment, and support for PTSD."}, {"Title": "The Fountain of Health: Bringing Seniors' Mental Health Promotion into Clinical Practice.", "Abstract": "The Fountain of Health (FoH) initiative offers valuable evidence-based mental health knowledge and provides clinicians with evaluated tools for translating knowledge into practice, in order to reduce seniors' risks of mental disorders, including dementia.\nA presentation on mental health promotion and educational materials were disseminated to mental health clinicians including physicians and other allied health professionals either in-person or via tele-education through a provincial seniors' mental health network.

A Multi-Sited Field Study of Involvement of Relatives in Danish Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This article gives an account of aspects of a multi-sited field study of involvement of relatives in Danish psychiatry. By following metaphors of involvement across three sites of the psychiatric system-a family site, a clinical site and a policy site-the first author (J.O.) investigated how, and on what grounds, involvement of relatives is perceived in Danish psychiatry. Paradoxically, the current understanding of involvement of relatives fails to take into consideration the perspectives of the relatives per se and families that were being studied. By analyzing involvement from a discourse theoretical perspective laid out by Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, the aim of this study is to show how the dominant discourse about involvement at the political and clinical sites is constituted by understandings of mentally ill individuals and by political objectives of involvement. The analysis elucidates how a psycho-ideological discourse positions the mentally ill person as weak, incapable, and ineffective. By contrast, the supporting relative is positioned as a strong, capable, and effective co-therapist. Furthermore, the analysis considers how this dominant discourse of involvement is constituted by a broader discourse of neoliberalism and market orientation, which justifies involvement as a subtle institutionalization of social control. The article highlights that the role of the relative as a co-therapist may be contested by the families' discourse, which emphasizes issues concerning the responsibility toward the mental health of the ill individual as well as toward the psychological milieu of the family."}, {"Title": "Improving referrals to the Liaison service at the Royal United Hospital in Bath.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry liaison services provide the interface between mental and physical health in the acute medical hospital, however there can be logistical and operational difficulties to overcome.

Clinical guidance promoting safer medical care of patients detained under section 136 of the Mental Health Act.", "Abstract": "A new four-bed unit was opened in Bristol, UK, in 2014, for people detained under section 136 of the Mental Health Act. Police bring individuals posing a risk to themselves or others to a Place of Safety (PoS) in order to receive a mental health assessment. Individuals may be held for up to 72 hours, but cannot receive treatment against their will, unless assessed as lacking the capacity to refuse treatment. Issues requiring medical input arose in more than a third of patients, yet there was little guidance for trainees around the PoS. We conducted a survey which confirmed that robust clinical guidance was needed for junior doctors around medical assistance in this unique environment. We identified specific concerns around patient safety in relation to alcohol withdrawal, uncertainties around legislation and lack of clarity of who to call out of hours. Trainees felt they were working outside of their expertise. We collaborated with a variety of professionals to produce clinical guidance in line with best evidence, and made this easily accessible. We also gained a consensus that more experienced core trainees (SHOs) in Psychiatry should be the first point of contact. We then conducted a survey in June 2015, and found that doctors covering the PoS now felt there was sufficient guidance on most clinical scenarios, 100% consensus on who to contact and improved confidence in their ability to manage issues arising. In August 2015 we held an informal training session for the new intake of trainees on the rota. A subsequent survey revealed similarly positive results. Through this project, we were able to identify defects in a system, provide needed guidance to enable safer and more equitable care to a vulnerable group, and foster closer collaboration between junior doctors and managers in the design and use of services."}, {"Title": "Introduction of a Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis Protocol for Older Adult Psychiatric Patients.", "Abstract": "Hospital-Acquired venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults. In psychiatric patients these risks are increased due to multiple factors including poor mobility, restraint, catatonia, sedation, and conventional antipsychotic use. Diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric patients presenting with signs and symptoms of a VTE can be delayed due to a patient's communication difficulties, non-compliance, or attribution of symptoms to a psychosomatic cause. However, despite the increased risk, approved VTE prophylaxis protocols are infrequently used on Psychiatric wards. On one Older Adult Psychiatric Ward, two patients presented with VTE (a fatal pulmonary embolism and a symptomatic deep vein thrombosis) over a 6 month period demonstrating the necessity for prophylactic assessment. A baseline audit over 3 months showed that 63-83% of patients on the ward had received no assessment of VTE risk, on any given week, although this improved slightly following the critical incidents. A VTE prophylaxis protocol, based on NICE guidance for VTE risk assessment in Medical and Surgical patients, was developed with consideration given to additional Psychiatric risk factors. This took the form of a pro-forma with a tick-box design that included mobility assessment, VTE risk factors, bleeding risk factors, and guidance on prescribing decisions. This was implemented on an Older Adult Psychiatric ward and prophylaxis was provided to those meeting the threshold. Weekly audit of all pro-formas (including assessments completed within 48 hours of admission and prophylaxis prescription) was conducted after the pro-forma introduction from 1st February 2013 to 24th May 2013. Frequency of assessments increased after protocol implementation with between 36% and 85% of all patients being assessed for VTE risk post intervention. Fluctuations in numbers assessed may have related to ward pressures, staff changes, and practicalities of pro-forma use. After completion of the PDSA cycles the initiative was handed over to a specialist registrar for implementation across the other trust Older Adult Psychiatry wards, and further audit was planned to be conducted via junior doctors and established Quality Assurance systems.

The plan, do, study, act quality improvement framework was utilized. Baseline metabolic monitoring rates of patients prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications in the two psychiatry resident outpatient clinics were obtained. Rates were stratified based on time on medication (<1 year, \u22651 year) and parameter monitored. Metabolic monitoring rates subsequent to targeted changes were obtained. Problem solving with residents revealed barriers to monitoring, such as limited awareness of specific guideline recommendations and lack of convenient access to medical equipment (calibrated scales). Residents received education about atypical antipsychotic monitoring guidelines and side effect treatment. Residents were provided with calibrated scales. Atypical antipsychotic monitoring templates were introduced. Online surveys using were conducted to determine self-reported baseline-monitoring rates and comfort with guidelines following targeted change. The baseline metabolic monitoring rates of patients prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications was 9% (range: 0 to 17.6%) for youth in their first year taking an atypical antipsychotic medication and 58.9% (range: 29% to 100%) in subsequent years on medication. The results of relatively easy changes resulted in modest improvement in monitoring rates. The metabolic monitoring rate of a patient initiated on an atypical antipsychotic medication was 29% after targeted quality improvement measures were employed. Following quality improvement changes, residents reported increased knowledge about guidelines and increased monitoring for side effects. Use of a standardized data collection instrument to track monitoring of patients increased from 0% to 70% (range: 30% to 90%).

This is particularly prominent in long-stay psychiatric patients, such as those in secure settings. The Royal College of Psychiatrists recommends that psychiatrists should promote the physical health of their patients and liaise with other specialties. However, there is evidence that communication between psychiatry and other specialties is poor. A survey was carried out at the North London Forensic Service in June 2014. This looked at the views of clinical staff about the frequency and quality of feedback obtained when inpatients attend outpatient hospital appointments at local general hospitals. This survey highlighted the general perception among staff that feedback is poor, with 68.43% of respondents saying that they were \"very unsatisfied\" or \"unsatisfied\" with the level and quality of feedback. Clinical staff felt that many patients who attended hospital outpatient appointments, even when escorted by staff, returned with little or no feedback. This was confirmed by a baseline audit across 3 wards showing that details of the appointment (date, time, hospital, and specialty) were only documented in 54.5% of cases and the content of the appointment documented in even fewer cases. A form was designed by junior doctors that provided a simple framework of 6 questions to be answered at the outpatient clinic about the problem, diagnosis, and further actions needed. This was introduced and its impact assessed with a 3-month and 6-month audit of electronic notes, as well as a follow-up survey after 6 months. The audit showed significant improvement in the quality of feedback about the appointment at both the 3-month and 6-month point. The follow-up survey showed that 70% of respondents were aware of the form and 100% of those who were aware of the form had used it at least once and found it helpful. The general satisfaction level improved, but remained low, with 40% of respondents saying that they were \"very unsatisfied\" or \"unsatisfied\" with the level and quality of feedback. This QIP shows that the outpatient appointment form is a useful and effective tool when staff know about it and use it. We plan to look at the barriers to using the form and consider future solutions to the need for increased engagement with nursing staff stakeholders in future PDSA cycles."}, {"Title": "Psychological Medicine in Bart's: improving access and awareness.", "Abstract": "Providing good quality psychiatric services to patients who attend general hospital has been an area that has attracted a lot of interest.(1)(2) We know that more than one quarter of general hospital patients have a mental disorder, mental ill health impedes recovery from physical illness, and mental disorders are often unrecognised in patients with physical illness.

Our liaison team provides psychiatric assessment and treatment to inpatients at St Bartholomew's hospital that have been referred to us by our medical colleagues. We first observed that not all the medical teams are fully aware of the referral process and that they were keen on having training sessions and further education on the area of psychological medicine. Another area that we focused on during this process was making sure that we maintained quality of service provision while our service was in transition due to relocation. Ward based information sessions and meetings were held. An introductory session to psychiatry was also provided on medical induction. Information leaflets with referral process and contact numbers were produced for staff at ward level and for administrative support. A liaison psychiatry pathway was created to incorporate the changes that occurred after the relocation of our service. Following these interventions there was significant improvement among the staff in recognising and referring patients with psychiatric issues through the use of liaison psychiatry pathway.

Psychotic disorders in early adulthood are most frequently diagnosed with the schizophrenia spectrum or mood disorders. However, they may be the manifestation of neurologic, endocrine or immunologic disease. Individuals with NDD's such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) may also present initially in adulthood. Therefore it is not uncommon that the psychiatrist is the first physician to assess a psychotic patient with underlying medical illness or a NDD. Failure to identify the underlying cause will delay appropriate management. Overdiagnosis of primary psychiatric disorders may be misleading in planning the treatment, as evidence-based treatment algorithms relevant to psychosis are intended for primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, and symptomatic treatment may result in unnecessary exposure to antipsychotic drugs. Exclusion of other medical conditions and NDD's is essential before establishing a diagnosis of schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "A critical appraisal of atomoxetine in the management of ADHD.", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurobehavioral disorder beginning in childhood and often continuing into adulthood. A wealth of data shows that ADHD symptoms respond well to pharmacological treatment. Stimulant medications, including amphetamine and methylphenidate, are most commonly used to treat ADHD. However, with the approval of atomoxetine (Strattera(\u00ae), [ATX]) by the US Food and Drug Administration in late 2002, an effective non-stimulant option became available. The US Food and Drug Administration approved ATX for the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults. Although the effect size of ATX is generally lower than that of stimulants, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Practice Parameter for the treatment of ADHD lists ATX as a first-line treatment option. ATX is widely prescribed and accounted for 6% of the prescriptions of ADHD visits in the US in 2010. Numerous trials have found that ATX improves quality of life and emotional lability in addition to core ADHD symptoms. Although some improvement may be seen in a patient as early as one week after the initiation of treatment, ATX generally takes longer to have a full effect. The median time to response using 25% improvement in ADHD symptoms in pooled trials was 3.7 weeks. Data from these trials indicate that the probability of symptom improvement may continue to increase up to 52 weeks after treatment is initiated. ATX has been shown to be safe and effective in combination with stimulants. It has also been studied systematically in subjects with ADHD and comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.

Moreover, current drugs used in neurology and psychiatry alleviate the symptoms, while hardly curing any cause of disease, basically because the etiology of most neuro-psychic syndromes is but poorly known. This review argues that this largely derives from the unbalanced prevalence in neuroscience of the analytic reductionist approach, focused on the cellular and molecular level, while the understanding of integrated brain activities remains flimsier. The decline of drug discovery output in the last decades, quite obvious in neuropharmacology, coincided with the advent of the single target-focused search of potent ligands selective for a well-defined protein, deemed critical in a given pathology. However, all the widespread neuro-psychic troubles are multi-mechanistic and polygenic, their complex etiology making unsuited the single-target drug discovery. An evolving approach, based on systems biology considers that a disease expresses a disturbance of the network of interactions underlying organismic functions, rather than alteration of single molecular components. Accordingly, systems pharmacology seeks to restore a disturbed network via multi-targeted drugs. This review notices that neuropharmacology in fact relies on drugs which are multi-target, this feature having occurred just because those drugs were selected by phenotypic screening in vivo, or emerged from serendipitous clinical observations. The novel systems pharmacology aims, however, to devise ab initio multi-target drugs that will appropriately act on multiple molecular entities. Though this is a task much more complex than the single-target strategy, major informatics resources and computational tools for the systemic approach of drug discovery are already set forth and their rapid progress forecasts promising outcomes for neuropharmacology."}, {"Title": "Human compulsivity: A perspective from evolutionary medicine.", "Abstract": "Biological explanations address not only proximal mechanisms (for example, the underlying neurobiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder), but also distal mechanisms (that is, a consideration of how particular neurobiological mechanisms evolved).

The current paper will consider compulsive symptoms in obsessive-compulsive and related disorders and behavioral addictions from this evolutionary perspective. It will argue that while obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is typically best conceptualized as a dysfunction, it is theoretically and clinically valuable to understand some symptoms of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders in terms of useful defenses. The symptoms of behavioral addictions can also be conceptualized in evolutionary terms (for example, mismatch), which in turn provides a sound foundation for approaching assessment and intervention."}, {"Title": "Patient Profiles in Dutch Forensic Psychiatry Based on Risk Factors, Pathology, and Offense.", "Abstract": "Forensic psychiatry embodies a highly heterogeneous population differing widely in terms of diagnoses, crimes committed, and risk factors.

Even though gabapentin is sometimes considered as a treatment option for alcohol and substance abuse, it is important to monitor for drug-seeking behaviors. A history of alcohol or substance abuse appears to be an important part of a patient's medical history when evaluating their risk for addiction and dependence behaviors. Health care providers need to be aware of this risk in their patients and monitor their patients for signs of abuse and dependence along with withdrawal symptoms."}, {"Title": "[Conflict of Interest Guidelines of the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology: Current Status and Considerations in the Area of Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "In 2011, the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology released the Guidelines on Conflict of Interest(COI) in Clinical Research and detailed regulations. According to the Guidelines, the COI Committee has been engaged in COI management for a one-year trial period. The members of the Society have to disclose their COIs at the time of presentations, manuscript submissions, and publications; the board and committees members have to disclose their COIs to the President of the Society; and the President reports these COI disclosures to the COI Committee. In this article, we provide a summary of this year's COI disclosures: among the 455 board and committees members, 297 were without COIs (68.5%); 98 (excluding the following two problematic cases) disclosed COIs (23.1%, excluding the following two cases); two cases were discussed regarding whether or not they were problematic (0.44%); 11 (2.4%) cases have not yet been reviewed because of a delay in disclosure; and 25 cases have yet to be disclosed (5.5%). Responding to serious COI-related affairs in other disease areas, public interest in the COI ssue has been increasing.

Therefore, the goal of departments of psychiatry in universities is to train the next generation of leaders in psychiatry who can promote innovative and personalized care for patients. In terms of the development of research-oriented human resources, it is necessary to emphasize the importance of prioritizing patients' demands and education regarding the following points:1) After the critical appraisal of papers, we have to elucidate what we know and what we do not know to clearly determine the purpose of research (Social or scientific value). 2) We have to use accepted methods, including statistical techniques, to produce reliable and valid data (Scientific validity). In addition, we should introduce ethical considerations into clinical research, including informed consent. The development of research-oriented human resources is indispensable for future research focused on the needs of psychiatric patients and their families."}, {"Title": "[Issues in Psychiatric Care as Observed in Recent Legal Proceedings Involving Medical Treatment].", "Abstract": "Among recent court cases involving medical treatment (medical litigation), civil proceedings focused on compensation claims began clearly trending upward around 1999. This trend peaked in 2004, after which the number of cases declined slightly and remained mostly flat. Over the past year or two, however, cases seem to be on the rise once again. Fluctuations in the volume of medical litigation have been attributed to various factors, but there is little doubt that careless medical errors and incidents of serious medical malpractice, as well as media coverage, are major factors in the recent increase. Although there has been no significant change in the actual number of lawsuits involving psychiatric care, it is possible to identify risk resulting from circumstances unique to psychiatry (prejudice surrounding psychiatric care, etc.). In this paper, the author will illustrate current trends in medical litigation and important aspects of judicial decisions related to health care. Furthermore, based on his many years of experience acting for the defense in psychiatric care litigation, the author will offer suggestions for promoting mutual understanding between psychiatry and the law that will, in turn, contribute to both \"advocacy for legitimate psychiatric care\" and \"the quest for ideal psychiatric care\"."}, {"Title": "Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder: A New Diagnostic Approach to Chronic Irritability in Youth.", "Abstract": "(Reprinted from the <i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i> 2014; 171:918-924 with permission from American Psychiatric Association Publishing)."}, {"Title": "Emotion Dysregulation in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.", "Abstract": "(Reprinted from the <i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i> 2014; 171:276-293, with permission from American Psychiatric Association Publishing)."}, {"Title": "Treatment of Maternal Depression in a Medication Clinical Trial and Its Effect on Children.", "Abstract": "(Reprinted from the <i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i> 2015; 172:450-459, with permission from American Psychiatric Association Publishing)."}, {"Title": "Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents With Eating Disorders.", "Abstract": "(Reprinted from the <i>Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry</i> 2015;54(5):412-425 with permission from the Academy)."}, {"Title": "The Supreme Court of Canada Ruling on Physician-Assisted Death: Implications for Psychiatry in Canada.", "Abstract": "On February 6, 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the prohibition of physician-assisted death (PAD) was unconstitutional for a competent adult person who \"clearly consents to the termination of life\" and has a \"grievous and irremediable (including an illness, disease, or disability) condition that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition.\" The radically subjective nature of this ruling raises important questions about who will be involved and how this practice might be regulated.

Effective stigma-reduction interventions for physicians require a better understanding of explicit (that is, conscious and controllable) and implicit (that is, subconscious and automatic) forms of bias, and of predictors and moderators of stigma.\nMembers of a Canadian university psychiatry department and of the Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) were invited to participate in a web-based study consisting of 2 measures of explicit attitudes, the Social Distance Scale (SDS) and the Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC), and 1 measure of implicit attitudes, the Implicit Association Test (IAT).\nThirty-five psychiatry residents and 68 psychiatrists completed the study (response rates of 12.1% for the university sample and 3.3% for the CPA sample). Participants desired greater social distance from the vignette patient with schizophrenia. Mean IAT scores, although negative, did not reach the threshold for a meaningful effect size. Patient contact positively predicted IAT scores, while age, sex, and level of training (resident, compared with psychiatrist) did not. Neither patient contact nor implicit attitudes predicted SDS or OMS-HC scores.\nPsychiatrists did not differ from psychiatry residents on any measures of explicit or implicit attitudes toward mental illness. Explicit attitudes toward people with mental illness were relatively negative; implicit attitudes were neither negative nor positive; and implicit and explicit attitudes were not correlated. Greater patient contact predicted more positive implicit attitudes, but did not predict explicit attitudes."}, {"Title": "Cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia: a systematic review of meta-analyses.", "Abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). A neurocognitive profile characterized by widespread cognitive deficits across multiple domains in the context of substantial intellectual impairment, which appears to antedate illness onset, is a replicated finding in SZ. There is no specific neuropsychological signature that can facilitate the diagnostic differentiation of SZ and BD, notwithstanding, neuropsychological deficits appear more severe in SZ. The literature in this field has provided contradictory results due to methodological differences across studies. Meta-analytic techniques may offer an opportunity to synthesize findings and to control for potential sources of heterogeneity. Here, we performed a systematic review of meta-analyses of neuropsychological findings in SZ and BD. While there is no conclusive evidence for progressive cognitive deterioration in either SZ or BD, some findings point to more severe cognitive deficits in patients with early illness onset across both disorders. A compromised pattern of cognitive functioning in individuals at familiar and/or clinical risk to psychosis as well as in first-degree relatives of BD patients suggests that early neurodevelopmental factors may play a role in the emergence of cognitive deficits in both disorders. Premorbid intellectual impairment in SZ and at least in a subgroup of patients with BD may be related to a shared genetically determined influence on neurodevelopment."}, {"Title": "Delayed drug interactions in psychiatry: armodafinil and risperidone as a potential case in point.", "Abstract": "Modafinil or armodafinil (ar/mod) augmentation of antipsychotic medication in schizophrenia patients may be considered with a view to reduce negative symptoms associated with the illness or excessive daytime drowsiness due to any cause. The available data suggest that there is no role for ar/mod in reducing negative symptom burden. A recent pharmacokinetic (PK) study suggested that armodafinil (250 mg/d) reduces key PK parameters of risperidone by about 50%, and key PK parameters of 9-hydroxyrisperidone (paliperidone) by about 20%-30%, probably through induction of CYP3A4. Ar/mod augmentation is therefore best avoided in patients receiving risperidone or paliperidone (and most other atypical antipsychotic drugs, as well, because most atypical antipsychotics are metabolized by enzymes that ar/mod induce). If the ar/mod-antipsychotic drug combination is necessary, for whatever reason, then the dose of the atypical antipsychotic drug may need to be appropriately raised. If this is not done, relapse may occur; because the relapse may postdate the introduction of ar/mod by many months, the causal role of a metabolic drug interaction may not be suspected, and physicians may attribute the relapse to the natural course of the illness. Physicians need to be aware that any agent that induces the metabolism of psychotropic drugs that are used in maintenance therapy may, through lowered psychotropic drug levels, result in a delayed drug interaction that is characterized by illness relapse."}, {"Title": "Defining continuity of care from the perspectives of mental health service users and professionals: an exploratory, comparative study.", "Abstract": "Continuity of care (COC) is central to the organization and delivery of mental health services.

Service users prioritized access, information, peer support and avoiding services; health professionals most frequently referred to staff, cross-sectional and temporal COC. Service users alone identified service avoidance, peer support and day centres as COC elements; professionals alone identified cross-sectional working.\nImportant similarities and differences exist in service user and professional conceptualizations of COC. Further research is necessary to explore these differences, prior to integrating service user and professional perspectives in a validated COC framework which could enable the development and evaluation of interventions to improve COC, informing policy and practice."}, {"Title": "[Questionnaire for Investigating Therapeutic Alliance in Forensic Setting (FTBF): Results of a Pilot Study].", "Abstract": "The relation between patient and therapist has a substantial effect on the success of psychotherapy.

These guidelines, however, include many discrepancies, both in terms of vocabulary and structure. Many expert evaluators also decry the absence of consensual and reliable evaluation tools. To address this gap, we present the results of an evaluation of 58 existing guidelines in four major health science fields (medicine and epidemiology; nursing and health education; social sciences and public health; psychology/psychiatry, research methods and organization) by expert (n = 16) and peer (n = 40) users (e.g., article reviewers, experts allocating funds, editors).

The comprehensive Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to assess their 12-month prevalence rates of DSM-IV mental disorders, and a comprehensive questionnaire was adapted to explore various factors, such as socio-demographics, working and living conditions, or experiences of abuse.\nOn average, participants began their commercial sex work at 18.5\u2009years old (range: 10-45). Their main motives for sex work were coercion (49.4%) and the necessity to financially support families (54.8%). In total, 224 FSW (86.5%) wanted to quit commercial sex work. A mental disorder within the past 12\u2009months was reported by 100 FSW (38.6%), with drug abuse clearly being the most prevalent diagnosis (15.4%). Sexual, physical, and emotional abuse were very common among the FSW, and substance use disorders (SUD) were significantly more prevalent in persons who experienced emotional abuse (OR\u2009=\u20092.2). Prevalence rates of any mental disorder and SUD were higher in women who did sex work to support their family, whereas mood disorders were more frequent in those who needed the money to pay debts.

Campbell's criticism is based on an interventionist-inspired denial that mechanisms and rational connections underpin physical and mental causation, respectively, and hence underpin levels of explanation. These claims echo some superficially similar remarks in Wittgenstein's Zettel. But attention to the context of Wittgenstein's remarks suggests a reason to reject explanatory minimalism in psychiatry and reinstate a Wittgensteinian notion of levels of explanation. Only in a context broader than the one provided by interventionism is that the ascription of propositional attitudes, even in the puzzling case of delusions, justified. Such a view, informed by Wittgenstein, can reconcile the idea that the ascription mental phenomena presupposes a particular level of explanation with the rejection of an a priori claim about its connection to a neurological level of explanation."}, {"Title": "Correlation between the Mini Mental State Examination-Korean version and the Measurement of Quality of the Environment in the institutionalized elderly.", "Abstract": "[Purpose] This study aimed to investigate the correlation between the cognitive level of the elderly and their attitude towards the living environment.

I describe and contextualize historically this process using Thomas Clouston, a Scottish Psychiatrist and widely-read textbook author, as a representative pre-Kraepelinian diagnostician. Clouston used three major diagnostic categories based on symptomatic presentation--mania, melancholia and paranoia--all derived from the beginnings of modern psychiatry in the early nineteenth century. He observed that these categories contained good-outcome cases and those progressing to 'secondary dementia'. Kraepelin designed his categories of DP and MDI to reflect putative distinct disease processes reflected in their course and outcome. Although Clouston and Kraepelin each saw similar patients, their nosologies started from different first principles: symptomatic presentation versus presumed etiology. Driven largely by social forces with American psychiatry, Kraepelin's system spread throughout the United States in the succeeding decades replacing older diagnostic approaches typified by Clouston's. In 1896, American psychiatry was demoralized as the idyllic asylums had become overcrowded, isolated scientific backwaters. Kraepelin's nosology was derived from and was championed by individuals working in high-status research-based university psychiatric clinics. It brought excitement, the promise of subsequent research breakthroughs and the high prestige then associated with German biomedicine. Scientific research comparing the older and Kraepelinian diagnostic systems played little role in this transition. Using empirical methods to guide changes in our diagnostic system is a recent development in the history of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Adjunctive sarcosine plus benzoate improved cognitive function in chronic schizophrenia patients with constant clinical symptoms: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Objectives Hypofunction of NMDA receptor is implicated in the pathophysiology, particularly cognitive impairment, of schizophrenia. Sarcosine, a glycine transporter I (GlyT-1) inhibitor, and sodium benzoate, a d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) inhibitor, can both enhance NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission. We proposed simultaneously inhibiting DAAO and GlyT-1 may be more effective than inhibition of either in improving the cognitive and global functioning of schizophrenia patients. Methods This study compared add-on sarcosine (2\u2009g/day) plus benzoate (1\u2009g/day) vs. sarcosine (2\u2009g/day) for the clinical symptoms, as well as the cognitive and global functioning, of chronic schizophrenia patients in a 12-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale every 3 weeks. Seven cognitive domains, recommended by the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Committee, were measured at weeks 0 and 12. Results Adjunctive sarcosine plus benzoate, but not sarcosine alone, improved the cognitive and global functioning of patients with schizophrenia, even when their clinical symptoms had not improved.

In an effort to explain how that decision came about, this paper reviews some historical scientific theories and arguments that first led to the placement of homosexuality in DSM-I and DSM-II as well as alternative theories that eventually led to its removal from DSM III and subsequent editions of the manual. The paper concludes with a discussion of the sociocultural aftermath of that 1973 decision."}, {"Title": "The Historical Development of Immunoendocrine Concepts of Psychiatric Disorders and Their Therapy.", "Abstract": "Relationships between the central nervous, immune and endocrine systems are a focus of psychiatric research, particularly in depression and schizophrenia. The field has long antecedents. Observed phenomena attributable to these relationships date back to the Neolithic era. Immunoendocrine theories in the broadest sense are recorded in antiquity. In the 19th century, Kraepelin and Wagner-Jauregg reported pioneering clinical observations in psychiatric patients. Von Basedow, Addison and Cushing described psychiatric symptoms in patients suffering from endocrine diseases. The 20th century opened with the identification of hormones, the first, adrenaline, chemically isolated independently by Aldrich und Takamine in 1901. Berson and Yalow developed the radioimmunoassay (RIA) technique in 1959 making it possible to measure levels of hormones and cytokines. These developments have enabled great strides in psychoimmunoendocrinology. Contemporary research is investigating diagnostic and therapeutic applications of these concepts, for example by identifying biomarkers within the endocrine and immune systems and by synthesizing and testing drugs that modulate these systems and show antidepressant or antipsychotic properties."}, {"Title": "A cross-platform solution for light field based 3D telemedicine.", "Abstract": "Current telehealth services are dominated by conventional 2D video conferencing systems, which are limited in their capabilities in providing a satisfactory communication experience due to the lack of realism. The \"immersiveness\" provided by 3D technologies has the potential to promote telehealth services to a wider range of applications. However, conventional stereoscopic 3D technologies are deficient in many aspects, including low resolution and the requirement for complicated multi-camera setup and calibration, and special glasses. The advent of light field (LF) photography enables us to record light rays in a single shot and provide glasses-free 3D display with continuous motion parallax in a wide viewing zone, which is ideally suited for 3D telehealth applications. As far as our literature review suggests, there have been no reports of 3D telemedicine systems using LF technology. In this paper, we propose a cross-platform solution for a LF-based 3D telemedicine system. Firstly, a novel system architecture based on LF technology is established, which is able to capture the LF of a patient, and provide an immersive 3D display at the doctor site. For 3D modeling, we further propose an algorithm which is able to convert the captured LF to a 3D model with a high level of detail. For the software implementation on different platforms (i.e., desktop, web-based and mobile phone platforms), a cross-platform solution is proposed. Demo applications have been developed for 2D/3D video conferencing, 3D model display and edit, blood pressure and heart rate monitoring, and patient data viewing functions. The demo software can be extended to multi-discipline telehealth applications, such as tele-dentistry, tele-wound and tele-psychiatry. The proposed 3D telemedicine solution has the potential to revolutionize next-generation telemedicine technologies by providing a high quality immersive tele-consultation experience."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of a nurse practitioner-led extended hours mental health liaison nurse service based in the emergency department.", "Abstract": "To evaluate a nurse practitioner (NP)-led extended hours mental health liaison nurse (MHLN) service based in the emergency department (ED) of an inner city teaching hospital in Sydney and to explicate a model of care that is transferable across a broad range of ED settings, both in metropolitan and rural contexts.\nThis mixed-methods evaluation encompassed descriptive data on ED mental health presentations, quantifying waiting times for MHLN involvement and interviews with MHLN team members at the commencement of the evaluation and 12 months later.

Though these models have been useful for advancing our theoretical understanding and facilitating important lines of research, translation of these models and their application within the clinical arena have been limited-partly because of lack of integration and synthesis. Cognitive neuroscience provides a novel perspective for understanding and modeling mood disorders. This selective review of influential neurocognitive models develops an integrative approach that can serve as a template for future research and the development of a clinically meaningful framework for investigating, diagnosing, and treating mood disorders.\nA selective literature search was conducted using PubMed and PsychINFO to identify prominent neurobiological and neurocognitive models of mood disorders.\nMost models identify similar neural networks and brain regions and neuropsychological processes in the neurocognition of mood, however, they differ in terms of specific functions attached to neural processes and how these interact. Furthermore, cognitive biases, reward processing and motivation, rumination, and mood stability, which play significant roles in the manner in which attention, appraisal, and response processes are deployed in mood disorders, are not sufficiently integrated. The inclusion of interactions between these additional components enhances our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of mood disorders.\nThrough integration of key cognitive functions and understanding of how these interface with neural functioning within neurocognitive models of mood disorders, a framework for research can be created for translation to diagnosis and treatment of mood disorders."}, {"Title": "The Art and Science of Learning, Teaching, and Delivering Feedback in Psychosomatic Medicine.", "Abstract": "The teaching and learning of psychosomatic medicine has evolved with the better understanding of effective teaching methods and feedback delivery in medicine and psychiatry.\nWe sought to review the variety of teaching methods used in psychosomatic medicine, to present principles of adult learning (and how these theories can be applied to students of psychosomatic medicine), and to discuss the role of effective feedback delivery in the process of teaching and learning psychosomatic medicine.\nIn addition to drawing on the clinical and teaching experiences of the authors of the paper, we reviewed the literature on teaching methods, adult learning theories, and effective feedback delivery methods in medicine to draw parallels for psychosomatic medicine education.\nWe provide a review of teaching methods that have been employed to teach psychosomatic medicine over the past few decades.

In this review, cross-disciplinary data in a rapidly evolving field that bridges neurology and psychiatry are synthesized to identify shared biologic mechanisms. The relationship between these debilitating, lifelong conditions is examined at the clinical, genetic, and neurophysiologic levels in humans and in animal models. Scopus and PubMed searches were used to identify relevant literature. Clinical observations have prompted speculation about the interdependence of autism and epilepsy, but causal relationships have proved difficult to determine. Despite their heritability, the genetic basis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy has remained largely elusive until the advent of next-generation sequencing. This approach has revealed that mutations that are either causal or confer an increased disease risk are found in numerous different genes, any one of which accounts for only a small percentage of cases. Conversely, even cases with identical clinical phenotypes can be genetically heterogeneous. Candidate gene identification has facilitated the development of mouse genetic models, which in parallel with human studies have implicated shared brain regions and circuits that mediate disease expression. Diverse genetic causes of ASD and epilepsy converge on cortical interneuron circuits as one important mediator of both disorders. Cortical interneurons are among the most diverse cell types in the brain and their unique chemical and electrical coupling exert a powerful inhibitory influence on excitatory neurons via the release of the neurotransmitter, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). These multifaceted approaches have validated theories derived from the field of developmental neurobiology, which propose that the neurologic and neuropsychiatric manifestations are caused by an altered ratio of excitation to inhibition in the cortex."}, {"Title": "Neurobiology of rodent self-grooming and its value for translational neuroscience.", "Abstract": "Self-grooming is a complex innate behaviour with an evolutionarily conserved sequencing pattern and is one of the most frequently performed behavioural activities in rodents.

We suggest that rodent self-grooming may be a useful measure of repetitive behaviour in such models, and therefore of value to translational psychiatry. Assessment of rodent self-grooming may also be useful for understanding the neural circuits that are involved in complex sequential patterns of action."}, {"Title": "Primary care consultation rates among people with and without severe mental illness: a UK cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.", "Abstract": "Little is known about service utilisation by patients with severe mental illness (SMI) in UK primary care.

Engel.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this article is to examine and appreciate the contributions of George Libman Engel, MD, to psychosomatic medicine.\nEngel was a prolific researcher, medical educator, and writer who championed the biopsychosocial model, which has been widely embraced and practiced in psychiatry and medicine to this day. In the late 1970s, when Engel published his seminal article on the biopsychosocial model, the dominant model of medicine was still the biomedical model. This model considered the most important and scientifically sound aspects of patient history to be those that could be easily quantified, such as laboratory values. The biomedical model left no room for the psychosocial aspects, such as the patient's relationships and social status, to be integrated into patient care. Though many had expressed dissatisfaction with the biomedical model and suspected that it was too 1 dimensional to provide adequate patient care, Engel was among the first to propose a replacement model. Furthermore, he stipulated that there is a scientific necessity to consider psychosocial aspects of patient history to provide the most complete diagnoses and treatment plan. Along with his biopsychosocial approach to the patient, Engel also contributed heavily to research and to education of medical students. His legacy is one of compassionate, scientific doctoring."}, {"Title": "[Research in Psychopharmacology].", "Abstract": "Research in psychopharmacology began around 1950 with the description of antipsychotic effect of chlorpromazine followed shortly later with the mechanism of action of antidepressants.

Simopoulos and Cohen argue that knowledge of one's unconscious processes improves the forensic psychiatrist's capacity to manage complex forensic situations and to generate forensic formulations and opinions that are demonstrably more valid and reliable, much like competence in cultural assessment and formulation. In practice, the challenges posed by the application of these principles in forensic settings are far outweighed by the potential benefit. Forensic practice is informed by many specialties. Forensic psychiatrists do not have to complete full training in these disciplines to make use of the knowledge and perspectives they offer. The same may not be true of psychodynamic assessment and formulation. Although much can be learned from supervision, case seminars, conferences, and reading, such knowledge does little to foster awareness of one's unconscious processes that by definition operate outside awareness and thus contribute to the vitiating effect of bias. To date, the only method whereby psychiatrists can effectively come to appreciate their own unconscious processes in action is arguably through their own analysis conducted in the course of training in analysis or psychodynamic psychotherapy."}, {"Title": "Application and Utility of Psychodynamic Principles in Forensic Assessment.", "Abstract": "Effective practice of forensic psychiatry is dependent on a clinical recognition and understanding of core psychodynamic principles and theory.

This wide availability of medicinal products allows, at least in part, to address the need to identify the most appropriate treatment for the individual patient. A precondition for the effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment is the adherence, a multi-determined phenomenon that depends on factors related to the pharmacological properties of each agent and on factors independent from the therapy: among them, therapeutic alliance between patients and medical team, patient's belief in benefits and risks of medicines, and patient's relationship with the family and social environment are the most clearly recognized. The collection of data from patient helps the management of the individual clinical case, but this information could also become a source of data for research. In both cases, data must be collected in a ordered and well-coded way, therefore numerous instruments (like questionnaires and registers) are developing. This approach permits to make a recognition of patient's perception of his health condition, as well as the positive and negative outcomes of his pharmacological treatment. These tools are known in the literature by the name of PROMs (patient-reported outcome measures). From the clinical point of view, the PROMs can reduce the gap between patient and clinician in different therapeutic areas. They also enables the physician to identify the most suitable treatment to the individual patient, to meet his needs and preferences, and to adapt the therapy over time to the changes of his medical condition.

Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (also called semantic dementia) are two clinical variants of frontotemporal dementia with overlapping but distinct anatomical substrates known to cause profound changes in decision-making. We investigated whether abnormal decision-making in these syndromes could be more precisely characterized in terms of dissociable abnormalities in patients' subjective evaluations of valence (positive versus negative outcome) and of time (present versus future outcome). We presented 28 patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, 14 patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia, 25 patients with Alzheimer's disease (as disease controls), and 61 healthy older control subjects with experimental tasks assaying loss aversion and delay discounting. In general linear models controlling for age, gender, education and Mini-Mental State Examination score, patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia were less averse to losses than control subjects (P < 0.001), while patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia discounted delayed rewards more steeply than controls (P = 0.019). There was no relationship between loss aversion and delay discounting across the sample, nor in any of the subgroups.

Psychiatrists should consider anti-NMDAR encephalitis as a differential diagnosis in first-episode psychosis patients presenting with disorientation, disturbed consciousness, pronounced cognitive deficits, movement disorder, dysautonomia, or rapid deterioration, and test for specific IgG NR1 autoantibodies, even if there are no specific findings on routine neuroimaging, electroencephalography (EEG), or cerebrospinal fluid tests."}, {"Title": "Symptoms of psychosis in schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder: A comparison of African Americans and Caucasians in the Genomic Psychiatry Cohort.", "Abstract": "Several studies have reported differences between African Americans and Caucasians in relative proportion of psychotic symptoms and disorders, but whether this reflects racial bias in the assessment of psychosis is unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the distribution of psychotic symptoms and potential bias in symptoms assessed via semi-structured interview using a cohort of 3,389 African American and 5,692 Caucasian participants who were diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder. In this cohort, the diagnosis of schizophrenia was relatively more common, and the diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder-bipolar type was less relatively common, among African Americans than Caucasians. With regard to symptoms, relatively more African Americans than Caucasians endorsed hallucinations and delusions symptoms, and this pattern was striking among cases diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizoaffective-bipolar disorder. In contrast, the relative endorsement of psychotic symptoms was more similar among cases diagnosed with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder-depressed type. Differential item function analysis revealed that African Americans with mild psychosis over-endorsed \"hallucinations in any modality\" and under-endorsed \"widespread delusions\" relative to Caucasians. Other symptoms did not show evidence of racial bias. Thus, racial bias in assessment of psychotic symptoms does not appear to explain differences in the proportion of symptoms between Caucasians and African Americans. Rather, this may reflect ascertainment bias, perhaps indicative of a disparity in access to services, or differential exposure to risk factors for psychosis by race. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, {"Title": "A reply to Wang T, Shan L, Du L, Feng J, Xu Z, Staal WG, Jia F.

Since the last third of that century, we have expanded would-be disease categories to include an ever-broader variety of emotional pain, idiosyncrasy, and culturally unsettling behaviors. Psychiatry has been the residuary legatee of these developments, developments that have always been contested at the ever-shifting boundary between disease and deviance, feeling and symptom, the random and the determined, the stigmatized and the value-free. Even in our era of reductionist hopes, psychopharmaceutical practice, and corporate strategies, the legitimacy of many putative disease categories will remain contested. The use of the specific disease entity model will always be a reductionist means to achieve necessarily holistic ends, both in terms of cultural norms and the needs of suffering individuals.

These nodes correspond well to an anterior cingulo-insular (aCIN) or 'salience' network, and stand at a crossroads within the functional architecture of the brain, acting as a switch to deploy other major functional networks according to motivational demands and environmental constraints. Therefore, disruption of these 'linchpin' areas may be disproportionately disabling, even when other networks remain intact. These regions may represent promising targets for a new generation of anatomically directed brain stimulation treatments.

Age and measured variables were compared between genders with ANOVAs. Associations between attachment dimensions and affective temperaments were examined with Pearson's correlations and partial correlations; the moderation effect of age and gender on these relationships was tested with PROCESS macro. Using Fisher r-to-z transformation, we also compared our results with the findings of the previous study. Cohen's ds were used to report effect size and Cronbach's alphas were computed as indices of internal reliability.\nSignificant correlations were found between attachment dimensions and affective temperaments. Correlations were especially robust between attachment anxiety and depressive, cyclothymic and anxious temperaments.

In the etiology and course of those diseases inflammatory processes are regarded to be an increasingly important factor. They are also a frequently discussed element of the pathology of sleep. In this literature review reports on correlations between poor sleep and inflammatory responses in various psychiatric conditions are discussed. The link between schizophrenia, affective disorders and inflammatory cytokines is a complex phenomenon, which has been already confirmed in a number of studies. However, the presence of sleep deficits in those conditions, being a common symptom of depression and psychoses, can be an additional factor having a considerable impact on the immunological processes in mental illnesses. In the analyzed data, a number of studies are presented describing the role of inflammatory markers in sleep disturbances and psychopathological symptoms of affective, psychotic, neurogenerative and other disorders. Also attention is drawn to possible implications for their treatment. Efforts to use, e.g., anti-inflammatory agents in psychiatry in the context of their impact on sleep are reported. The aspect of inflammatory markers in the role of sleep deprivation as the treatment method in major depressive disorder is also discussed.

Hormones seem to play a pivotal role in creating a range of responses to meet environmental and social demands, resulting in better reactions to cope with challenges to survival and reproduction. Steroid hormones actively participate in neuroplasticity and steroids from both gonads and neurons seem to be involved in behavioral modulation in primates. Indirect evidence suggests the participation of sexual steroids in dimorphism of the stress response in common marmosets. This species is an important experimental model in psychiatry, and we found a dual profile for cortisol in the transition from juvenile to subadult, with females showing higher levels. Immature males and females at 6 and 9\u2009months of age moved alone from the family group to a new cage, over a 21-day period, expressed distinct patterns of cortisol variation with respect to range and duration of response. Additional evidence showed that at 12\u2009months of age, males and females buffered the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during chronic stress. Moreover, chronic stressed juvenile marmoset males showed better cognitive performance in working memory tests and motivation when compared to those submitted to short-term stress living in family groups. Thus, as cortisol profile seems to be sexually dimorphic before adulthood, age and sex are critical variables to consider in approaches that require immature marmosets in their experimental protocols. Moreover, available cognitive tests should be scrutinized to allow better investigation of cognitive traits in this species."}, {"Title": "Japanese version of the Munich Parasomnia Screening: translation and linguistic validation of a screening instrument for parasomnias and nocturnal behaviors.", "Abstract": "There is no broad screening instrument that can comprehensively assess parasomnias and sleep-related movement disorders listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders.

We then sought to validate these results by conducting a questionnaire study testing the theoretical knowledge and practical experience of a large number of UK psychiatrists. Finally we studied the assessment process in NHS psychiatric teams by analysing GP letters, assessments by psychiatrists, and assessment letters.\nThere was broad agreement in both the qualitative and questionnaire studies that the two diagnoses can be difficult to distinguish. The majority of psychiatrists demonstrated in survey responses a comprehensive understanding DSM-IV-TR criteria although many felt that these criteria did not necessarily assist diagnostic differentiation. This scepticism about diagnostic criteria appeared to strongly influence clinical practice in the sample of clinicians we observed. In only a minority of assessments were symptoms of mania or BPD sufficiently assessed to establish the presence or absence of each diagnosis.\nClinical diagnostic practice was not adequate to differentiate reliably BD and BPD. The absence of reliable diagnostic practice has widespread implications for patient care, service provision and the reliability of clinical case registries."}, {"Title": "[Normative-empirical determination of personnel requirements in psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy].", "Abstract": "There is a high degree of misallocated medical care for patients with somatoform disorders and patients with concomitant mental diseases.

Although school performance also has been linked with psychiatric morbidity, limited research has considered school performance as a mediating factor. To address this gap in the literature, the current register study examined whether school performance mediates the association between childhood household dysfunction (experienced between birth and age 14\u2005years) and psychiatric care utilisation in young adulthood.\nWe used a Swedish cohort of 96\u2005399 individuals born during 1987-1991. Indicators of childhood household dysfunction were familial death, parental substance abuse and psychiatric morbidity, parental somatic disease, parental criminality, parental separation/single-parent household, public assistance recipiency and residential instability. Final school grades from the 9th year of compulsory school were used to create five categories. Estimates of risk of psychiatric care utilisation (measured as inpatient, outpatient and primary care) after the age of 18\u2005years were calculated as HRs with 95% CIs. Mediation was tested with the bootstrap approach.\nCumulative exposure to childhood household dysfunction was positively associated with psychiatric care utilisation. Specifically, individuals exposed to three or more indicators with incomplete school grades had the highest risk (HR=3.7 (95% CI 3.3 to 4.1) after adjusting for demographics), compared to individuals exposed to no indicators with highest grades. School performance was found to mediate the relationship.\nOur findings suggest that future efforts to prevent or mitigate the negative effects of childhood household dysfunction on psychiatric morbidity may benefit from integration of strategies that improve school performance among vulnerable youth."}, {"Title": "Psychiatrists' Attitudes Toward Non-Pharmacologic Factors Within the Context of Antidepressant Pharmacotherapy.", "Abstract": "Recent meta-analyses of antidepressant clinical trials have suggested that up to 82\u00a0% of response can be attributed to non-medication-related factors.

Demographics, practice characteristics, beliefs about non-pharmacologic factors affecting prescribing practices, perceived response and remission rates, and opinions about the need for further investigations in the psychopharmacology process were assessed.\nOverall completion rate was 53\u00a0%. The final sample included 79 responses. The medians for clinician-perceived response rates (54\u00a0%) and remission rates (33\u00a0%) were in agreement with published rates. The reported median of the what portion of clinical outcomes is believed to be due to placebo effects (26\u00a0%) was numerically lower than suggested by literature. The contribution of the active ingredients of medications was perceived to be significantly higher than the contribution of patient characteristics and clinician characteristics. A longer time since graduation from medical school was significantly associated with higher belief in the effect of the active ingredients of antidepressant medications and with less perceived importance of placebo effects.\nThese findings suggest a discrepancy between empirical evidence and psychiatrists' beliefs on the impact of placebo effects on clinical outcomes. Educating antidepressant prescribers about the evidence based on psychosocial mediators of placebo effects' contribution to outcome may represent a promising strategy for improving clinical outcomes."}, {"Title": "Personalized medicine beyond genomics: alternative futures in big data-proteomics, environtome and the social proteome.", "Abstract": "No field in science and medicine today remains untouched by Big Data, and psychiatry is no exception. Proteomics is a Big Data technology and a next generation biomarker, supporting novel system diagnostics and therapeutics in psychiatry. Proteomics technology is, in fact, much older than genomics and dates to the 1970s, well before the launch of the international Human Genome Project. While the genome has long been framed as the master or \"elite\" executive molecule in cell biology, the proteome by contrast is humble. Yet the proteome is critical for life-it ensures the daily functioning of cells and whole organisms. In short, proteins are the blue-collar workers of biology, the down-to-earth molecules that we cannot live without. Since 2010, proteomics has found renewed meaning and international attention with the launch of the Human Proteome Project and the growing interest in Big Data technologies such as proteomics. This article presents an interdisciplinary technology foresight analysis and conceptualizes the terms \"environtome\" and \"social proteome\". We define \"environtome\" as the entire complement of elements external to the human host, from microbiome, ambient temperature and weather conditions to government innovation policies, stock market dynamics, human values, political power and social norms that collectively shape the human host spatially and temporally. The \"social proteome\" is the subset of the environtome that influences the transition of proteomics technology to innovative applications in society. The social proteome encompasses, for example, new reimbursement schemes and business innovation models for proteomics diagnostics that depart from the \"once-a-life-time\" genotypic tests and the anticipated hype attendant to context and time sensitive proteomics tests. Building on the \"nesting principle\" for governance of complex systems as discussed by Elinor Ostrom, we propose here a 3-tiered organizational architecture for Big Data science such as proteomics. The proposed nested governance structure is comprised of (a) scientists, (b) ethicists, and (c) scholars in the nascent field of \"ethics-of-ethics\", and aims to cultivate a robust social proteome for personalized medicine. Ostrom often noted that such nested governance designs offer assurance that political power embedded in innovation processes is distributed evenly and is not concentrated disproportionately in a single overbearing stakeholder or person. We agree with this assessment and conclude by underscoring the synergistic value of social and biological proteomes to realize the full potentials of proteomics science for personalized medicine in psychiatry in the present era of Big Data."}, {"Title": "Altered cognitive response to serotonin challenge as a candidate endophenotype for obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) implicates dysfunction of orbitofrontal and insula-related circuitry and of the serotonin system.

Our study is consistent with earlier research findings: a greater degree of seasonality for mania in men. It is possible that climatic and individual variables interact to determine seasonal patterns in bipolar disorder in a given setting."}, {"Title": "Criminal Responsibility of the Frontal Lobe Syndrome.", "Abstract": "Neurological and/or psychiatric symptoms might be detected due to damage of frontal lobes as detected in damages of many brain regions. Frontal lobe syndrome (FLS) occurs as a result of damage in prefrontal region due to various causes. Symptoms due to prefrontal region damage, varies according to the size and location of the lesion. In most of the cases; executive dysfunctions, attention deficits, inconsistencies in social life, impulse control problems, obsessive behaviors and violence behaviors are common clinical signs. Behavioral symptoms seen in FLS can be confused with personality disorders and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. FLS is a neuropsychiatric disorder rarely assessed in forensic psychiatry and in terms of detection of criminal responsibility. In this case report, criminal responsibility in FLS was assessed through a FLS case in which an offense of \"threat\" was committed and investigated in terms of criminal responsibility."}, {"Title": "Do shorter delays to care and mental health system renewal translate into better occupational outcome after mental disorder diagnosis in a cohort of Canadian military personnel who returned from an Afghanistan deployment?", "Abstract": "Mental disorders in military personnel result in high rates of attrition. Military organisations have strengthened their mental health systems and attempted to overcome barriers to care in order to see better outcomes. This study investigated the roles of mental health services renewal and delay to care in Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel diagnosed with mental disorders.\nAdministrative data were used to identify a retrospective cohort of 30,513 CAF personnel who deployed in support of the mission in Afghanistan. Study participants included 508 individuals with a mental disorder diagnosis identified from CAF medical records of a weighted, stratified random sample of 2014 individuals selected from the study cohort. Weighted Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association of diagnosis era and delay to care with the outcome, after controlling for a broad range of potential confounders (eg, disorder severity, comorbidity). Taylor series linearisation methods and sample design weights were applied in generating descriptive and regression analysis statistics.\nThe outcome was release from military service for medical reasons, assessed using administrative data for the 508 individuals with a mental disorder diagnosis.\n17.5% (95% CI 16.0% to 19.0%) of the cohort had a mental disorder diagnosis after an Afghanistan-related deployment, of which 21.3% (95% CI 17.2% to 25.5%) had a medical release over a median follow-up of 3.5 years. Medical release risk was elevated for individuals diagnosed before 30 April 2008 relative to those with recent diagnoses (adjusted HR (aHR)=1.77 (95% CI 1.01 to 3.11)) and for individuals with a long delay to care (>21 months after return) relative to those with intermediate delays (8-21 months, aHR 2.47=(95% CI 1.28 to 4.76)).\nMental health services renewal in the CAF was associated with a better occupational outcome for those diagnosed with mental disorders.

Pursuant to efforts toward addressing social issues at a regional and national level, it is assumed that the psychiatrist can assist individuals based on an understanding of these three perspectives. This tripartite relationship goes beyond the history of extreme reductionism in neuroscience and the aftermath resulting from the anti-psychiatry movement to provide a foundation for the development of psychiatry and a theoretical groundwork for such basic psychiatric issues as what role pharmacotherapy plays in psychiatric treatment, just why the lives of people living in the community are thought to be important to an individual's well-being, and just what constitutes recovery. Humans have come to possess highly developed brain and mental functions as a result of the adaptation to the social environment that takes place as part of the evolutionary process. While mental functions are thus dictated in large part by evolution of the brain, they also consist of important features that are not attributable to reductionist models of the brain. That is, human mental functioning forms a foundation for metacognition and sophisticated language functions, and through interactions with others and society, one's mental functioning allows for further brain transformation and development (self-regulation of mental functions). Humans develop their own brain and mental functions through mutual exchanges with others, and their dealings with other people and society form their individual modes of living in the real-world. The human brain and mental functions have evolved in such a way as to provide for a better mode of living. Accordingly, for the individual, the makeup of his or her mode of living in the real-world is the source of the well-being that serves to support that individual's values. The scientific background that the human recovery process for those suffering from mental disease involves the combined support of work, school, marriage, and childrearing stems from this fact. Humans develop their own mental capital over their life-courses and utilize it in an effort to realize their well-beings. Humans utilize mental function self-regulation based on the emotional and interpersonal functions developed during childhood in order to formulate an image of themselves (the ego) as well as the type of person they want to become (values/needs). This is indeed the true essence of adolescence. The values that drive an individual's behavior by their very nature exist in the outside world and are shared by others as well as society. These are internalized as individual characteristics through the self-regulation process of adolescence. Regardless of life stage or type of mental illness, individual reflection, verbalization, and reorganization of adolescent ego and values formation are essential to the recovery process. Humans are born with both bodies and brains, and throughout the courses of their lives, they formulate and develop values. Based on an understanding of the tripartite relationship between the brain, real-world, and life courses, it can be argued that the supporting of individual values is the scientific basis for the so-called \"patient-centered care\" and \"needs-based support\" that serve as a psychiatrist's essential capabilities. Along with the patient's recovery, which is based on this values-based psychiatry, professional growth is the privilege enjoyed by those in the psychiatric field. Beginning with a foundation based on assisted recovery at the individual level, the psychiatrist can produce mental health changes at the regional level. The psychiatrist consequently possesses the national-level vision necessary to implement a community design model that combines mental health and preventive medicine."}, {"Title": "[Knowledge of Man Returns: Some Considerations on Spirituality and Resilience].", "Abstract": "Over the last decade,\"spirituality\" and \"resilience\" have jointly become a topic in psychiatry. The aim of this paper is to discuss the future of psychiatry suggested by this topic. It may be related to what Jaspers, K. called \"Knowledge of Man (die Erkenntnis des Menschen)\". Knowledge of man in psychiatry can be learned only through clinical experince: e. g., clinical observations and case studies. Modern academic psychiatry seems to be suffering a loss of knowledge of man, which returns periodically in clinical practice. Hence, I will call the re-discovery of the topic in psychiatry as \"Return of Man\". Since WW II, there have been three eras in which psychiatrists showed deep concern regarding knowledge of man. Firstly, psychopathology and psychotherapy widely developed, when the destructive impulses of mankind were revealed in the nuclear weapons of WW II. Secondly, in the 1970's, the reforms of psychiatric services and legal systems took place somewhat successfully, when social reforms were concerns of the younger generations. Lastly, over the last decade, the topic again returned as spirituality and resilience, when scientists seemed to be powerless in the aftermath of the West Japan Earthquake. Regarding the definition of health made by the WHO in 1946, I further discuss that \"Return of Man\" in psychiatry is the necessary dynamism between negative and positive health, or between disease control and health promotion. There is an underlying dynamism between \"Knowledge of Man\" and natural sciences, which is constantly changing. So long as any theory can exist only as a part of dynamism, the Return of Man may re-surface whenever clinical theories do not fit with clinical realities."}, {"Title": "A standardized diagnostic approach and ongoing feedback improves outcome in psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.", "Abstract": "Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are episodic alterations in behavior presumed to reflect a physical manifestation of underlying psychological distress. Standardized treatment approaches for PNES care are lacking. We evaluated common approaches to PNES management that do not require significant commitment of time and resources.\nPatients with PNES established with video-EEG monitoring were randomized to one of the following three groups: 1) PNES diagnosis delivered per the discretion of the attending physician with advice to seek mental health assistance in the community (n=12), 2) scripted PNES diagnosis provided and inpatient psychiatry consult obtained (n=10), and 3) weekly follow-up phone calls made in addition to scripted diagnosis and inpatient psychiatry consultation (n=15). Reduction in event frequency measured at 8weeks following hospital discharge represented the primary outcome variable. Secondary variables analyzed included exploration of change in self-reported mood, quality of life, and healthcare utilization.\nNo significant improvements were noted in patients simply given a PNES diagnosis and advised to seek outside care on any measure. In contrast, patients receiving a scripted diagnosis and psychiatric consultation demonstrated decreased PNES frequency accompanied by improved quality of life (QOL). Patients also receiving weekly phone calls not only demonstrated decreased PNES frequency and improvements in QOL but also exhibited improved mood.\nThese findings demonstrate that providing diagnostic information regarding PNES is insufficient by itself to meaningfully affect patient outcome. Structured feedback and psychiatric consultation appeared adequate to significantly reduce PNES frequency and improve aspects of quality of life, while the addition of a weekly phone contact also led to improved mood."}, {"Title": "[A mistake in forensic psychiatric evaluation or abuse of psychiatry for non-medical purposes - a case report].", "Abstract": "In this study we attempted to visualize certain irregularities that took place in the evaluation of a patient with personality disorders performed by psychiatrist expert witness, which resulted in an incorrect diagnosis, leading to wrong ruling of the court and a referral of the patient to clinical therapy lasting six years. The psychiatric and psychological expert opinions submitted to the court and first-hand psychiatric and psychological examination of the patient were analyzed. Efforts were made to show that the failure to comply with the diagnostic criteria in the process of diagnosis and not taking into account the previously issued five forensic psychiatric opinions issued by independent and experienced teams of psychiatrist expert witnesses, as well as not taking into account the nature of the offense committed have led to a number of irregularities in the assessment of the mental state of the patient. Above mentioned shortcomings have caused unjustified legal classification of the offense and six years long detention of the patient in closed psychiatric institutions, in our regard unnecessary. The described case could be regarded as an abuse of psychiatry for the non-medical purposes and thus should have be punish. Based on the presented case it has been demonstrated that insufficient experience in forensic psychiatry and failure to comply with diagnostic criteria of psychiatrists and psychologists expert witnesses had led to a series of blatant offense of civil rights and liberties, and thus unnecessary detention of the patient for six years."}, {"Title": "From Thought to Action: How the Interplay Between Neuroscience and Phenomenology Changed Our Understanding of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.", "Abstract": "The understanding of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has evolved with the knowledge of behavior, the brain, and their relationship. Modern views of OCD as a neuropsychiatric disorder originated from early lesion studies, with more recent models incorporating detailed neuropsychological findings, such as perseveration in set-shifting tasks, and findings of altered brain structure and function, namely of orbitofrontal corticostriatal circuits and their limbic connections. Interestingly, as neurobiological models of OCD evolved from cortical and cognitive to sub-cortical and behavioral, the focus of OCD phenomenology also moved from thought control and contents to new concepts rooted in animal models of action control. Most recently, the proposed analogy between habitual action control and compulsive behavior has led to the hypothesis that individuals suffering from OCD may be predisposed to rely excessively on habitual rather than on goal-directed behavioral strategies. Alternatively, compulsions have been proposed to result either from hyper-valuation of certain actions and/or their outcomes, or from excessive uncertainty in the monitoring of action performance, both leading to perseveration in prepotent actions such as washing or checking. In short, the last decades have witnessed a formidable renovation in the pathophysiology, phenomenology, and even semantics, of OCD. Nevertheless, such progress is challenged by several caveats, not least psychopathological oversimplification and overgeneralization of animal to human extrapolations. Here we present an historical overview of the understanding of OCD, highlighting converging studies and trends in neuroscience, psychiatry and neuropsychology, and how they influenced current perspectives on the nosology and phenomenology of this disorder."}, {"Title": "Being Mad in Early Modern England.", "Abstract": "It has become almost a rule that the birth of scientific psychiatry and what we today term clinical psychology took place in the short period between the last decade of the XVIII century and the 1820s.

In this paper, however, I am providing the argument that, first, the roots of contemporary psychiatry reach at least to England of the early modern period, and that, second, it may still turn out that in the field of mental health care historical continuities are more numerous and persistent than discontinuities.

Here we investigate everyday beliefs and attitudes about depression, as well as the factors that shape the depression schemas people hold. In each of three studies, participants read about a person experiencing several symptoms of depression and answered questions about their conception of the disorder. In some cases the symptoms were presented in isolation while in other cases the symptoms were presented with a diagnostic label and/or descriptions of its possible causes (e.g., genes versus personal experience). Results indicated that beliefs and attitudes toward depression were largely shaped by individual difference factors (e.g., personal experience, political ideology) and that the experimental manipulations primarily impacted attributions of responsibility and suggestions for a course of treatment. These findings represent an important advance in our understanding of the factors that influence the folk psychiatry of depression and help inform theories of schema formation for abstract and complex domains."}, {"Title": "Causality in Psychiatry: A Hybrid Symptom Network Construct Model.", "Abstract": "Causality or etiology in psychiatry is marked by standard biomedical, reductionistic models (symptoms reflect the construct involved) that inform approaches to nosology, or classification, such as in the DSM-5 [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition; (1)]. However, network approaches to symptom interaction [i.e., symptoms are formative of the construct; e.g., (2), for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)] are being developed that speak to bottom-up processes in mental disorder, in contrast to the typical top-down psychological construct approach. The present article presents a hybrid top-down, bottom-up model of the relationship between symptoms and mental disorder, viewing symptom expression and their causal complex as a reciprocally dynamic system with multiple levels, from lower-order symptoms in interaction to higher-order constructs affecting them. The hybrid model hinges on good understanding of systems theory in which it is embedded, so that the article reviews in depth non-linear dynamical systems theory (NLDST). The article applies the concept of emergent circular causality (3) to symptom development, as well. Conclusions consider that symptoms vary over several dimensions, including: subjectivity; objectivity; conscious motivation effort; and unconscious influences, and the degree to which individual (e.g., meaning) and universal (e.g., causal) processes are involved.

Thus, we related phobic anxiety to plasma fluorescent oxidation products (FlOPs), a global oxidative stress marker.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional analysis among 1,325 women (aged 43-70 years) from the Nurses' Health Study. Phobic anxiety was measured using the Crown-Crisp Index (CCI). Adjusted least-squares mean log-transformed FlOPs were calculated across phobic categories.

The state of Victoria, Australia, has a long-running methadone program with a large number of participants. Accordingly, a growing number of adults have utilised methadone maintenance treatment for a number of years and are now moving into older age due to advances in medical treatment and harm reduction initiatives. The objective of this review is to examine the literature pertaining to co-occurring mental illness in older methadone treatment participants and to explore the future challenges this growing cohort of ageing adults pose to aged persons\u2019 psychiatry services. As part of a broader study into dual diagnosis in older adults, a search of the Scopus, ProQuest, and CINAHL journal databases was performed. Twenty abstracts from literature published within the previous 15 years (1999\u20132014) were identified that explored methadone maintenance programs and the older adults maintained on them. A number of researchers have identified the ageing methadone population to have a high degree of comorbid mental illness and psychological distress. Studies also indicate that individuals enrolled in methadone maintenance programs may engage in a degree of continual substance use, potentially leading to deleterious effects on their psychosocial function. An ageing methadone population experiencing a high degree of comorbid mental illness is likely to challenge aged persons\u2019 psychiatry services. These services are likely to be increasingly called on to manage these individuals, particularly within Victoria where few substance use services exist for those over the age of 65.

A positive association with suicide attempt was reported for younger patients, females, lower educated, smokers, those with higher scores on depressive symptoms and higher functional disability and those with anxiety comorbidity and familial history of suicidality in first- and second-degree relatives. Anxiety disorder comorbidity was the stronger predictor of current suicide risk. No associations were found with polymorphisms within COMT and BDNF genes, whereas significant associations were found with variations in rs13515 (MAPK1) and rs6740584 (CREB1) polymorphisms.

Genetic risk variants in MAPK1 and CREB1 genes might be involved in a dysregulation of inflammatory and neuroplasticity pathways and are worthy of future investigation."}, {"Title": "[For a society without secure psychiatric hospitals].", "Abstract": "The article explores the possibility of defending a society without secure psychiatric hospitals in Brazil. These hospitals have been sustained by persistent legal and psychiatric paradigms, including the notions \"safety measure\" and \"dangerousness,\" in conjunction with particular social and historical circumstances. The open repression of so-called dangerous individuals is still practiced in the name of the principle of social defense, outdated concepts notwithstanding. Together, law and psychiatry constructed spaces of power/knowledge within these workings of social control. Addressing this topic from the transdisciplinary field of social memory means identifying the struggles within particular power/knowledge arrangements, which play out in a state of ongoing tension."}, {"Title": "Telomere length in bipolar disorder and lithium response.", "Abstract": "Telomeres consist of exanucleotide tandem repeats and proteins complexes at the end of chromosome ends. Telomeres shorten at each cell division, and as such telomere length is a marker of cellular age. Accelerated telomere shortening and cell senescence have been associated with a number of chronic medical conditions, including psychiatric disorders, where increased prevalence of age-related disorders and shorter telomere length have been reported. Shorter telomeres in psychiatric patients are thought to be the consequence of allostatic load, consisting in the overactivation of allostatic systems due to chronic exposure to severe medical conditions and failure to adapt to chronic stressful stimuli. Most of the studies on telomere length in psychiatry have focused on major depressive disorder, but recent findings have shown shorter leukocyte telomere length in bipolar disorder patients and suggested that lithium may counteract telomeres shortening. These findings provided new insights into the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and the mechanism of action of lithium. In this review we will present findings from the literature on telomere length in bipolar disorder, with a specific focus on lithium. We will also discuss advances and limitations of published work as well as methodological issues and potential confounding factors that should be taken into account when designing research protocols to study telomere length."}, {"Title": "Effects of Violence Prevention Behavior on Exposure to Workplace Violence and Threats: A Follow-Up Study.", "Abstract": "This longitudinal study investigates the relationship between prevention behaviors, that is, enacted violence prevention policies, and exposure to workplace violence and threats across four different high risk work sectors: psychiatry, special schools, eldercare, and the prison and probation services. Logistic regression analysis of a 1-year follow-up sample of 3.016 employees from these four sectors shows that prevention behaviors are significantly and negatively associated with self-reported exposure to workplace violence and threats-in the prison and probation services, eldercare, and in psychiatry, while no significant associations are found for special schools. The results therefore show clear sector differences with regard to the preventive effect of violence prevention behaviors. Furthermore, this multisector comparison suggests that prevention behaviors are more effective in relation to a moderate frequency of violence and threats, and that only top management prevention behavior can prevent very frequent incidents (odds ratio [ OR] = 0.58). This study contributes to the literature by use of a longitudinal design and acceptable response rates, while also simultaneously investigating several high risk sectors. The results imply that when managing workplace violence in high risk areas of human service work, there should be emphasis on the use of violence prevention behaviors from top management, supervisor, and among coworkers. However, type of sector and the frequency of workplace violence should be analyzed to evaluate the potential impact of prevention behaviors."}, {"Title": "The Use of a Small Private Online Course to Allow Educators to Share Teaching Resources Across Diverse Sites: The Future of Psychiatric Case Conferences?", "Abstract": "The authors sought to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating small private online course (SPOC) technology with flipped classroom techniques in order to improve neuroscience education across diverse training sites.\nPost-graduate medical educators used SPOC web conferencing software and video technology to implement an integrated case conference and in-depth neuroscience discussion.\nTen psychiatry training programs from across the USA and from two international sites took part in the conference.

Each patient was assessed by means of a structured clinical interview (SCID-I) and relevant psychometric instruments including the Hamilton Depression Inventory and Eskin Suicidal Behavior Inventory.\nAmong the depressive patients, 61% fulfilled the criteria for PDD and 39% for episodic MDD. As compared with patients with episodic MDD, the PDD patients were older (d=.54), lower in educational attainment (d=.55), more likely to have comorbid generalized anxiety disorder (OR=3.7), and more prone to report symptoms of anxiety, hopelessness, pessimism, and somatic complaints. Nevertheless, the PDD patients displayed heterogeneous characteristics with respect to clinical severity and suicidal behavior.\nOur findings suggest that majority of depressive patients, including those fulfilling the criteria for MDD, have been suffering from a persistent ailment rather than an episodic disorder. Clinicians with a cross-sectional perspective are more likely to diagnose MDD, whereas those with a longitudinal perspective are more likely to identify PDD in the majority of depressive patients. The incorporation of both of these perspectives into DSM-5 in a complementary manner will possibly enhance our insight into depressive disorders and improve our treatment results."}, {"Title": "[The foundation of the German Society for Child Psychiatry and Therapeutic Education \u2013 Paul Schroeder\u2019s road to foundation chairman].", "Abstract": "The reconstruction of the evolutionary history of this professional association lays its focus on the developments which contributed to the society\u2019s formal foundation during the time of the patient killings in Germany after 1939.

These findings suggest that females experience greater dopamine (D2) receptor and serotonin (5-HT2) receptor neuronal blockade relative to age-matched males. Further, our finding provided insight to the pharmacodynamics of second-generation antipsychotics olanzapine and risperidone.\nWhen compared to male patients, female patients, suffering from schizophrenia, have D2 and 5-HT2 receptors that are blocked more readily than age-matched male schizophrenia patients.

Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) offers a promising framework for inferring the effective connectivity among brain regions and thus unraveling the neural mechanisms of both normal cognitive function and psychiatric disorders. While the benefit of such approaches depends heavily on their reliability, systematic analyses of the within-subject stability are rare. Here, we present a thorough investigation of the test-retest reliability of an fMRI paradigm for DCM analysis dedicated to unraveling intra- and interhemispheric integration among the core regions of the face perception network. First, we examined the reliability of face-specific BOLD activity in 25 healthy volunteers, who performed a face perception paradigm in two separate sessions. We found good to excellent reliability of BOLD activity within the DCM-relevant regions. Second, we assessed the stability of effective connectivity among these regions by analyzing the reliability of Bayesian model selection and model parameter estimation in DCM. Reliability was excellent for the negative free energy and good for model parameter estimation, when restricting the analysis to parameters with substantial effect sizes. Third, even when the experiment was shortened, reliability of BOLD activity and DCM results dropped only slightly as a function of the length of the experiment. This suggests that the face perception paradigm presented here provides reliable estimates for both conventional activation and effective connectivity measures.

Despite this, only about one-tenth of individuals with alcohol abuse disorders receive therapeutic intervention and specific rehabilitation. Among the various dichotomies that limit an effective approach to the problem of alcohol use disorder treatment, one of the most prominent is integrated treatment versus harm reduction. For years, these two divergent strategies have been considered to be opposite poles of different philosophies of intervention. One is bound to the search for methods that aim to lead the subject to complete abstinence; the other prioritizes a progressive decline in substance use, with maximum reduction in the damage that is correlated with curtailing that use. Reduction of alcohol intake does not require any particular setting, but does require close collaboration between the general practitioner, specialized services for addiction, alcohology services and psychiatry. In patients who reach that target, significant savings in terms of health and social costs can be achieved. Harm reduction is a desirable target, even from an economic point of view. At the present state of neuroscientific knowledge, it is possible to go one step further in the logic that led to the integration of psychosocial and pharmacological approaches, by attempting to remove the shadows of social judgment that, at present, are aiming for a course of treatment that is directed towards absolute abstention."}, {"Title": "Are suicide deaths under-reported?

The reclassification comprised an assessment of the manner and cause of death as well as the level of certainty.\nIn total, 81%, 88% and 90% of deaths registered as suicide in the official mortality statistics were confirmed by experts using the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish data sets, respectively. About 3% of deaths classified as accidents or natural deaths in the cause of death registers were reclassified as suicides. However, after a second reclassification based on additional information, 9% of the natural deaths and accidents were reclassified as suicides in the Norwegian data set, and 21% of the undetermined deaths were reclassified as suicides in the Swedish data set. In total, the levels of certainty of the experts were 87% of suicides in the Norwegian data set, 77% in the Swedish data set and 92% in Danish data set; the uncertainty was highest in poisoning suicides.\nA high percentage of reported suicides were confirmed as being suicides.

The need analysis presented here measured how many children and adolescents engaged youth welfare services before and after inpatient or daycare treatment.\nThe number of completed treatments from 36 Bavarian daycare and inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric clinics were recorded over a period of 6 months. Besides sociodemographic and diagnostic data, information was collected about indicated and subsequently realized measures of youth welfare following clinical and day care treatment.\n33 %of the clinically treated children and adolescents participated in a youth-welfare measure after psychiatric treatment. In the run-up to clinical treatment, 38 % of the treated children and adolescents had engaged services of youth welfare. Half of the children and adolescents contacted both youth welfare services as well as child and adolescent psychiatric services. The residential setting of youth care is of major importance to the cooperative treatment.\nThe provision of both youth welfare services and child and adolescent psychiatry treatment is usually not a matter of going from one system to another, but rather consists of different constellations of complex processes of mutual assistance.

Questions are typically defined in binary terms (e.g. 'open' v 'closed') that may have limited application in practice.\nTo undertake a detailed examination of the types of questions psychiatrists ask patients and explore their association with the therapeutic alliance and patient adherence.\nA coding protocol was developed to classify questions from 134 out-patient consultations, predominantly by syntactic form. Bivariate correlations with measures of patient adherence and the therapeutic alliance (psychiatrist-rated) were examined and assessed using generalised estimating equations, adjusting for patient symptoms, psychiatrist identity and amount of speech.\nPsychiatrists used only four of ten question types regularly: yes/no auxiliary questions, 'wh-' questions, declarative questions and tag questions. Only declarative questions predicted better adherence and perceptions of the therapeutic relationship. Conversely, 'wh-' questions - associated with positive symptoms - predicted poorer perceptions of the therapeutic relationship. Declarative questions were frequently used to propose an understanding of patients' experiences, in particular their emotional salience for the patient.\nA refined defining of questioning practices is necessary to improve communication in psychiatry. The use of declarative questions may enhance alliance and adherence, or index their manifestation in talk, e.g. better mutual understanding.

In this exploratory study, we used a qualitative approach to explore practitioners' experiences of this phenomenon. Fourteen practitioners providing psychological therapy within the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Service were interviewed. Qualitative content analysis was applied to the data. Four overarching categories brought up by the practitioners were identified: vagueness of the concept (reflecting that the concept was novel and hard to define), psychotherapist-client interaction (encompassing aspects of the interaction possibly related to adverse effects), consequences for the young person (including a range of emotional, behavioural and social consequences) and family effects (e.g. professional complications and decreased autonomy for the parent).

Outcome measures included the number of patients evaluated and the ED length of stay for those patients.\nOne thousand three hundred ninety-two patient visits included a psychiatry consultation for the study period. The median age was 38 years (interquartile range [IQR] 27, 49), with no difference in age between periods. The mean number of daily psychiatry consultations increased from 1.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 1.5) before closure to 4.4 (95% CI 4.1 to 4.7) afterward, with a difference in means of 3.0 visits (95% CI 2.7 to 3.3 visits). Average ED length of stay for psychiatry consultation patients was 14.1 hours (95% CI 13.1 to 15.0 hours) before closure and 21.9 hours (95% CI 20.7 to 23.2 hours) afterward, with a difference in means of 7.9 hours (95% CI 5.5 to 10.2 hours).\nThe number of visits and length of stay for patients undergoing psychiatric consultation in the ED increased significantly after a decrease in county mental health services. This phenomenon has important implications for future policy to address the challenges of caring for patients with psychiatric needs in our communities."}, {"Title": "\"Thinking too much\": A systematic review of a common idiom of distress.", "Abstract": "Idioms of distress communicate suffering via reference to shared ethnopsychologies, and better understanding of idioms of distress can contribute to effective clinical and public health communication. This systematic review is a qualitative synthesis of \"thinking too much\" idioms globally, to determine their applicability and variability across cultures. We searched eight databases and retained publications if they included empirical quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods research regarding a \"thinking too much\" idiom and were in English. In total, 138 publications from 1979 to 2014 met inclusion criteria. We examined the descriptive epidemiology, phenomenology, etiology, and course of \"thinking too much\" idioms and compared them to psychiatric constructs. \"Thinking too much\" idioms typically reference ruminative, intrusive, and anxious thoughts and result in a range of perceived complications, physical and mental illnesses, or even death. These idioms appear to have variable overlap with common psychiatric constructs, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD. However, \"thinking too much\" idioms reflect aspects of experience, distress, and social positioning not captured by psychiatric diagnoses and often show wide within-cultural variation, in addition to between-cultural differences. Taken together, these findings suggest that \"thinking too much\" should not be interpreted as a gloss for psychiatric disorder nor assumed to be a unitary symptom or syndrome within a culture. We suggest five key ways in which engagement with \"thinking too much\" idioms can improve global mental health research and interventions: it (1) incorporates a key idiom of distress into measurement and screening to improve validity of efforts at identifying those in need of services and tracking treatment outcomes; (2) facilitates exploration of ethnopsychology in order to bolster cultural appropriateness of interventions; (3) strengthens public health communication to encourage engagement in treatment; (4) reduces stigma by enhancing understanding, promoting treatment-seeking, and avoiding unintentionally contributing to stigmatization; and (5) identifies a key locally salient treatment target."}, {"Title": "Use of Telepsychiatry in Psychodynamic Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This article reviews the organization, infrastructure basics, applications, effectiveness, outreach, and implementation barriers related to telepsychiatry.

Given the growing effectiveness evidence base for therapy delivered over the Internet, telepsychiatry holds a large unexplored territory to help psychodynamically minded patients connect with psychodynamically oriented psychiatrists. This economically advantageous medium can be utilized to deliver psychodynamically guided approaches to the patient, alone or in combination with pharmacological and other psychosocial interventions.

Little is known, however, about what local health departments (LHDs) do to address the mental health needs of the populations they serve. Using data from the 2013 National Profile of Local Health Departments - a nationally representative survey of LHDs in the United States (N=505) - we characterized LHDs' engagement in eight mental health activities, factors associated with engagement, and estimated the proportion of the U.S. population residing in jurisdictions where these activities were performed. We used Handler's framework of the measurement of public health systems to select variables and examined associations between LHD characteristics and engagement in mental health activities using bivariate analyses and multilevel, multivariate logistic regression. Assessing gaps in access to mental healthcare services (39.3%) and implementing strategies to improve access to mental healthcare services (32.8%) were the most common mental health activities performed. LHDs that provided mental healthcare services were significantly more likely to perform population-based mental illness prevention activities (adjusted odds ratio: 7.1; 95% CI: 5.1, 10.0) and engage in policy/advocacy activities to address mental health (AOR: 3.9; 95% CI: 2.7, 5.6). Our study suggests that many LHDs are engaged in activities to address mental health, ranging from healthcare services to population-based interventions, and that LHDs that provide healthcare services are more likely than others to perform mental health activities. These findings have implications as LHDs reconsider their roles in the era of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and LHD accreditation."}, {"Title": "Cortical inhibitory and excitatory correlates of depression severity in children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "Neurophysiologic correlates of depression severity potentially have great utility in diagnosis and treatment planning.

A two-dimensional semantic analysis of diagnostic terms.", "Abstract": "In somatic medicine, diagnostic terms often refer to the disease processes that are the causes of patients' symptoms. The language used in some clinical textbooks and health information resources suggests that this is also sometimes assumed to be the case with diagnoses in psychiatry. However, this seems to be in tension with the ways in which psychiatric diagnoses are defined in diagnostic manuals, according to which they refer solely to clusters of symptoms. This paper explores how theories of reference in the philosophy of language can help to resolve this tension. After the evaluation of descriptive and causal theories of reference, I put forward a conceptual framework based on two-dimensional semantics that allows the causal analysis of diagnostic terms in psychiatry, while taking seriously their descriptive definitions in diagnostic manuals. While the framework is presented as a solution to a problem regarding the semantics of psychiatric diagnoses, it can also accommodate the analysis of diagnostic terms in other medical disciplines."}, {"Title": "[Epistemic and historical elucidation of the borderline personality disorder].", "Abstract": "The particularities of those that have been considered \"hard cases\" in the clinical field, and their relationship with personality disorders, are discussed together with their quintessential conceptual and diagnostic model: the borderline personalities.

Such an endeavor also requires questioning the very nature of mental illness. While trying to cope with the philosophical challenges of such a task, Peter Zachar purports to show that the nosological work in Psychiatry should not adhere to the model of natural kinds. He even considers that it is mistaken to treat mental disorders as natural kinds. Nonetheless, Zachar's view on the existence of natural kinds-even in domains where there is little room for doubting about their existence, like Chemistry-is very unstable. In 2001 he holds that there are no natural kinds, but in 2008 he argues that his objections to the model of natural kinds are more the manifestation of his skepticism against a tradition. Although the problem of the existence of natural kinds shall not be dealt with in this article, a brief description on how deflated is Zachar's view on this matter in 2008 is presented, with the central part of the article devoted to reconstruct and examine his rationale for the thesis that mental disorders are not natural kinds.

An issue related to poor prognosis in patients with chronic illness relates to the accumulation of lactate levels in blood, leading to patients that become critically ill. It is suggested that haloperidol and olanzapine, as common therapy for schizophrenia, are associated with increased levels of blood lactate, which may contribute towards the extra-pyramidal side effects.\nIn this study, 88 patients attending the psychiatry outpatient clinic of Mansoura University Hospital, under treatment with typical APs (chlorpromazine or haloperidol) or the atypical APs (risperidone, olanzapine or quetiapine) were followed over a three-month period. Blood lactate levels were assessed at diagnosis, ten days and 90 days after the start of AP treatment. Extra-pyramidal symptoms (EPSs) were studied in participants during the course of this study.\nChlorpromazine and haloperidol caused significant increases in lactate levels within the first ten days of therapy, while after 90 days, all APs showed significant increases in arterial blood lactate levels in comparison with the first baseline measurement (for all APs, p-values <0.0001). Dystonia was reported by patients on chlorpromazine, haloperidol and risperidone therapies, while Parkinsonian-like manifestations were reported with all APs tested except for quetiapine. Both dystonia and Parkinsonian-like manifestations were also observed alongside the significant increases in arterial blood lactate levels in comparison to patients on therapy not displaying EPSs.\nThese findings suggest elevated blood lactate levels may serve as early biomarkers for occurrence of extra-pyramidal symptoms in patients on chronic APs treatment."}, {"Title": "Medical Student Education in State Psychiatric Hospitals: A Survey of US State Hospitals.", "Abstract": "State hospitals may be underutilized in medical education.

Among those, contributory factors, medical specialty involved, health impact (death, disability and severity) and results of litigation (resolution, time to verdict and economic compensations) were described.\nMedical errors were involved in 25.9% of court verdicts. The cause of medical error was a diagnosis-related problem in 25.1% and surgical treatment in 22.2%, and Obstetrics-Gynecology was the most frequent involved specialty (21%). Most of them were of high severity (59.4%), one-third (32%) caused death. The average time interval between the occurrence of the error and the verdict was 7.8 years. The average indemnity payment was \u20ac239 505.24; the highest was psychiatry (\u20ac7 585 075.86) and the lowest was Emergency Medicine (\u20ac69 871.19).\nThis study indicates that in Spain medical errors are common among verdicts involving the health system, most of them causing high-severity adverse outcomes. The interval between the medical error and the verdict is excessive, and there is a wide range of economic compensation."}, {"Title": "Music therapy in patients with dementia and behavioral disturbance on an inpatient psychiatry unit: results from a pilot randomized controlled study.", "Abstract": "The prevalence of dementia continues to grow worldwide due to an aging population and is projected to affect 65.7 million people by 2030 (World Health Organization, 2012).

Consistent with national workforce statistics, Nebraska's mental health workforce is underrepresented in rural and frontier parts of the state, with 88 of Nebraska's 93 counties being designated as federal mental health professional shortage areas. Seventy-eight counties have no practicing psychiatrists. However, supply statistics alone are inadequate in understanding workforce behavior. The objective of this study was to understand mental health recruitment and retention issues from the perspectives of administrators and mental healthcare professionals in order to identify potential solutions for increasing the mental health workforce in rural communities.\nThe study used semi-structured focus groups to obtain input from administrators and mental health providers. Three separate focus groups were conducted in each of four regions in 2012 and 2013: licensed psychiatrists and licensed psychologists, licensed (independent) mental health practitioners, and administrators (including community, hospital, and private practice administrators and directors) who hire mental health practitioners. The transcripts were independently reviewed by two reviewers to identify themes.\nA total of 21 themes were identified. Participants reported that low insurance reimbursement negatively affects rural healthcare organizations' ability to attract and retain psychiatrists and continue programs. Participants also suggested that enhanced loan repayment programs would provide an incentive for mental health professionals to practice in rural areas. Longer rural residency programs were advocated to encourage psychiatrists to establish roots in a community. Establishment of rural internship programs was identified as a key factor in attracting and retaining psychologists. To increase the number of psychologists willing to provide supervision to provisionally licensed psychologists and mental health practitioners, financial reimbursement for time spent in this activity was identified as important.\nThe present study showed that a comprehensive approach is needed to address workforce shortage issues for different types of professionals. In addition, systemic issues related to reimbursement and other financial aspects must be resolved to strengthen the overall rural mental healthcare delivery system."}, {"Title": "History of the Concept of Addiction.", "Abstract": "Our distant forebears wrestled with concepts of alcohol addiction not unlike those of today: Is addiction a sin or a disease? Is addiction caused by the gods, the substance, the individual's vulnerability, or psychological or social factors? Luther, Calvin, and Catholic Church leaders viewed moderate alcohol use as God's gift; used intemperately, it was a moral transgression. The founders of modern scientific psychiatry rejected moral explanations for addiction in favor of an early biological model. The first two versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-I and DSM-II) stigmatized addiction by listing it with other societally disapproved disorders stemming from personality disorder. DSM-III espoused atheoretical, descriptive diagnoses but required tolerance or withdrawal to diagnose dependence. Substance dependence in DSM-III-R included physiological and behavioral symptoms and reflected the substance dependence syndrome. DSM-IV's emphasis on biology in its concept of dependence was unchanged from its immediate predecessors. DSM-5 declared that all drugs taken in excess have in common the direct activation of the brain reward system.

Eighty-three faculty representing 52 institutions from across the United States participated in mini-fellowship programs (2005-09) consisting of workshops and 1-year follow-up mentoring by Duke faculty. Participants attended 1-week on-campus sessions on curriculum development and teaching skills and designed and implemented a curriculum in their home institution. Participant specialties included general medicine (nearly 50%), family medicine, surgery, psychiatry, rehabilitation medicine, and emergency medicine. Pre- and postprogram self-efficacy surveys, program evaluation surveys, and 6- and 12-month progress reports on scholars' educational projects were used to assess the effect of the Duke mini-fellowship programs on participants' educational practices. Forty-four scholars (56%) completed the end-of-year self-efficacy survey and end-of-program evaluation. Self-efficacy results indicated significant gains (P < .001) in 12 items assessed at 1 week and 1 year. Scholars reported the largest average gains at 1 year in applying adult learning principles in the design of educational programs (1.72), writing measurable learning objectives (1.51), and identifying optimal instructional methods to deliver learning objectives (1.50).

Here we contrasted the effects of complex COMT haplotypes with the ValMet polymorphism on cognitive functions and their interaction with menopause, in healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia. Healthy adults (N=229) as well as patients with schizophrenia (N=172) underwent a comprehensive cognitive assessment taking into account the menopausal state. Functional COMT variations selectively modulated working memory and executive functions. Strikingly, these effects were present only in adult men but not in women before menopause, in both healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia. Importantly, the same pattern of COMT-dependent effects present in men reappeared in women after menopause. Thus, functional COMT mutations seem to modulate cognitive functions depending on the hormonal status.

However, whilst sleep disturbances have been linked to depression, this relationship has not received much attention in DLB. The present cross-sectional study addresses this by examining whether depressive symptoms are specifically associated with subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in DLB, and by examining other contributory factors.\nDLB patients (n\u2009=\u200932) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). Motor and cognitive functioning was also assessed. Pearson correlations were used to assess the relationship between GDS-15, ESS and PSQI scores.\nGDS-15 scores were positively associated with both ESS (r\u2009=\u20090.51, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and PSQI (r\u2009=\u20090.59, p\u2009<\u20090.001) scores.\nSubjective poor sleep and daytime sleepiness were associated with depressive symptoms in DLB. Given the cross-sectional nature of the present study, the directionality of this relationship cannot be determined, although this association did not appear to be mediated by sleep quality or daytime sleepiness. Nevertheless, these findings have clinical relevance; daytime sleepiness or poor sleep quality might indicate depression in DLB, and subsequent work should examine whether the treatment of depression can reduce excessive daytime sleepiness and improve sleep quality in DLB patients. Alternatively, more rigorous screening for sleep problems in DLB might assist the treatment of depression. \u00a9 2015 The Authors.

Since the Association's activities and demands reflected the concerns of the time, a depiction of the Residency Program and exploration of the historical and administrative context, in each key period, is also undertaken.\nMultiple psychiatrists from every decade, who were once active members of the Association, were interviewed and asked to describe the Residency Program at their time, with its positive and negative aspects, based on their own personal experience as a resident, but also as a member of the organization. The interviewees were also invited to share their recollections of the various Association's demands, representations, activities and functioning, depending on the issues and periods. Various private and public archives were also used, in order to contextualize the residents' experiences and the Association's work.\nA brief exploration of the historical and political context that led to the creation of the organization is explained. Training and working conditions of residents at that time are reported, enabling the understanding of the first demands when the group was born. Historical jumps are then proposed, from decades to decades, in order to depict key issues, whether they were academic, clinical or organizational, through which the Association worked, over the evolution of the Residency Program.

The first board examinations from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) took place in 2013. Geriatric Psychiatry focuses on the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of complex mental disorders in late life, a time when the interface between physical and mental health issues often adds a new level of complexity.Little has been written on the history of geriatric psychiatry in Qu\u00e9bec and in Canada. A lesser-known aspect is that from the 1970's onwards, the department of psychiatry at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (UdeM) and its network of teaching hospitals have played a pioneering role in the development of geriatric psychiatry services and training. We seek to recount the history of geriatric psychiatry at UdeM, by tracing the milestones and identifying the main actors responsible for its development, from the inception of the department of psychiatry 50 years ago. This leads us to share reflections on some of the issues geriatric psychiatry is facing in Qu\u00e9bec.\nWe interviewed several key actors, past and present, of geriatric psychiatry at UdeM. We read through relevant sources such as articles and monographs on the local history of psychiatric services, information bulletins and annual reports from hospitals and from UdeM, as well as other documentation from personal archives.\nOne of the very first geriatric psychiatry services in Canada was founded in 1978 at the Institut universitaire en sant\u00e9 mentale de Montr\u00e9al, with a dedicated inpatient unit for new admissions of elderly psychiatric patients. A geriatric psychiatry outpatient clinic was inaugurated the same year at the Pavillon Albert-Pr\u00e9vost. Throughout the years, geriatric psychiatry services were also developed in the remaining hospital sites affiliated with the department of psychiatry at the UdeM (H\u00f4pital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Centre hospitalier de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Institut universitaire de g\u00e9riatrie de Montr\u00e9al), driven by dedicated individuals, in accordance with their respective historical background and mission. Clinical training is provided in each of these sites for medical students, psychiatry residents and more recently, for future geriatric psychiatrists. In 2014, the geriatric psychiatry residency program at UdeM was the first to be accredited in Qu\u00e9bec by the RCPSC, as well as the first French language geriatric psychiatry program in North America.\nGeriatric psychiatry in 2015 is a burgeoning field, in a challenging demographic context. Despite the clinical need, major obstacles remain, particularly in the absence of specific geriatric psychiatry positions. Furthermore, the Qu\u00e9bec healthcare system is going through a major restructuration in 2015, adding to the uncertainty. The 50th anniversary of the department of psychiatry at UdeM is an opportunity to underline the contribution of UdeM to the development of geriatric psychiatry in Qu\u00e9bec, and to emphasize the specific needs of the elderly in terms of mental health care and geriatric psychiatry services."}, {"Title": "[Crossroads, 50 years of child care].", "Abstract": "Through a journey in time, we propose to revisit the birth of the first mental health care settings for children with mental disorders affiliated with Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, Canada.\nThe main centers of child psychiatry affiliated with the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al are presented with the outstanding figures of the time.\nPhilosophical transitions and therapeutic paradigms are also briefly discussed.

It was managed by the neurologists who agreed to take care of cases of psychiatry, which few doctors wanted to treat at this moment. The religious and rural society in Quebec of the 1950s got ready for the \"Revolution tranquille\". The latter finally burst after 1960. But the artistic environment was already in full excitement, and from 1948, it showed its opposition to the values which were current with the publication of the Refus global. Among the signatories of the latter, we find Bruno Cormier as medical student who will become, after 1950, a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst.

The first person to have headed was Dr.\u00a0Gerard Beaudoin\u2026 Between 1948 and 1964, several others psychiatrists were heading the D\u00e9partement without necessary bearing a particular title.The directors of the D\u00e9partement from 1951 to now were: Drs. Fernand C\u00f4t\u00e9, Camille Laurin, Gerard Beaudoin, Yvon Gauthier, Arthur Amyot, Francis Borgeat, Hugues Cormier, Sylvain Palardy, Jean H\u00e9bert, and Emmanuel Stip.When the D\u00e9partement opened, it was the second institution in Montr\u00e9al that was training psychiatrists. During the first year, there were 3 psychiatric residents, but within 20 years this number had increased to 63. From the early years, teaching psychiatry to residents, and subsequently to all UdeM medical students, has been a priority in the D\u00e9partement, and over the years many psychiatrists trained at UdeM have attained leadership positions elsewhere. The D\u00e9partement attained an early reputation for excellence in both clinical and basic research.The strengths the D\u00e9partement developed in its early years in clinical psychopharmacology, in basic research in neurotransmitters, sleep, cognition, forensic, and in community psychiatry have been augmented more recently with active programs in psychotherapy research, substance abuse research, psychoneuroendocrinology, developmental aspects of behavior, genetics, epigenetics as well as the study of the brain through a variety of brain scanning techniques.The history of the D\u00e9partement de psychiatrie de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al is largely dependent on that of each of the institutions affiliated to the Universit\u00e9: the Pavillon Albert-Pr\u00e9vost de l'H\u00f4pital du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur de Montr\u00e9al (HSCM), the Institut universitaire en sant\u00e9 mentale de Montr\u00e9al (IUSMM) and the CHU Sainte-Justine. We must also remember that the discovery of the potentiating of lithium by antidepressants was made by Dr. Demontigny team at the H\u00f4pital Louis-H. Lafontaine (now IUSMM). Significant advances related to the interaction between the psychoanalytic movement and community psychiatry were greatly influenced by the work at the Pavillon Albert-Pr\u00e9vost and the emergence of behavioral therapies (Dr. Yves Lamontagne) and cognitive studies conducted by the H\u00f4pital\u00a0Louis-H. Lafontaine. Great discoveries about sleep were performed at the H\u00f4pital du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur de Montr\u00e9al by teams gathered around Jacques-Yves Montplaisir.We also recall that two ministers from the Quebec government with important political responsibilities were members or directors of the D\u00e9partement de psychiatrie. These are Drs. Camille Laurin and Denis Lazure.The D\u00e9partement aims to strengthen clinical and basic research by contributing new knowledge that will improve care for people with mental disorders. These efforts benefit both patients and the medical students and residents being trained to care for them. The D\u00e9partement remains committed to its program, to pre-doctoral education (ensuring that all medical students at the Universit\u00e9 are trained to recognize, diagnose, and be familiar with treatment options for mental disorders), to post-doctoral education for future psychiatrists, and to the care of Quebec's patients.For over 50 years, the academic department has played a key role in attracting and recruiting excellent academic and clinical resources to staff the programs and services of our hospital partners."}, {"Title": "[From \"psychopathy\" to \"personality disorder\"--conceptual history of a problematic field within psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The issue of personality disorders addresses fundamental questions of psychiatry: Is there a clear boundary between normal behaviour and the state of mental illness?

However, there is no information so far on safety and effectiveness in patients under 18 years of age. We report on two clinical cases of adolescents with a psychotic spectrum disorder treated with PPLAI in an inpatient setting. The cases illustrate that PPLAI may hold potential as an effective and acceptably tolerated antipsychotic drug in adolescents with psychotic spectrum disorders.

An understanding of ASD's etiology and subtypes can only be as complete as the studied samples are representative.\nThe Autism Inpatient Collection (AIC) is a multi-site study enrolling children and adolescents with ASD aged 4-20\u00a0years admitted to six specialized inpatient psychiatry units. Enrollment began March, 2014, and continues at a rate of over 400 children annually. Measures characterizing adaptive and cognitive functioning, communication, externalizing behaviors, emotion regulation, psychiatric co-morbidity, self-injurious behavior, parent stress, and parent self-efficacy are collected. ASD diagnosis is confirmed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - 2 (ADOS-2) and extensive inpatient observation. Biological samples from probands and their biological parents are banked and processed for DNA extraction and creation of lymphoblastoid cell lines.\nSixty-one percent of eligible subjects were enrolled. The first 147 subjects were an average of 12.6\u00a0years old (SD 3.42, range 4-20); 26.5\u00a0% female; 74.8\u00a0% Caucasian, and 81.6\u00a0% non-Hispanic/non-Latino. Mean non-verbal intelligence quotient IQ\u2009=\u200970.9 (SD 29.16, range 30-137) and mean adaptive behavior composite score\u2009=\u200955.6 (SD 12.9, range 27-96). A majority of subjects (52.4\u00a0%) were non- or minimally verbal. The average Aberrant Behavior Checklist - Irritability Subscale score was 28.6, well above the typical threshold for clinically concerning externalizing behaviors, and 26.5\u00a0% of the sample engaged in SIB. Females had more frequent and severe SIB than males.\nPreliminary data indicate that the AIC has a rich representation of the portion of the autism spectrum that is understudied and underrepresented in extant data collections. More than half of the sample is non- or minimally verbal, over 40\u00a0% have intellectual disability, and over one quarter exhibit SIB. The AIC is a substantial new resource for study of the full autism spectrum, which will augment existing data on higher-functioning cohorts and facilitate the identification of genetic subtypes and novel treatment targets.

When unaddressed, it produces adverse outcomes. With its research primarily conducted in Caucasians, its applicability to non-Caucasians is uncertain. We explore the existence and the characteristics of pre-death grief in a multi-ethnic Asian population using an established pre-death grief scale-Marwit-Meuser Caregiver Grief Inventory (MM-CGI).\nSeventy-two dementia family caregivers were recruited from a tertiary hospital. Existence of pre-death grief was shown by its measurability on MM-CGI, together with good internal consistency reliability and construct validity. Characteristics of pre-death grief were explored through multivariate linear regression of MM-CGI and by comparing MM-CGI scores with those from the original US study using one-sample T-test.\nIn the Asian context, pre-death grief was measurable in a reliable and valid manner. Risk factors of pre-death grief included caring for patients with severe dementia, spousal relationship and secondary or below education. Influence of culture was palpable-Asians had more worries and felt isolation, and certain ethnicity showed more pre-death grief.\nPre-death grief is applicable even to the non-Caucasian population. It bears much similarity to that in Caucasians. Yet, its expression is modified by culture. Clinicians working with non-Caucasian populations need to be sensitive to its presence and to the influence of culture on its expression. \u00a9 2015 The Authors.

The goal is to effectuate a behavioural modification by modulating brain activity. The EEG NF opens new therapeutic possibilities in the fields of psychiatry and neurology. However, the development of EEG NF in clinical practice requires (i) a good level of evidence of therapeutic efficacy of this technique, (ii) a good practice guide for this technique. Firstly, this article investigates selected trials with the following criteria: study design with controlled, randomized, and open or blind protocol, primary endpoint related to the mental and brain disorders treated and assessed with standardized measurement tools, identifiable EEG neurophysiological targets, underpinned by pathophysiological relevance. Trials were found for: epilepsies, migraine, stroke, chronic insomnia, attentional-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, addictive disorders, psychotic disorders. Secondly, this article investigates the principles of neurofeedback therapy in line with learning theory. Different underlying therapeutic models are presented didactically between two continua: a continuum between implicit and explicit learning and a continuum between the biomedical model (centred on \"the disease\") and integrative biopsychosocial model of health (centred on \"the illness\"). The main relevant learning model is to link neurofeedback therapy with the field of cognitive remediation techniques. The methodological specificity of neurofeedback is to be guided by biologically relevant neurophysiological parameters. Guidelines for good clinical practice of EEG NF concerning technical issues of electrophysiology and of learning are suggested. These require validation by institutional structures for the clinical practice of EEG NF."}, {"Title": "Transformation of Mental Health Care for U.S. Soldiers and Families During the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars: Where Science and Politics Intersect.", "Abstract": "The cumulative strain of 14 years of war on service members, veterans, and their families, together with continuing global threats and the unique stresses of military service, are likely to be felt for years to come. Scientific as well as political factors have influenced how the military has addressed the mental health needs resulting from these wars. Two important differences between mental health care delivered during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and previous wars are the degree to which research has directly informed care and the consolidated management of services. The U.S. Army Medical Command implemented programmatic changes to ensure delivery of high-quality standardized mental health services, including centralized workload management; consolidation of psychiatry, psychology, psychiatric nursing, and social work services under integrated behavioral health departments; creation of satellite mental health clinics embedded within brigade work areas; incorporation of mental health providers into primary care; routine mental health screening throughout soldiers' careers; standardization of clinical outcome measures; and improved services for family members. This transformation has been accompanied by reduction in psychiatric hospitalizations and improved continuity of care. Challenges remain, however, including continued underutilization of services by those most in need, problems with treatment of substance use disorders, overuse of opioid medications, concerns with the structure of care for chronic postdeployment (including postconcussion) symptoms, and ongoing questions concerning the causes of historically high suicide rates, efficacy of resilience training initiatives, and research priorities. It is critical to ensure that remaining gaps are addressed and that knowledge gained during these wars is retained and further evolved."}, {"Title": "[Practice of Community Psychiatry for the Treatment of Depression].", "Abstract": "The practice in the psychiatric division of Kitasato University East Hospital and Kitasato University Hospital has been emphasizing community psychiatry.

Kitasato University East Hospital has 94 beds in two closed wards and is one of the hospitals designated for psychiatric emergencies in Kanagawa Prefecture. 3. Over the last 10 years aroud Sagamihara City, cooperation between psychiatric hospitals and outpatient clinics, the treatment of patients with mental and physical diseases, improvement of the quality of psychiatric practice, emergency psychiatry, and imbalances in the incomes and workloads of psychiatrists have been problematic. 4. Problems that need to be solved in practice to treat depression involve inappropriate pharmacotherapy, disease mongering (the practice of widening the diagnostic boundaries of illnesses in order to expand the markets for drug treatment), clinical skills of psychiatrists, profitability, and medical institutions which cannot cope with regular patients in an emergency. 5. Up to now, we have established a consulting service (\"Second opinion\" clinic) at Sagamihara Mental Health and Welfare Center (Municipal institution), recommended patients' consultation with family pharmacists, and increased the frequency of conferences for doctors without the support of pharmaceutical companies. 6.

The literature suggests that three law reforms have been crucial to changes in the mental health system. First, the Penal Code of 1992 redefined the provisions of criminal responsibility and introduced the category of diminished responsibility. Second, a controversial law for preventive detention (r\u00e9tention de s\u00fbret\u00ea) was enacted in 2008, according to which criminals with severe personality disorders are subject to incarceration even after the completion of their prison sentences if they are still considered to pose a danger to the public. Third, the revision of mental health laws in 2011 altered the forms of involuntary psychiatric treatments, stipulating a judge's authority to decide treatment. In parallel with these legal reforms, the psychiatric treatment system for offenders with mental disorders has been reconstructed. The number of difficult patient units (unit\u00e9s pour malades difficiles) has increased from four to ten across the nation in order to meet the needs of patients transferred from general psychiatric institutions for the reason of being unmanageable. In the penitentiary system, new facilities have been established to cope with the growing number of inmates with mental disorders. As background to these changes, it is pointed out that the current psychiatric system has undergone deinstitutionalization and become less tolerant of aggressive behavior in patients. In the broader context, public sensitivity towards severe crime, as shown by the sensation triggered by serious crimes conducted by pedophiles, seems to urge tough policies. In the 2000 s, several homicides committed by psychiatric patients had a great impact on the public, which led President Sarkozy to issue a statement calling for stronger security in psychiatric institutions. The harsh attitude of courts towards psychiatric practices is illustrated by a 2012 ruling; after a patient escaped from the hospital and hacked an elderly man to death, his psychiatrist was sentenced to a one-year suspended prison sentence for failing to recognize the danger that the patient posed to the public. Another lawsuit was raised against a psychiatrist following this case. Apparently, a sense of crisis is growing among psychiatric professionals. Their concerns are based on several points. Introduction of diminished responsibility may narrow the possibility of acquittal by reason of insanity, and lead to the criminalization of those with mental disorders. Dangerousness (dangerosit\u00e9), pivotal in the procedure of preventive detention, is not a medical concept, but is instead based on the erroneous identification of criminality and mental disorders. Therefore, it is unreasonable to entrust the evaluation of dangerousness to psychiatric expertise. Court intervention in the process of deciding appropriate treatment may intensify judicialization (judiciarisation) of psychiatry. Establishment of facilities for prisoners within the mental health system would create a new segregating function of psychiatry. Thus, French experience seems to be figuring out all the challenges that contemporary metal health is facing. Above all, effective measures should be taken to prevent patients from entering the criminal justice system. Following this recommendation would be helpful in Japan, where a new forensic mental health system has just started."}, {"Title": "Higher Frequency and Complexity of Sleep Disturbances in Dementia with Lewy Bodies as Compared to Alzheimer's Disease.", "Abstract": "Sleep disturbances (SDs) are common in patients with all forms of dementia.

Insomnia was present in 77 (34.8%), and 34 (20.7%) patients had probable REM-sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). All SDs were also significantly more frequent in patients with DLB than in AD, and DLB patients also more often had several co-occurring SDs. The presence of any SD was associated with more neuropsychiatric symptoms, higher morbidity, more parkinsonian symptoms and excessive daytime sleepiness. Antiparkinsonian medication was used more often in RBD, restless leg syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movements, and benzodiazepines were also common in RLS.\nSleep problems are more common in DLB patients compared to AD, and are associated with more clinical impairment.

Subsequently, however, GMA have been increasingly regarded as unspecific transdiagnostic phenomena or related to side effects of antipsychotic treatment. Despite possible medication confounds, within the schizophrenia spectrum GMA have been categorized into three broad categories, i.e. neurological soft signs, abnormal involuntary movements and catatonia. Schizophrenia patients show a substantial overlap across a broad range of distinct motor signs and symptoms suggesting a prominent involvement of the motor system in disease pathophysiology. There have been several attempts to increase reliability and validity in diagnosing schizophrenia based on behavior and neurobiology, yet relatively little attention has been paid to the motor domain in the past. Nevertheless, accumulating neuroscientific evidence suggests the possibility of a motor endophenotype in schizophrenia, and that GMA could represent a specific dimension within the schizophrenia-spectrum. Here, we review current neuroimaging research on GMA in schizophrenia with an emphasis on distinct and common mechanisms of brain dysfunction. Based on a dimensional approach we show that multimodal neuroimaging combined with fine-grained clinical examination can result in a comprehensive characterization of structural and functional brain changes that are presumed to underlie core GMA in schizophrenia. We discuss the possibility of a distinct motor domain, together with its implications for future research. Investigating GMA by means of multimodal neuroimaging can essentially contribute at identifying novel and biologically reliable phenotypes in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Differences among South Tyrolean suicides: a psychological autopsy study.", "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to study gender differences in the suicides in South Tyrol.\nBetween 2000 and 2009, the Department of Psychiatry of Bolzano administered questionnaires to the Provincial Departments of Public Health requesting information about causes and methods of completed suicides.

Therefore, there is a need to search for novel preclinical models for mania that could comprehensively address these limitations. Herein we review the history, validity, and caveats of currently available animal models for mania. We also review new genetic models for mania, namely knockout mice for genes involved in neurotransmission, synapse formation, and intracellular signaling pathways. Furthermore, we review recent trends in preclinical models for mania that may aid in the comprehension of mechanisms underlying the neuroprogressive and recurring nature of BD. In conclusion, the validity of animal models for mania remains limited.

Both the therapy appropriateness measured with the Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI) and the number of unsolved DRP per patient were chosen as primary outcome measures.\nDepending on their time of admission, 269 psychiatric patients that were admitted to a psychiatric university hospital were allocated in control (09/2012-03/2013) or intervention group (05/2013-12/2013). In both groups, DRP were identified by comprehensive medication reviews by clinical pharmacists at admission, during the hospital stay, and at discharge. In the intervention group, recommendations for identified DRP were compiled by the pharmacists and discussed with the therapeutic team. In the control group, recommendations were not provided except for serious or life threatening DRP. As a primary outcome measure, the changes in therapy appropriateness from admission to discharge as well as from admission to three months after discharge (follow-up) assessed with the MAI were compared between both groups. The second primary outcome was the number of unsolved DRP per patient after completing the study protocol. The DRP type, the relevance and the potential of drugs to cause DRP were also evaluated.\nThe intervention led to a reduced MAI score by 1.4 points per patient (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.8-2.0) at discharge and 1.3 points (95% CI: 0.7-1.9) at follow-up compared with controls. The number of unsolved DRP in the intervention group was 1.8 (95% CI: 1.5-2.1) less than in control.\nThe pharmaceutical medication reviews with interdisciplinary discussion of identified DRP appears to be a worthy strategy to improve medication safety in psychiatry as reflected by less unsolved DRP per patient and an enhanced appropriateness of therapy. The promising results of this trial likely warrant further research that evaluates direct clinical outcomes and health-related costs.\nDeutsches Register Klinischer Studien (DRKS), DRKS00006358."}, {"Title": "Virginia Tech as a Sentinel Event: The Role of Psychiatry in Managing Emotionally Troubled Students on College and University Campuses.", "Abstract": "This article reviews the role of psychiatry in colleges and universities, and argues that psychiatrists are significantly underutilized as consultants and educators in managing emotionally troubled students.

Subjects downloaded and used the Mindful Moods app on their personal smartphone to complete up to three survey sessions per day, during which a randomized subset of PHQ-9 symptoms of major depressive disorder were assessed on a Likert scale. The study lasted 29 or 30 days without additional follow-up. Outcome measures included adherence, measured by the percentage of completed survey sessions, and estimates of daily PHQ-9 scores collected from the smartphone app, as well as from the traditionally administered PHQ-9.\nOverall adherence was 77.78% (903/1161) and varied with time of day. PHQ-9 estimates collected from the app strongly correlated (r=.84) with traditionally administered PHQ-9 scores, but app-collected scores were 3.02 (SD 2.25) points higher on average. More subjects reported suicidal ideation using the app than they did on the traditionally administered PHQ-9.\nPatients with major depressive disorder are able to utilize an app on their personal smartphones to self-assess their symptoms of major depressive disorder with high levels of adherence.

Anemia was diagnosed in 22% of depressive disorder patients, 25% of bipolar disorder patients, and 24% of conversion disorder patients.\nThe prevalence of anemia among chronic psychiatry patients is more frequent than the general population.

Last year, because of sharp criticism the option phase of the planned Flat-rate Charges in Psychiatry and Psychosomatics (Pauschalierende Entgelte Psychiatrie und Psychosomatik, PEPP) was extended by 2 years. During this time the Federal Ministry of Health wants to look for alternatives and possible starting points for the further development of care. Now, 16 scientific professional associations and organisations have presented a joint concept for a sustainable solution: the budget-based remuneration system. The system is suitable for ensuring that people with mental disorders are treated according to their particular needs and for promoting the appropriate further development of regional care in all treatment settings. It corresponds with the objectives as formulated in Section 17d of the Hospital Finance Act (Krankenhausfinanzierungsgesetz, KHG) and translates the PEPP system, which is currently being developed and focusses on average prices, into a performance-oriented, transparent budgetary system. The fundamental principle is the separation of the individual hospitals' budgeting on the basis of evidence-based, feature- and performance-related modules and billing in the form of advance payments from the agreed budget."}, {"Title": "Endurance training in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls: differences and similarities.", "Abstract": "The aims were to examine the feasibility of and adaptations to endurance training in persons diagnosed with schizophrenia and to address the question whether the principles and beneficial effects of endurance training established in the healthy population apply also to patients with schizophrenia. In this controlled interventional study, 22 patients with schizophrenia and 22 healthy controls performed a standardized aerobic endurance training on bicycle ergometers over 12\u00a0weeks. Another group of 21 patients with schizophrenia played table soccer. Endurance capacity was measured with incremental cycle ergometry before and after the intervention and 3\u00a0months later. A specific set of outcome parameters was defined. The training stimuli can be assumed to be similar in both endurance groups. Endurance capacity improved significantly in the endurance groups, but not in the table soccer group. Patients and healthy controls showed comparable adaptations to endurance training, as assessed by physical working capacity and maximal achieved power. Differences were found in changes of performance at a lactate concentration of 3\u00a0mmol/l. Endurance training was feasible and effective in both groups. The principles and types of training that are usually applied to healthy controls need to be verified in patients with schizophrenia. Nevertheless, patients benefited from endurance training in terms of improvement of endurance capacity and reduction in the baseline deficit in comparison with healthy controls. Therefore, endurance training should be implemented in future therapy programs. These programs need to pay special attention to the differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls."}, {"Title": "Prevalence of intestinal parasites among patients of a Ghanaian psychiatry hospital.", "Abstract": "Neglected tropical diseases are of major concern to sub-Saharan African countries.

We aimed to investigate the quality and safety of discharge prescriptions written at mental health hospitals.\nThis study was undertaken on acute adult and later life inpatient units at three National Health Service (NHS) mental health trusts. Trained pharmacy teams prospectively reviewed all newly written discharge prescriptions over a 6-week period, recording the number of prescribing errors, clerical errors and errors involving lack of communication about medicines stopped during hospital admission. All prescribing errors were reviewed and validated by a multidisciplinary panel. Main outcome measures were the prevalence (95% CI) of prescribing errors, clerical errors and errors involving a lack of details about medicines stopped. Risk factors for prescribing and clerical errors were examined via logistic regression and results presented as odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 95% CI.\nOf 274 discharge prescriptions, 259 contained a total of 1456 individually prescribed items. One in five [20\u00b78% (95%CI 15\u00b79-25\u00b78%)] eligible discharge prescriptions and one in twenty [5\u00b71% (95%CI 4\u00b70-6\u00b72%)] prescribed or omitted items were affected by at least one prescribing error.

For the specific jobs, would-be doctors particularly preferred Hospital Medicine, followed by Surgery, General Practice and then Psychiatry. Would-be doctors were also more interested in careers such as Nurse, Archaeologist, Lawyer and Teacher, and less interested in careers such as Shopkeeper, Sportsperson, or Actor/dancer/singer/musician. Would-be doctors were less Neurotic, more Open to Experience, more Conscientious, and preferred higher prestige occupations. Those interested in medicine did not score more highly on Key Stage 2 attainment tests or Cognitive Abilities Test, did not have a higher family income or greater parental/carer education, and did not have more experience of illness or deaths among family and friends.\nAn interest in a medical career, unlike high prestige jobs in general, is not associated with higher educational attainment or cognitive ability, and it is likely that only one in ten of the children interested in medical careers will have sufficient educational attainment at GCSE or A-level to be able to enter medical school."}, {"Title": "Evolution of public and non-profit funding for mental health research in France between 2007 and 2011.", "Abstract": "Since 2007, actions have been undertaken in France to foster mental health research. Our objective was to assess their utility by estimating the evolution of public and non-profit funding for mental health research between 2007 and 2011, both in terms of total funding and the share of health research budgets. Public and non-profit funding was considered. Core funding from public research institutions was determined through a top-down approach by multiplying their total budget by the ratio of the number of psychiatry-related publications to the total number of publications focusing on health issues. A bottom-up method was used to estimate the amount of project-based grants and funding by non-profit organizations, which were directly contacted to obtain this information. Public and non-profit funding for mental health research increased by a factor of 3.4 between 2007 and 2011 reaching \u20ac84.8 million, while the share of health research funding allocated to mental health research nearly doubled from 2.2% to 4.1%. Public sources were the main contributors representing 94% of the total funding. Our results have important implications for policy makers, as they suggest that actions specifically aimed at prioritizing mental health research are effective in increasing research funding.

Current pharmacotherapeutic options for GAD are in some cases only modestly effective, and may elicit undesirable side effects. Through targeted actions on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathway, the South Pacific medicinal plant kava (Piper methysticum) is a non-addictive, non-hypnotic anxiolytic with the potential to treat GAD. The evidence for the efficacy of kava for treating anxiety has been affirmed through clinical trials and meta-analyses. Recent research has also served to lessen safety concerns regarding the use of kava due to hepatotoxic risk, which is reflected in a recent German court overturning the previous kava ban in that country (which may in turn influence a reinstatement by the European Union). The aim of current research is to assess the efficacy of an 'aqueous noble cultivar rootstock extract' of kava in GAD in a larger longer term study. In addition, we plan to investigate the pharmacogenomic influence of GABA transporters on response, effects of kava on gene expression, and for the first time, the neurobiological correlates of treatment response via functional and metabolic imaging.\nThis clinical trial is funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (APP1063383) and co-funded by MediHerb (Integria Healthcare (Australia) Pty. Ltd). The study is a phase III, multi-site, two-arm, 18-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study using an aqueous extract of noble kava cultivar (standardised to 240\u00a0mg of kavalactones per day) versus matching placebo in 210 currently anxious participants with diagnosed GAD who are non-medicated. The study takes place at two sites: the Centre for Human Psychopharmacology (Swinburne University of Technology), Hawthorn, Melbourne, Australia; and the Academic Discipline of Psychiatry (The University of Queensland) based at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Herston, Brisbane, Australia. Written informed consent will be obtained from each participant prior to commencement in the study. The primary outcome is the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (SIGH-A). The secondary outcomes involve a range of scales that assess affective disorder symptoms and quality of life outcomes, in addition to the study of mediating biomarkers of response (assessed via genomics and neuroimaging).\nIf this study demonstrates positive findings in support of the superiority of kava over placebo in the treatment of GAD, and also is shown to be safe, then this plant-medicine can be considered a 'first-line' therapy for GAD. Genomic and neuroimaging data may reveal clinical response patterns and provide more evidence of the neurobiological activity of the plant extract.\nClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02219880 Date: 13 August 2014:."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric and neuropsychological issues in Marfan syndrome: A critical review of the literature.", "Abstract": "The cooccurrence of Marfan syndrome and psychiatric disorders has been reported for many years.

Since the disclosure, I have met many patients and families, and learned their true thoughts and strengths that I would have never known simply through consultation, and this totally changed my perceptions of them. Meanwhile, I also received many comments from medical professionals who were also family members of patients at the same time. I learned that they were struggling with conflicting emotions of being a family member as well as a professional, and I realized the isolations of families, and persistent stigma attached to psychiatric disorders. The disclosure broadened my perspectives as a psychiatrist. Now, more than 30 years after becoming a doctor, I still question myself: 'what have I done?', 'Have I listened to the voices of patients and their families?' I still have persisted, as a psychiatrist, until today. Psychiatry is a field that can be neglected if you do not question its contradictions. I think this is also why 'patient-centered recovery' has been neglected, and, as a result, psychiatry has been left behind. I often hear people asking: 'how can we increase numbers of psychiatrists?' I did not become a psychiatrist because of my own experience. I believe that, by providing medical care that the patients and their families can appreciate, from those families, some younger members will desire to become psychiatrists ; that is the way psychiatry should be developed.

This study's objective was to describe characteristics and correlates of disability in Army and Marine Corps personnel diagnosed with psychiatric disorders other than PTSD. In this cross-sectional study, the chi-square and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests compared the distribution of demographic, disability and deployment characteristics between those evaluated for non-PTSD psychiatric disability (N = 9125) versus those evaluated for any other non-psychiatric condition (N = 78,072). Multivariate logistic regression examined associations between disability retirement and demographic and disability characteristics.

It is common to find zero-inflated (ZI) data such that a large proportion of the sample has none of the symptoms. It has been argued that standard IRT models of psychiatric disorder symptoms may be problematic due to the unipolar nature of many clinical traits. In the current article, the authors propose to address this by using a mixture model to approximate the unknown latent trait distribution in the IRT model while allowing for the presence of a non-pathological subgroup. The basic idea is that instead of assuming normality for the underlying trait, the latent trait will be allowed to follow a mixture of normals including a degenerate component that is fixed to represent a non-pathological group for whom the psychiatric symptoms simply are not relevant and hence are all expected to be zero. The authors demonstrate how the ZI mixture IRT method can be implemented in Mplus and present a simulation study comparing its performance with a standard IRT model assuming normality under different scenarios representative of psychiatric disorder symptom batteries. The model incorrectly assuming normality is shown to have biased discrimination and severity estimates.

Multifactorial processes can contribute to their development and progression. Purinergic neurotransmission and neuromodulation in the brain have attracted increasing therapeutic interest in the field of psychiatry. Purine nucleotides and nucleosides are well recognized as signaling molecules mediating cell to cell communication. The actions of ATP are mediated by ionotropic P2X and metabotropic P2Y receptor subfamilies, whilst the actions of adenosine are mediated by P1 (A1 or A2) adenosine receptors. Purinergic mechanisms and specific receptor subtypes have been shown to be linked to the regulation of many aspects of behavior and mood and to dysregulation in pathological processes of brain function. In this review the recent knowledge on the role of purinergic receptors in the two most frequent psychiatric diseases, major depression and schizophrenia, as well as on related animal models is summarized. At present the most promising data for therapeutic strategies derive from investigations of the adenosine system emphasizing a unique function of A2A receptors at neurons and astrocytes in these disorders.

A conversation analysis was undertaken to examine the interactional detail between the children, parents, and practitioners.\nThe findings indicated that claims to knowledge were managed in three ways. First, practitioners positioned children as 'experts' on their own health and this was sometimes accepted. Second, some children resisted this epistemic position, claiming not to have the relevant knowledge. Third, some children's claims to knowledge were negotiated and sometimes contested by adult parties who questioned their competence to share relevant information about their lives in accordance with the assessment agenda.\nThrough question design, the practitioner was able to position the child as holding relevant knowledge regarding their situation. The child was able to take up this position or resist it in various ways.\nThis has important implications for debates regarding children's competence to contribute to mental health interventions. Children are often treated as agents with limited knowledge, yet in the mental health assessment they are directly questioned about their own lives."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric Nursing in Integrated Wards Accommodating Both Female and Male Patients: A Historic Pioneering Reform Initiative Implemented by the Institute of Psychiatry, a Unit of the Federal University of Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this research is to analyze aspects of the sexuality of people with mental disorders, an issue that influenced nursing care in the mixed nursing wards of the Institute of Psychiatry at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro between 1996-2002. A qualitative Historical Social Study methodology used written and oral texts that were analyzed drawing on Michel Foucault's ideas about sexuality. Results of the study indicate that a rupture occurred in the distribution model according to gender at the Psychiatric Hospitalization Unit. This, in turn, influenced nursing care. From this study, we conclude that accommodating patients in mixed wards better facilitates the psychosocial rehabilitation process and changes nursing teams' conceptions about the sexuality of people with mental disorders."}, {"Title": "[Clinical Introduction of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Major Depression in Japan].", "Abstract": "Therapeutic applications of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have long been awaited for not only neurological but also psychiatric disorders as a low-invasive transcranial brain stimulation. In 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States finally approved repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for medication-resistant patients with major depression. More recently, at the beginning of 2013, a deep TMS device with the H-coil received FDA approval as the second TMS device for major depression. In Japan, it is estimated that more than 200,000 patients with medication-resistant major depression could be candidates for rTMS treatment. To promote the clinical introduction of rTMS for major depression, joint discussion has been ongoing including the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology (JSPN), the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW), and the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). On the other hand, some corporate efforts have begun to get MHLW/PMDA approval for a few types of rTMS device. In 2013, the JSPN established a new committee in order to discuss the introduction of neuromodulation methods such as rTMS in Japan. The committee has been discussing how rTMS should be introduced appropriately with expedition, considering the MHLW regulations for the expedited introduction or provisional use of advanced medical technology. Also, the MHLW has required related psychiatric societies to formulate clinical guidelines of rTMS for major depression in order to avoid any potential overuse or misuse. A number of controversies are ongoing, such as standards for the appropriate clinical application of rTMS, a suitable position of rTMS within the comprehensive treatment algorithm of major depression, and bioethical standards for brain stimulation (neuroethics). Moreover, there are some pragmatic issues. For instance, the Japanese Society of Clinical Neurophysiology (JSCN) has restricted repetitive TMS administration to medical doctors due to safety concerns. In order to disseminate rTMS in Japan, it should be discussed how to reduce the work-load of psychiatrists who administer rTMS on a daily basis. For this purpose, standards should be established by the JSCN to qualify non-MD rTMS operators under the supervision of psychiatrists. In this paper, recent progress in the clinical introduction of rTMS for major depression in Japan is reported, in order to facilitate future discussion about how rTMS should be introduced for patients with major depression in Japan."}, {"Title": "[Optical Topography as an Auxiliary Laboratory Test for Differential Diagnosis of Depressive State: Clinical Application of Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) as the First Trial for Approved Laboratory Tests in Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The lack of clinical laboratory tests is a major obstacle in the reliable diagnosis and quantitative treatment assessment and prevention of psychiatric disorders and in the development of patient-centric psychiatric practices. Optical topography has been approved as an insurance-covered auxiliary laboratory test for differential diagnosis of depressive state by Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan since 2014. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), theoretical basis of optical topography, is one of functional neuroimaging techniques that has been increasingly employed in psychology and psychiatry. Because NIRS can detect only cerebral cortex reactivities with low spatial resolution and may suffer from contaminating signals from skin and skull, its data should be interpreted as a global index of cerebral cortex reactivities. Within these limitations, the advantages of NIRS over fMRI such as complete non-invasiveness, small measurement apparatus, high time resolution, and natural examination setting lead it to one of the preferred methods in studies of brain substrates of psychiatric disorders. Two-thirds of the original articles on NIRS application in psychiatry have been published by Japanese researchers. NIRS examination of major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia using a verbal fluency task of only three minutes demonstrated diagnosis-specific characteristics of frontal lobe function. These characteristics have been established as suggesting potential diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia in clinically diagnosed major depressive disorder. In order to establish the application of NIRS as clinically useful laboratory tests in psychiatry, auxiliary nature of NIRS examination for differential diagnosis should be properly recognized both by patients and psychiatrists."}, {"Title": "Social networking sites and mental health problems in adolescents: The mediating role of cyberbullying victimization.", "Abstract": "Previous research has suggested an association between the use of social networking sites (SNSs) and mental health problems such as psychological distress, suicidal ideation and attempts in adolescents. However, little is known about the factors that might mediate these relationships. The present study examined the link between the use of social networking sites and psychological distress, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, and tested the mediating role of cyberbullying victimization on these associations in adolescents.\nThe sample consisted of a group of 11-to-20-year-old individuals (n=5126, 48% females; mean\u00b1SD age: 15.2\u00b11.9 years) who completed the mental health portion of the Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey (OSDUHS) in 2013. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to test the mediation models.\nAfter adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, subjective socioeconomic status (SES), and parental education, use of SNSs was associated with psychological distress (adjusted odds ratio, 95% confidence interval=2.03, 1.22-3.37), suicidal ideation (3.44, 1.54-7.66) and attempts (5.10, 1.45-17.88). Cyberbullying victimization was found to fully mediate the relationships between the use of SNSs with psychological distress and attempts; whereas, it partially mediated the link between the use of SNSs and suicidal ideation.\nFindings provide supporting evidence that addressing cyberbullying victimization and the use of SNSs among adolescents may help reduce the risk of mental health problems."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric Prescribers' Experiences With Doctor Shoppers.", "Abstract": "Doctor shopping is a primary method of prescription medication diversion. After opioids, benzodiazepines and stimulants are the next most common prescription medications used nonmedically. Studies have shown that patients who engage in doctor shopping find it fun, exciting, and easy to do. There is a lack of research on the prescriber's perspective on the phenomenon of doctor shopping. This study investigates the experiences of prescribers in psychiatry with patients who engage in doctor shopping. Fifteen prescribers including psychiatrists and psychiatric nurse practitioners working in outpatient psychiatry were interviewed to elicit detailed information about their experiences with patients who engage in doctor shopping. Themes found throughout the interview were that psychiatric prescribers' experience with patients who engage in doctor shopping includes (a) detecting red flags, (b) negative emotional responding, (c) addressing the patient and the problem, and (d) inconsistently implementing precautions. When red flags were detected when prescribing controlled drugs, prescribers in psychiatry experienced both their own negative emotional responses such as disappointment and resentment as well as the negative emotions of the patients such as anger and other extreme emotional responses. Psychiatric prescribers responded to patient's doctor shopping in a variety of ways such as changing their practice, discharging the patients or taking steps to not accept certain patients identified as being at risk for doctor shopping, as well as by talking to the patient and trying to offer them help. Despite experiencing doctor shopping, the prescribers inconsistently implemented precautionary measures such as checking prescription drug monitoring programs."}, {"Title": "[Identification and management of violence in psychiatry: Nurse and patient perceptions of safety and dangerousness].", "Abstract": "This paper reports the results of a study on the identification and management of violence on a psychiatric ward and in the psychiatric emergency of a Quebec hospital.

Results show that the type of setting influences the way aggressive behaviour issues are perceived and managed. The types of behaviours deemed aggressive or risky also vary between the two units. Moreover, patients and nurses are similarly described by all participants as susceptible to being violent and to being a victim of violence.

We examined an adaptation of Lab-PAB for non-standardized free-play interaction situations (Play-PAB version) with a preschool psychiatric sample. We examined the internal consistency, interrater reliability and dimensional structure of the Play-PAB and its associations to the clinical relationship assessment scale PIR-GAS from DC:0-3R. Interaction sequences of 47 parent-child dyads who were treated in our Family Day Clinic were evaluated at admission with the Play-PAB, in addition to the PIR-GAS-rating. Each instrument was rated by two independent raters. We report means, standard deviations, internal consistencies and the interrater-reliability for each of the five Play-PAB scales. Furthermore we examine if the scale intercorrelations are reasonable in comparison to the original version. Finally, the associations to PIR-GAS are presented. The Play-PAB scales reflect sufficient variation of parenting, good internal consistencies and satisfactory interrater reliability. The adaptation shows psychometric properties that are comparable to the original version. The scale intercorrelations as well as the associations to PIR-GAS are reasonable.

Faculty Perceptions of Receiving Feedback From Third-Year Clerkship Students. Amanda Kost, Heidi Combs, Sherilyn Smith, Eileen Klein, Patricia Kritek, and Lynne Robins. PHENOMENON: In addition to giving feedback to 3rd-year clerkship students, some clerkship instructors receive feedback, requested or spontaneous, from students prior to the clerkship's end. The concept of bidirectional feedback is appealing as a means of fostering a culture of respectful communication and improvement. However, little is known about how teachers perceive this feedback in practice or how it impacts the learning environment.\nWe performed 24 semistructured 30-minute interviews with 3 to 7 attending physician faculty members each in Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, Surgery, Psychiatry, and Obstetrics and Gynecology who taught in 3rd-year required clerkships during the 2012-2013 academic year. Questions probed teachers' experience with and attitudes toward receiving student feedback. Prompts were used to elicit stories and obtain participant demographics. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and entered into Dedoose for qualitative analysis. Researchers read transcripts holistically for meaning, designed a coding template, and then independently coded each transcript. A constant comparative approach and regular meetings were used to ensure consistent coding between research team members.\nParticipants ranged in age from 37 to 74, with 5 to 35 years of teaching experience. Seventy-one percent were male, and 83% identified as White. In our preliminary analysis, our informants reported a range of experience in receiving student feedback prior to the end of a clerkship, varying from no experience to having developed mechanisms to regularly request specific feedback about their programs. Most expressed openness to actively soliciting and receiving student feedback on their teaching during the clerkship although many questioned whether this process was feasible. Actual responses to receiving student feedback were mixed. Some reported having received feedback that motivated change, and others rejected the feedback they received on the grounds that it lacked validity or was inappropriate. Others expressed uncertainty about how they would react to student feedback. Faculty expressed a preference for receiving feedback about behaviors and items that were within their control. INSIGHTS: These findings suggest there is opportunity to pilot implementation of a structured student feedback mechanism, separate from teacher evaluations, in selected 3rd-year clerkships. Materials should developed to help faculty solicit, understand, and respond to student feedback and to help students frame and provide the kinds of feedback to teachers that will lead to suggested improvements. Both these endeavors have the potential to improve the clinical learning environment during 3rd-year clerkships through the cultivation of respectful communication and the encouragement of improvement in teaching efforts."}, {"Title": "Institutionally based videoconferencing.", "Abstract": "The delivery of psychiatric care via video-teleconferencing (VTC) technology is thought to have reached a tipping point. As a medical speciality with relatively few material or technical requirements for service delivery, psychiatry has been one of the earliest to embrace the possibility of providing evaluations and treatment at a distance. Such technical infrastructure as is necessary can often be found in the institutions already in existence. It was natural therefore that institutionally based telepsychiatry would lay the foundation for the development of the field. In this article we review the history and development of institutional VTC in a wide variety of clinically supervised settings such as hospitals, outpatient clinics, and forensic settings. We cite evidence supporting institutionally sponsored use and expand on key takeaways for the development and expansion of videoconferencing in these settings. We also speculate on the future direction and development of psychiatric care provided by these arrangements."}, {"Title": "Doing their best: strategies used by South African clinicians in working with psychiatric inpatients across a language barrier.", "Abstract": "South Africa has 11 official languages, but most psychiatrists can speak only English and Afrikaans and there are no formal interpreter posts in the mental healthcare system. As a result clinicians communicate with patients who have limited English language proficiency (LEP) without the use of interpreters. We present case material, constituting recordings of interactions between clinicians and LEP patients in a public psychiatric institution. The aim is to have a better understanding of how these clinical encounters operated and what communicative strategies clinicians used.\nWe used the Roter interaction analysis system (RIAS) to evaluate clinicians' conversational strategies and to analyze interactions between clinicians and patients.\nClinicians showed a high degree of tenacity in trying to engage patients in the clinical conversation, build rapport, and gather crucial diagnostic information. However, patients often responded briefly and monosyllabically, or kept quiet. In psychiatry where commonality of language cannot be assumed, it is not possible to determine the clinical significance of these responses.\nClinicians went to great lengths to understand LEP patients. It is also clear that patients were often not optimally understood. Clinicians would try to gain valid information in a polite manner, but would abandon these attempts repeatedly as it became clear that proper communication was not possible.\nOur findings suggest that in the absence of interpreter services, the communication between clinicians and LEP patients is sparse and yields limited clinical information. The lack of proper language services stands in the way of optimal clinical care and requires urgent attention."}, {"Title": "Mental health professionals' attitudes toward patients with PTSD and depression.", "Abstract": "To date, mental health professionals' attitudes toward posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), compared to other psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or depression, have rarely been studied.\nWe assessed mental health professionals' attitudes toward patients with PTSD compared to patients suffering from depression.\nCase vignettes of a patient with either PTSD or depression were presented to two samples of mental health professionals: attendees of a conference on posttraumatic stress (N=226) or of a lecture for psychiatry residents (N=112). Participants subsequently completed a questionnaire that assessed their attitude reactions to the presented case.\nParticipants showed similarly positive attitudes toward depression and PTSD. PTSD elicited a more favorable attitude with regard to prosocial reactions, estimated dependency, attributed responsibility, and interest in the case, particularly in mental health professionals specializing in psychotraumatology.

One of the strongest predictors of the future disease course is the past disease course, implying that the vulnerability for developing a specific pattern of symptoms is rather consistent over time. We therefore investigated whether BD patients with different longitudinal course types have symptom correlation networks with typical characteristics. To this end we used network analysis, a rather novel approach in the field of psychiatry.\nBased on two-year monthly life charts, 125 patients with complete 2 year data were categorized into three groups: i.e., a minimally impaired (n = 47), a predominantly depressed (n = 42) and a cycling course (n = 36). Associations between symptoms were defined as the groupwise Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between each pair of items of the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS). Weighted symptom networks and centrality measures were compared among the three groups.\nThe weighted networks significantly differed among the three groups, with manic and depressed symptoms being most strongly interconnected in the cycling group. The symptoms with top centrality that were most interconnected also differed among the course group; central symptoms in the stable group were elevated mood and increased speech, in the depressed group loss of self-esteem and psychomotor slowness, and in the cycling group concentration loss and suicidality.\nSymptom networks based on the timepoints with most severe symptoms of bipolar patients with different longitudinal course types are significantly different.

Of interest, illnesses such as major depressive disorder are disproportionately prevalent in patients with gastrointestinal illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease, which pathologically has been strongly linked to microbiome function. Not only is the microbiome associated with the disease itself, but it may also influence the effectiveness or adverse effects associated with pharmacologic agents used to treat these disorders.

Evidence based treatment and knowledge on the efficiency of the treatment for this complex patient group is therefore scarce. This leads to uncertainty as to which treatment should be offered and potentially lowers the quality of life for the patients. Chronic pain is very common among traumatised refugees and it is believed to maintain the mental symptoms of trauma. Hence, treating chronic pain is believed to be of high clinical value for this patient group. In clinical studies, physical activity has shown a positive effect on psychiatric illnesses such as depression and anxiety and for patients with chronic pain. However, scientific knowledge about physical activity as part of the treatment for traumatised refugees is very limited and no guidelines exist on this topic.\nThis study will include approximately 310 patients, randomised into three groups. All three groups receive psychiatric treatment as usual for the duration of 6-7 months, consisting of consultations with a medical doctor including pharmacological treatment and manual-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. The first group only receives treatment as usual while the second and the third groups receive either Basic-Body Awareness Therapy or mixed physical activity as add-on treatments.

Because it is a new entity, treatment guidelines, as well as its sociodemographic and clinical features among diverse populations, are still not elucidated. Here, DMDD cases from three centers in Turkey are reported and the implications are discussed.\nThe study was conducted at the Abant Izzet Baysal University Medical Faculty Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (Bolu), and American Hospital and Bengi Semerci Institute (Istanbul) between August 2014 and October 2014. Records of patients were reviewed and features of patients who fulfilled criteria for DMDD were recorded. Data were analyzed with SPS Version 17.0 for Windows. Descriptive analyses, \u03c7(2) test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used for analyses. Diagnostic consensus was determined via Cohen's \u03ba constants. p was set at 0.01.\nThirty-six patients (77.8 % male) fulfilled criteria for DMDD. \u03ba value for consensus between clinicians was 0.68 (p\u2009=\u20090.00).

Irritability, temper tantrums, verbal rages, and physical aggression toward family members were the most common presenting complaints.\nDiagnostic consensus could not be reached for almost one fourth of cases. Most common reasons for lack of consensus were problems in clarification of moods of patients in between episodes, problems in differentiation of normality and pathology (i.e., symptoms mainly reported in one setting vs. pervasiveness), and inability to fulfill frequency criterion for tantrums."}, {"Title": "Characterization of Older Emergency Department Patients Admitted to Psychiatric Units.", "Abstract": "Many older patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with psychiatric complaints require admission to geropsychiatric units (GPUs). The medical evaluation needed prior to this is not understood. Our goal was to understand ED evaluation practices for patients admitted to the GPU through the ED and understand the medical problems identified after admission.\nVia retrospective chart review, we abstracted demographics, medical history, ED complaint, evaluation, length of stay, and diagnosis. The number of patients later transferred from the GPU and the reasons for such transfers were also recorded.\nOf 100 patients reviewed, the average age was 78 years. Admission diagnoses were agitation/mania (30%), depression/suicidal ideation (28%), change in mental status/confusion (12%) and other (30%). Most had at least one prior psychiatric and medical diagnosis (77%, 60%). Common ED tests ordered were basic metabolic panel (BMP) (96%), complete blood count (CBC) (94%), urinalysis (UA) (89%), electrocardiogram (EKG) (69%), alcohol level (62%), urine toxicology (61%), chest X-ray (51%), and CT scan of the head (71%). Abnormal findings included urinalysis (24.7%), CBC (23.4%), toxicology (23%), BMP (21.9%), head CT (21.1%), chest X-ray (13.7%), ECG changes (10.1%), and alcohol (4.8%). Five of the 100 GPU admissions were later transferred to a medical floor.\nMost GPU admissions have previous psychiatric and medical issues and are admitted for agitation/mania or depression/suicidal ideation. A certain percentage of patients are transferred out due to medical issues despite ED evaluation. However, it is unlikely that further ED testing would reduce this percentage.

Depressiveness was screened with GDS-15 (Geriatric Depression Scale), and the results were classified into three outcome categories: non-depression (ND), SSD and syndromal depression. Data were analysed with binary logistic, ordinal logistic and linear regression.\nWith univariate logistic regression 20 factors associated with SSD were identified in very old persons, and the four hypothesized domains--sociodemographic factors, declining physical functioning, neuropsychiatric factors and existential factors--significantly related to SSD. The multivariate logistic model included seven independent factors that increase the likelihood of SSD instead of ND (lower self-perceived health, life not meaningful, problems with self-care, use of tranquilizing medication, no contact with neighbours, history of affective disorder and history of stroke). The ordinal logistic and the linear regression models resulted in seven partly different factors for predicting SSD and depressiveness, in the very old.\nThe identified markers may help clinicians with the detection, prevention and treatment of SSD in very old persons. The findings indicate the importance of a comprehensive functional approach to diagnosing and treating depressiveness in this population, and the findings might be interpreted as offering support for the coexistence of a dimensional and a categorical view on depressive disorders."}, {"Title": "The association between self-image and defence mechanisms in a group of adolescent patients receiving psychiatric treatment.", "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to explore the relationship between various areas of self-image and defence mechanisms in adolescents.

The presence of numerous somatic complications as a consequence of starvation is an important part of the clinical picture of this disease. Symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract are one of the most common complaints reported by patients, especially in the initial period of realimentation. Most common symptoms are associated with gastrointestinal motility disorders. The available data show that as many as half of patients suffering from anorexia nervosa manifest significant gastrointestinal motility disorders (incomplete relaxation of the upper and lower oesophageal sphincter, impaired compliance of the stomach, delayed gastric emptying, intestinal transit extension, decreased motility of the rectum and anus). These disorders along with gastrointestinal tract ailments may impede the restoration of proper diet, if not detected early and treated. There are relatively few studies on gastrointestinal motility disorders in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa, which do not clearly answer the question whether these disorders are genetic, or result from cachexia and whether they disappear along with the restoration of the normal body weight.

Ancient Epicurean and Stoic philosophers suggested techniques to reach an anxiety-free state of mind that are reminiscent of modern cognitive psychology. Between classical antiquity and the late 19(th) century there was a long interval during which anxiety was not classified as a separate illness. However, typical cases of anxiety disorders kept being reported, even if under different names. In the 17(th) century, Robert Burton described anxiety in The Anatomy of Melancholy. Panic attacks and generalized anxiety disorder may be recognized in the \"panophobias\" in the nosology published by Boissier de Sauvages in the 18(th) century. Also, anxiety symptoms were an important component of new disease constructs, culminating in neurasthenia in the 19(th) century. Emil Kraepelin devoted much attention to the possible presence of severe anxiety in manic-depressive illness, thereby anticipating the \"anxious distress\" specifier of bipolar disorders in DSM-5.

Typically, these studies report results from a small range of cut-off points around whatever cut-off score is identified as most accurate. When published data are combined in meta-analyses, estimates of accuracy for different cut-off points may be based on data from different studies, rather than data from all studies for each cut-off point. Thus, traditional meta-analyses may exaggerate accuracy estimates. Individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses synthesise data from all studies for each cut-off score to obtain accuracy estimates. The 10-item Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is commonly recommended for depression screening in the perinatal period. The primary objective of this IPD meta-analysis is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the EPDS to detect major depression among women during pregnancy and in the postpartum period across all potentially relevant cut-off scores, accounting for patient factors that may influence accuracy (age, pregnancy vs postpartum).\nData sources will include Medline, Medline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, PsycINFO, and Web of Science.

Hungary's prevalence of vascular dementia is much higher than that of other countries. Patients with dementia can be admitted to psychiatric hospitals for several reasons, the least common of which is cognitive decline. Comorbid psychiatric disorders or dementia-related behavioral disturbances are much more common reasons.\nTo examine the reasons for the acute psychiatric admission of patients suffering from dementia in a psychiatric center in Budapest.\nIn this retrospective survey the data of dementia patients who were referred to the Centre for Psychiatry and Addiction Medicine (CPAM) at Szent Istv\u00e1n and Szent L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Hospitals between August 1 and October 31, 2014 were analyzed with special attention paid to the reasons for hospitalization.\nAltogether 302 patients were admitted to the CPAM over the study period and 26.15% of them suffered from dementia. The distribution of dementia subtypes was as follows: 43% mixed type (vascular and neurodegenerative), 40.5% vascular type, 11.4% Alzheimer's disease, and 5.1% other types. A small percentage (12.7%) of patients had mild dementia, while 34.2% and 53.2% suffered from moderate and severe dementia, respectively. The major causes of hospitalization were aggressive behavior (34.2%), delirium (19%), and divagation and confusion 15.2% each. They were mainly associated with moderate and severe dementia. Suicide attempt was the reason for admission in 10.1% of cases, and delusions in 6.3%. With regard to admission outcome, 44.3% of patients were transferred to a medical ward, 12% within 3 days of psychiatric admission. Nearly 9% of patients required extended hospitalization, 21.5% were discharged home, 20.3% were transferred to a nursing home and 5.1% died while in hospital. More than half of the patients were rated on the CGI-C scale; 59% of them scored 2 points (much improved), 25% scored 1 point (very much improved) and 16% scored 3 points (moderate improvement).\nA high proportion of dementia patients acutely admitted to a psychiatric ward was medically compromised and either died soon after admission (5%) or was transferred to a medical ward for further treatment. This highlights the importance of a thorough medical work-up including physical examination and laboratory investigations for dementia patients requiring acute psychiatric admission.

We argue that a psychiatry informed by computational neuroscience, computational psychiatry, can obviate this danger. Through a focus on the reasoning processes by which humans attempt to maximize reward (and minimize punishment), and how such reasoning is expressed neurally, computational psychiatry can render obsolete the polarity between biological and psychosocial conceptions of illness.

We reflect on the implications of this perspective for a definition of mental disorder, including what is entailed in asserting that a particular disorder is 'biological' or 'psychological' in origin.

We examine whether course of anxiety disorders (ANX), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), disruptive behavior disorders (DBD), and substance use disorders (SUD) influence likelihood of recovery and recurrence of depression and mania in BP youth.\nWeekly ratings of psychiatric disorder intensity were obtained from 413 participants of the Course and Outcome of BP Youth project, followed for an average of 7.75 years. Multiple-event Cox proportional hazards regression analyses examined worsening of comorbid disorders as predictors of mood episode recovery and recurrence.\nIncreased severity in ANX and SUD predicted longer time to recovery and less time to next depressive episode, and less time to next manic episode. Multivariate models with ANX and SUD found that significant effects of ANX remained, but SUD only predicted longer time to depression recovery. Increased severity of ADHD and DBD predicted shorter time to recurrence for depressive and manic episodes.\nThere are significant time-varying relationships between the course of comorbid disorders and episodicity of depression and mania in BP youth.

To address this issue, we investigated the ability of these indoleamines to mitigate the behavioral phenotypes associated with NMDA-receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction in mice. We demonstrated that exogenous MLT and NAS treatments attenuated the NMDAR antagonist (ketamine) induced immobility in the forced swim test (FST) but not the classical striatum-related hyperlocomotor activity phenotype. The MLT/NAS-mediated protection of the phenotype in FST could be correlated to the ability of these indoleamines to counteract the deleterious effects of chronic ketamine on pro-survival molecular events by restoring the activities in MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways in the hippocampus. MLT seems to modulate these pathways by promoting accumulation of the mature form of BDNF above the control (vehicle-treated) levels, perhaps via MLT receptor-dependent mechanisms and in the process overcoming the ketamine-induced down-regulation of BDNF. In contrast, NAS appears to partly restore the ketamine-induced decrease of BDNF to the control levels. In spite of this fundamental difference in modulating BDNF levels in the upstream events, both MLT and NAS seem to overlap in the TrkB-induced downstream pro-survival mechanisms in the hippocampus, providing protection against NMDAR-hypofunction related cellular events. Perhaps, this also signifies the physiological importance of robust MLT synthesizing machinery that converts serotonin to MLT, in ensuring positive impact on hippocampus-related symptoms in psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Electronic gaming machines and gambling disorder: A cross-cultural comparison between treatment-seeking subjects from Brazil and the United States.", "Abstract": "The objective of this paper is to perform a cross-cultural comparison of gambling disorder (GD) due to electronic gaming machines (EGM), a form of gambling that may have a high addictive potential.

The programme focuses on training non-physician health professionals in mental health speciality. One of the courses in the training programme, child psychiatry, involves a child psychiatrist and a children's nurse supporting the management of a patient described in this case report. Its conceptual framework is based on the section \"significant emotional and medically unexplained complaints\" of the \"WHO mental health GAP intervention guide for mental, neurological and substance use disorders in non-specialized health settings\".\nThe purpose of this case report is to promote confidence in mental health professionals when managing patients with similar conditions, and to stimulate further evaluation of the conceptual approach in developing countries.\nThe subject of this case report is a 14-year-old adolescent girl admitted to the psychiatric clinic at Jimma University Teaching Hospital. She was admitted for intractable retching, inability to eat, weight loss, and inability to walk. Challenges included the combination of medical and psychiatric symptoms, and the significant impairment of functioning in this adolescent. The first aim in the management of this patient was to guarantee vital functions. In a problem-oriented approach, different domains were addressed to restore nutritional, social, emotional, and motor functions. Treatment consisted of various elements of psychosocial interventions.

The psychiatric expert is commissioned to determine whether or not the accused has a mental disorder and to specify whether or not it affected discernment at the time of offense. Nowadays, psychiatric expertise is coming under more and more criticism, particularly regarding divergences between experts.\nOur objectives were to find points of divergence between experts, try to understand causes and suggest ways to try to reduce them.\nFor this we conducted a study, between July 2012\u00a0and January 2013, with psychiatric experts of the Court of Appeal of Aix-en-Provence through semi-structured interviews. We focused on a limited context: psychiatric expertise of responsibility for schizophrenic persons accused of murder. We questioned the experts about the issue of criminal liability of a person with schizophrenia in general but also in clinical situations we thought particularly involved in disagreements.\nWe recruited a population of 17\u00a0psychiatrists, mostly males of average age of 58\u00a0years, working mostly in the department of adult psychiatry of a hospital. We highlighted the differences between the experts, first with regards to the issue of liability in general. Experts divided seemed to keep in majority (52.9\u00a0%) the alternative between abolition and alteration of discernment when faced with a schizophrenic person accused of murder. The differences were even more pronounced in specific contexts. Thus, the fact that the person had suffered from delirium at the time of the offense led half of the experts (47.1\u00a0%) to conclude a systematic abolition of discernment, while the other half made such a conclusion when the delirium was directly linked to the facts. Discontinuation of neuroleptic treatment, drug abuse or existence of premeditation changed the conclusions of the experts in half the cases, more in the sense of an increased accountability in the cases of drug abuse or premeditation, and in the direction of a reduction of liability in case of cessation of treatment. The denial of facts by the accused caused fewer disagreements between experts. Among experts, 76.5\u00a0% had already observed differences, which, according to them, were based primarily on schools of thought, or personal views (64.7\u00a0%), which could distort clinical evaluation and especially forensic interpretation of the relationship between pathology and facts. The experts thought it was possible and desirable to reduce differences and proposed different solutions for this, especially the return to dual expertise and colleges of experts.\nOur results were consistent with those in the literature. Based on proposals from experts and data from the literature, we identified five perspectives likely to reduce differences: first it would be useful to put in place a better specific training in forensic psychiatry and expertise, not only theoretical but also in terms of practical training through tutoring. We would identify a jurisprudence in forensic psychiatric assessment and identify consensual points. It would be good to allow experts to acquire sufficient experience not just through tutorials but also by statutory changes. Moments of exchange between experts -\u00a0including a return to dual expertise and the organization of work meeting\u00a0- could also reduce differences. Finally, we propose legislative changes: not only to rewrite the paragraph 2\u00a0of Article 122-1\u00a0of the French Penal Code, but also to give priority to the expertise of responsibility on the expertise of dangerousness.\nWe showed that there were differences between the experts mainly concerned with the forensic interpretation, and that they seemed linked to schools of thought or to personal views of each expert.

Since both epilepsy and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can induce decreased libido, sexual health assessment is an important aspect of quality care in PWE as well as other patients receiving AEDs. This paper presents findings from a pilot quality initiative conducted in the ambulatory care epilepsy, pain management, and psychiatric services (N=15 clinicians) which addressed two themes: 1) whether libido is routinely questioned with/without the electronic medical record (EMR) and 2) clinicians' knowledge that both epilepsy and AEDs can induce decreased libido. All clinicians used the EMR, 40% used the GU-ROS section, but only 1 clinician (6.67%) questioned patients regarding libido. Of the clinicians, 26.7% demonstrated knowledge that both AEDs and epilepsy can cause decreased libido.

It also represents a challenge to mainstream human rights movements and mechanisms who have long paid insufficient attention to human rights of persons with (psychosocial) disabilities. It is increasingly understood that human rights of persons with psychosocial disabilities (mental health problems) should not be seen in the narrow perspective, as if the only issue was the most controversial one, that is, deprivation of liberty.

Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 2 (MCHR2) is a central receptor involved in energy homeostasis. MCHR2 shares its promoter region with MCHR2-AS1, a long antisense non-coding RNA. The aim of this study was to determine whether tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of MCHR2 and MCHR2-AS1 are associated with the body mass index (BMI) in the psychiatric and in the general population. The influence of MCHR2 and MCHR2-AS1 tSNPs on BMI was firstly investigated in a discovery psychiatric sample (n1 = 474). Positive results were tested for replication in two other psychiatric samples (n2 = 164, n3 = 178) and in two population-based samples (CoLaus, n4 = 5409; GIANT, n5 = 113809). In the discovery sample, TT carriers of rs7754794C>T had 1.08 kg/m2 (p = 0.04) lower BMI as compared to C-allele carriers. This observation was replicated in an independent psychiatric sample (-2.18 kg/m2; p = 0.009).

In universities, for example, there is longitudinal evidence that research-focused scholars make the best leaders; results from a hospital study show that doctors instead of professional managers are most closely associated with the best performing institutions. To explain these patterns, and raise hypotheses, a theory of expert leadership (TEL) has been developed that might explain these patterns. In this paper the framework for expert leadership is applied to psychiatry.\nThe TEL proposes that psychiatric leaders, as opposed to non-expert managers, improve organizational performance through several channels. First, experts' knowledge influences organizational strategy. Second, having been 'one of them', a psychiatrist understands how to create the optimal work environment for psychiatric teams, through appropriate goal-setting, evaluation and support. These factors are positively associated with workers' wellbeing and performance. Third, exceptional psychiatrist-leaders are likely to set high standards for hiring. Fourth, leaders' credibility extends their influence among core workers, and also signals organizational priorities to stakeholders. Finally, a necessary prerequisite of TEL is that expert leaders have direct executive power inclusive of budgetary and strategic oversight."}, {"Title": "[Patient education in psychiatry: Representations of caregivers, patients and their families].", "Abstract": "Why do caregivers working in psychiatry seem to wonder about their practices, in front of the recent mediatisation of patient education in France? Do our educational practices meet the needs and the expectations of patients and their families? These questions led us to carry out this qualitative and prospective study concerning the representations of patient education of the main actors in psychiatry.\nThis work aims to assess the representations of patient education of the main actors in psychiatry, in particular to assess convergences and divergences.\nThis is a qualitative and prospective study. Qualitative data are speeches from caregivers working in psychiatry, patients suffering from a psychiatric pathology and their families. The three populations studied were defined by precise characteristics. The sample was diversified by a variable related to the study theme: experience or not in patient education. Speeches were collected during interviews, which were carried out by the same person. Interviews were semi-structured by a thematic guide, which defined the themes to be explored. The three main themes are: the concept of patient education, the objectives of patient education, and the caregiver/patient relationship. We analysed the content of the speeches with a lexical reference table that we elaborated from the literature of experts in patient education. We also realised a transverse analysis in order to assess convergences and divergences between the different speeches.\nThirty-two interviews were realised with fifteen caregivers (six psychiatrists and nine nurses), ten patients and seven families. In the speeches of the different populations, we found the expected element of language for all the themes explored. Unexpected ideas were also found in the speeches of the various groups. We could find convergences and divergences concerning these unexpected ideas between and within each group. Regarding convergences, all the groups mentioned the unexpected idea of the problem of social representations of psychiatric diseases. The three groups also approached the need to develop the work with families. Patients and families entrusted their feeling that there would be a lack of exchange with some caregivers. Patients and caregivers evoked the paternalistic attitude of some caregivers. Finally, both caregivers and family approached their questions regarding the caregiver/patient relationship during care without the patient's consent. We found several divergences in the caregivers' speeches. These divergences seemed to be correlated with the experience in patient education in psychiatry. They concerned the scope of patient education in psychiatry, the differences perceived between patient education in psychiatry or in somatic cares, and the diagnostic announcement to the patient. This last unexpected idea was the main point of divergence between caregivers and patients.\nResults of this study showed that the representations of caregivers, patients and their families correlate with the experts' ideas regarding patient education. The analysis of the different speeches highlighted several unexpected ideas, which constitute themes of reflection about patient education. Some of these themes concern in particular the medical domain of psychiatry such as the questions about caregiver/patient relationship during care without the patient's consent and restraint. Another theme of psychiatry specific reflection is the differences perceived by some caregivers between their practices and the patient education in somatic care. Others themes of reflection highlighted all the medical specialities: the need to develop the work with families, the problem of the social representations of diseases, the scopes of patient education and the diagnostic announcement to the patient.\nThis study highlighted several themes of reflection about patient education in psychiatry. We should include this theme of reflection in our practices in order to respond more precisely to the needs and the expectations of the patients and their families."}, {"Title": "Professionalism Mini-Evaluation Exercise in Finland: A preliminary investigation introducing the Finnish version of the P-MEX instrument.", "Abstract": "Teaching medical professionalism is increasingly acknowledged as an important aspect of medical education. The Professionalism Mini-Evaluation Exercise (P-MEX) is an assessment tool for evaluating medical professionalism, but no studies using it as a self-assessment instrument have been reported. This paper reports on a preliminary investigation of the Finnish version of the P-MEX instrument as an assessment and self-assessment measure.\nThe sample in the present cross-sectional study comprised all 23 medical students and recent graduates (15 females and 8 males) participating in a summer school of psychiatry program in 2014. The two-month program combines clinical work with multifaceted teaching and intensive tutoring. At the end of the program, the participants' medical professionalism was assessed by the tutors and other members of the work community as well as the students themselves using the Finnish version of the P-MEX instrument. The P-MEX scores were compared, using the Friedman test.\nThe mean values and SD for the P-MEX assessments were as follows: tutor assessment 3.26\u00b10.21, work community assessment 3.32\u00b10.26 and self-assessment 3.01\u00b10.07. No significant gender differences were observed. The tutor and work community assessments were significantly correlated (r=0.573, p=0.040), but the self-assessment scores did not correlate with either of the other assessments. Overall, the students evaluated their skills significantly poorer in comparison to the other assessments.\nAlthough the small sample size limits the generalization of these preliminary results, the Finnish version of the P-MEX instrument appears to be a feasible measure of medical professionalism. The instrument can also be used as a self-assessment instrument, but subjective evaluations should be complemented with external assessments or feedback in order to take individual and cultural aspects into account."}, {"Title": "Teaching Lifelong Research Skills in Residency: Implementation and Outcome of a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Course.", "Abstract": "There is rising concern that fundamental scientific principles critical to lifelong learning and scientific literacy are not sufficiently addressed during residency.\nWe describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a systematic review and meta-analysis course designed to improve residents' research literacy.\nWe developed and implemented a novel, interactive, web-enhanced course for third-year psychiatry residents to provide the theoretical and methodological tools for conducting and reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The course is based on Bloom's learning model, and established criteria for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Eight sequential learning objectives were linked to 8 well-specified assignments, with the objectives designed to build on one another and lead to the creation of a scientific manuscript.\nFrom 2010-2014, 54 third-year psychiatry residents (19 unique groups) successfully completed the course as part of a graduation requirement.

The objective of this study is to determine if treatment with positive airway pressure (PAP) improves symptoms of depression and anxiety. A systematic review was conducted to identify clinical trials of PAP that contained a validated measure of depression severity. Meta-analysis was conducted for depression, anxiety, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), quality of life (QoL) and respiratory variables. The systematic review included 33 reports. Pre-post-test analysis of PAP showed a moderate effect size (Hedge's g, 95% CI) for depression 0.524 [0.401-0.647], but a low effect size compared to oral placebo (0.355 [0.187-0.524]) and no effect when compared to dental appliances (0.107 [-0.72-0.287]) and sham PAP (-0.049 [-0.292-0.194]). Anxiety, EDS, and QoL showed similar improvement in pre-post-test analysis, but a lack of superiority to dental appliances and sham PAP. PAP was superior to all comparators for respiratory variables. PAP has a moderate clinical effect on symptoms of depression and anxiety in OSA, but it is not superior to dental appliances or sham PAP. The improvement in subjective symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, may be mediated by patient expectations and contact with healthcare providers."}, {"Title": "Moving Out of the Office: Removing Barriers to Access to Psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "Our paper offers a perspective on barriers to access to psychiatric care. Research shows that access depends not simply on the total number of trained specialists but also on their kind of practice. In some large cities, some practitioners follow a small number of patients in long-term psychotherapy, a practice supported by government insurance, which places no limits on the number of sessions or treatment duration. The problem is that long-term psychotherapy, despite a rich tradition in psychiatry, is not an evidence-based treatment.

This theme is divided into three subthemes: to use and attitudes toward use, to trivialise use and risks of use, and to disclaim responsibility for use and misuse. The second theme, to explain use and misuse involved reasons for the use and misuse of alcohol and psychotropic drugs. It included the subthemes: to be afraid, to be lonely, and to be informed.\nThe study revealed that most informants had experiences with the use of alcohol and psychotropic drugs, but disclaimed any challenges with their use. The use was trivialised and seen as something older people just do.

We previously developed the 48-item Symptom Questionnaire (SQ-48) as a public domain self-report psychological distress instrument and showed good internal consistency as well as good convergent and divergent validity among clinical and non-clinical samples. The present study, conducted among psychiatric outpatients in a routine clinical setting, describes additional psychometric properties of the SQ-48. The primary focus is on responsiveness to therapeutic change, which to date has been rarely examined within psychiatry or clinical psychology. Since a questionnaire should also be stable when no clinically important change occurs, we also examined test-retest reliability within a test-retest design before treatment (n\u2009=\u200943). A pre-treatment/post-treatment design was used for responsiveness to therapeutic change, comparing the SQ-48 with two internationally widely used instruments: the Brief Symptom Inventory (n\u2009=\u200997) and the Outcome Questionnaire-45 (n\u2009=\u2009109). The results showed that the SQ-48 has excellent test-retest reliability and good responsiveness to therapeutic change, without significant differences between the questionnaires in terms of responsiveness.

Historically, families have almost been invisible in FPC. The aim of this study was to uncover beliefs among healthcare professionals concerning families of patients admitted for FPC. Using a hermeneutical approach inspired by Gadamer's philosophy, group interviews with healthcare professionals in four Swedish forensic psychiatric clinics were analyzed. Analysis resulted in seven key beliefs. There were three beliefs about families: family belongingness is a resource for the patient; most families are broken and not possible to trust; and most families get in the way of the patient's care. Four beliefs concerned encounters with families: it is important to achieve a balance and control over the family; it is essential to set aside one's own values and morals; family-oriented work is an impossible mission; and family oriented work requires welcoming the families. Despite ethical dilemmas of working with families in FPC, healthcare professionals showed a willingness and desire to work in a more family-oriented manner.

The short version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-D) was used to evaluate their mental health status. Pain intensity was rated on a numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0 to 10 by patients and physicians. Patients with a previously diagnosed psychiatric disorder were compared to those without or with newly diagnosed psychiatric symptoms, based on PHQ-D results. Pain and psychopharmacological medication were assessed. Opioid doses were converted into oral morphine equivalents (OMEs).\nSome 68 patients were included. Previously undetected psychiatric symptoms were identified in 38% (26 of 68), preexisting psychiatric comorbidities were evident in 25% (17), and no psychiatric symptoms were observed in 37% (25). Patients with a preexisting psychiatric comorbidity received antidepressants and benzodiazepines significantly more often than patients without or with previously undetected psychiatric symptoms (p < 0.001).

Independent variables were chosen on the basis of prior research and model fit was cross-validated.\nA total of 738 inpatient episodes were included. Seven patient characteristics showed significant effects on length of stay. The strongest increasing effects were found in the presence of affective disorders as main diagnosis, followed by severity of disease and chronicity of disease. The strongest decreasing effects were found in danger to others, followed by the presence of substance-related disorders as main diagnosis, the daily requirement of somatic care and male gender. The squared correlation between out-of-sample predictions and observed values was 0.14.

A discrete time duration model with a difference-in-difference specification and time-varying coefficients is estimated to assess variations in policy effects over length of stay. Among patients whose costs are fully reimbursed by the mixed scheme, the model demonstrates a significant effect of marginal revenue on length of stay. No significant policy effects are found among patients for whom only health insurance rates are delivered as mixed tariffs and government contributions are made retrospectively. The results indicate that marginal revenue can affect length of stay in inpatient psychiatry facilities, but that the reduction in marginal revenue must be sufficiently large."}, {"Title": "Vitamin D Levels and Sociodemographic and Clinical Correlates in Individuals With Serious Mental Illness Admitted to an Acute Psychiatry Unit.", "Abstract": "To describe the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in psychiatric inpatients with serious mental illness.

However, how clinical diagnostic procedures in psychiatry should be adapted to these new insights is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimmunological alterations and their association with cerebral MRI (cMRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) findings. From 2006 to 2013, we acquired 180 CSF samples from psychotic patients. Between 2006 and 2009, CSF examinations were only performed in cases in which organic brain disease was suspected. Since then, this procedure has been integrated into our routine diagnostic workup. CSF basic diagnostics were supplemented by measuring antineuronal antibodies against intracellular synaptic antigens, antibodies against intracellular onconeural antigens, antibodies against neuronal cell surface antigens and thyroid antibodies. In addition, cMRIs and EEGs were conducted. We found white cell counts elevated in 3.4% of the cases, albumin quotient elevated in 21.8%, and protein concentration elevated in 42.2%. Evidence of intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis was found in 7.2% of the cases. Antibodies measured against neuronal cell surface antigens were positive in 3.2%. Reactivity on antibodies against intracellular onconeural antigens were detected in 3.5%. Serum thyroid antibodies were elevated in 24.7%. Abnormalities were found in 39.5% of cMRIs and in 34.3% of EEGs. The main finding of our study was the high prevalence of CSF and autoantibody abnormalities in 54.4% of psychotic patients. In combination with cMRIs and EEGs, 75.6% showed abnormal findings. Our results are discussed with regard to the concept of immunological encephalopathy.

However, in the same sense that a comparative approach to neuroanatomy allows for the identification of patterns of brain organization, the inclusion of other species and an adoption of comparative viewpoints in behavioral neuroscience could also lead to increases in knowledge relevant to biological psychiatry. Specifically, this approach could help to identify conserved features of brain structure and behavior, as well as to understand how variation in gene expression or developmental trajectories relates to variation in brain and behavior pertinent to psychiatric disorders. To achieve this goal, the current focus on mammalian species must be expanded to include other species, including non-mammalian taxa. In this article, we review behavioral neuroscientific experiments in non-mammalian species, including traditional \"model organisms\" (zebrafish and Drosophila) as well as in other species which can be used as \"reference.\" The application of these domains in biological psychiatry and their translational relevance is considered."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry and psychology integrated in somatics is a profit for the clinic.

A multi-dimensional and inter-sectoral intervention is hypothesized to improve the adherence of psychiatric patients to their pharmacotherapy.\n269 patients from a German university hospital were included in a prospective, open, clinical trial with consecutive control and intervention groups. Control patients (09/2012-03/2013) received usual care, whereas intervention patients (05/2013-12/2013) underwent a program to enhance adherence during their stay and up to three months after discharge. The program consisted of therapy simplification and individualized patient education (multi-dimensional component) during the stay and at discharge, as well as subsequent phone calls after discharge (inter-sectoral component). Adherence was measured by the \"Medication Adherence Report Scale\" (MARS) and the \"Drug Attitude Inventory\" (DAI).\nThe improvement in the MARS score between admission and three months after discharge was 1.33 points (95% CI: 0.73-1.93) higher in the intervention group compared to controls.

A Naturalistic Long Term Follow Up Study from a Tertiary Care Centre.", "Abstract": "Very little is known about the long term diagnostic stability of Dhat (semen loss) syndrome owing to a dearth of follow up studies on this condition.\nThe aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic stability and naturalistic long term outcomes in a group of pure Dhat syndrome cases.\nThe study was carried out in the outpatient psychiatry department of a tertiary care hospital in South India, using a retrospective cohort design. Forty one cases of 'pure' Dhat syndrome (with no other concurrent diagnosis) were selected by a chart review of patients attending the outpatient Psychiatry department. Out of this initial cohort, follow up interviews were held for 36 patients. Direct clinical interviews were held with all participants to assess change in diagnosis. Those who no longer qualified for Dhat syndrome were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) to generate other diagnoses. For analysis, the patients were divided into two groups - those who positively endorsed symptoms of Dhat syndrome at follow up (DSP group) and those who no longer did (DSN group). These groups were compared using chi-square test for categorical variables and student t-test for continuous variables to look for significant differences. Frequencies and percentages were used to depict socio-demographic data and the follow up diagnoses.\nData was analysed using SPSS for Windows, Version 16.0 (Chicago, SPSS Inc.).\nThe mean duration of follow up was 6\u00b13.5 years. Nearly two-thirds of the sample no longer fulfilled criteria for Dhat syndrome in follow up. The most common revisional diagnosis in these patients was somatoform disorders. Age, marital status and literacy distinguished the two groups. About a quarter of the sample (26.07%) was in complete remission.\nEven the purest variety of Dhat syndrome is not a stable diagnosis in the majority of patients.

This study investigated the inhibitory control abilities of children within a severe, childhood psychiatric sample.\nA medical chart review was conducted for 100 children who received a neuropsychological evaluation during a children's psychiatric inpatient program hospitalization from 2010 to 2014. Three measures neurocognitive of inhibitory control, Stroop Color-Word Score, CPT-II Commission Errors, and WCST Failure to Maintain Set were used in the present study. The presence of externalizing behaviors at hospital admission was classified as poor behavioral/self-control.\nForty-eight percent of the sample displayed evidence of inhibitory control impairment on neurocognitive measures, with 40% displaying response inhibition impairment and only 5-7% displaying interference control impairment. Similarly elevated rates of impairment were found in those children without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Depressive disorders were associated with interference control, while ADHD was associated with interference control and response inhibition. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis found that response inhibition predicted a prolonged hospitalization in an older males subgroup but not in the younger males or females subgroups.\nCurrent findings suggest that inhibitory control impairments are highly prevalent in the children's psychiatric inpatient setting and associated with specific psychiatric disorders, although the influence of these impairments on subsequent outcome may be limited to a select portion of children.

The objective of this stage was to gather the opinions from international experts on which ability and disability concepts were considered relevant to functioning in ADHD. An email-based survey was carried out amongst international experts in ADHD. Relevant functional ability and disability concepts were extracted from their responses and linked to the ICF/-CY categories by two independent researchers using a standardised linking procedure. 174 experts from 11 different disciplines and 45 different countries completed the survey. Meaningful concepts identified in their responses were linked to 185 ICF/-CY categories. Of these, 83 categories were identified by at least 5 % of the experts and considered the most relevant to ADHD: 30 of these were related to Body functions (most identified: attention functions, 85 %), 30 to Activities and Participation (most identified: school education, 52 %), 20 to Environmental factors (most identified: support from immediate family, 61 %), and 3 to Body structures (most identified: structure of brain, 83 %). Experts also provided their views on particular abilities related to ADHD, naming characteristics such as high-energy levels, flexibility and resiliency. Gender differences in the expression of ADHD identified by experts pertained mainly to females showing more internalising (e.g. anxiety, low self-esteem) and less externalising behaviours (e.g. hyperactivity), leading to a risk of late- and under-diagnosis in females.

The role of the immune system in this disorder is one of the most controversial topics in genetic psychiatry. Though inflammation has been consistently reported in bipolar patients, it remains unclear how the immunologic process influences the disorder. One of the core components of the immune system is the NF-\u03baB pathway, which plays an essential role in the development of innate and adaptive immunity. Remarkably, the NF-\u03baB pathway received only little attention in bipolar studies, as opposed to studies of related psychiatric disorders where immune dysregulation has been proposed to explain the neurodegeneration in patient conditions. If immune dysregulation can also explains the neurodegeneration in bipolar disorder, it will underscore the role of the immune system in the chronicity and pathophysiology of the disorder and may promote personalized therapeutic strategies.

Patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders or during a psychosocial crisis can develop suicidal ideation during their stay at the general hospital, especially if they suffer from chronic disease. Some somatic disorders, such as cancer, epilepsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, stroke and chronic pain conditions are associated with an increased risk of suicide. The fact that (1) a major part of patients are treated in the emergency room (ER) after a suicide attempt and (2) a suicide attempt is the strongest predictor for later completed suicide emphasizes the importance of expertise in dealing with suicidal patients in the ER. In order to improve prevention of suicides and suicide attempts within the general hospital and after discharge it is important to educate staff concerning suicidality and enhance detection of suicidal patients. A consultation and liaison psychiatrist should always be involved when there are suicidal patients on wards and in the ER. Assessment of suicidal patients has always to include clear recommendations concerning patient safety and treatment of the underlying condition as well as specific approaches in dealing with suicidal thoughts. Safety measures can include close monitoring, constant observation, restriction to means of suicide, referral to a psychiatric clinic and treatment with sedatives, generally benzodiazepines. Psychiatric disorders are ideally treated according to guidelines and clear recommendations should be given concerning treatment after discharge.

However, evidence regarding the long-term implications of such factors is weak as only one follow up study and no longitudinal studies were identified in this review.\nOur review suggests that the use of standardised empirically validated risk assessment tools would benefit the current practice of parenting assessments by improving the process by which collected information is analysed. This would enhance the accuracy of decision-making, and improve the safeguarding of the infant. Further research is needed on medium to long-term parenting outcomes, particularly regarding its relations to: the type of maternal psychiatric disorder; the quality of maternal relationships; previous attachment experience; psychiatric illness or behavioural disorder in the partner and neonatal/infant medical complications.

Focus groups were digitally recorded, the transcripts analysed in NVivo 10 using a simple thematic analysis, and quotations de-identified to protect participants.\nThe data reflected enthusiasm for the potential of stratified medicine and both service users and carers demonstrated a strong desire to help others. However, some service users and carers feared poor performance on neuropsychological assessments, and reported that certain medication side effects might discourage them from undergoing procedures demanding immobility and concentration. Concerns were voiced that stratified medicine could encourage an overemphasis on biological symptoms, at the expense of psychosocial factors and subjective experience.\nPeople with experience of treatment resistant schizophrenia would welcome stratified medicine research; however researchers should take into account how such experience might inflect service users' willingness to undergo various procedures in the context of this research. These results reinforce the value of service user perspectives in the development and evaluation of novel treatment approaches."}, {"Title": "Protocol for a statewide randomized controlled trial to compare three training models for implementing an evidence-based treatment.", "Abstract": "Evidence-based treatments (EBTs) are available for treating childhood behavioral health challenges. Despite EBTs' potential to help children and families, they have primarily remained in university settings. Little empirical evidence exists regarding how specific, commonly used training and quality control models are effective in changing practice, achieving full implementation, and supporting positive client outcomes.\nThis study (NIMH RO1 MH095750; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02543359), which is currently in progress, will evaluate the effectiveness of three training models (Learning Collaborative (LC), Cascading Model (CM), and Distance Education (DE)) to implement a well-established EBT , Parent-Child Interaction Therapy, in real-world, community settings. The three models differ in their costs, skill training, quality control methods, and capacity to address broader implementation challenges. The project is guided by three specific aims: (1) to build knowledge about training outcomes, (2) to build knowledge about implementation outcomes, and (3) to test the differential impact of training clinicians using LC, CM, and DE models on key client outcomes. Fifty (50) licensed psychiatric clinics across Pennsylvania were randomized to one of the three training conditions: (1) LC, (2) CM, or (3) DE. The impact of training on practice skills (clinician level) and implementation/sustainment outcomes (clinic level) are being evaluated at four timepoints coinciding with the training schedule: baseline, 6 (mid), 12 (post), and 24\u00a0months (1\u00a0year follow-up). Immediately after training begins, parent-child dyads (client level) are recruited from the caseloads of participating clinicians. Client outcomes are being assessed at four timepoints (pre-treatment, 1, 6, and 12\u00a0months after the pre-treatment).\nThis proposal builds on an ongoing initiative to implement an EBT statewide. A team of diverse stakeholders including state policy makers, payers, consumers, service providers, and academics from different, but complementary areas (e.g., public health, social work, psychiatry), has been assembled to guide the research plan by incorporating input from multidimensional perspective.\nClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02543359."}, {"Title": "Depression--An emerging indication for botulinum toxin treatment.", "Abstract": "The treatment of glabellar frown lines with botulinum toxin injection is one of the most prevalent procedures in esthetic medicine. It is possible that the popularity of this intervention is not only owing to its cosmetic effect but also to modulatory effects on mood and affectivity. Recently, a series of studies including three randomized controlled trials have consistently shown that such effects can be used in the treatment of depression. Predominantly female patients suffering from partly chronic and treatment resistant unipolar depression experienced a quick, strong and sustained improvement in depressive symptoms after a single glabellar treatment with botulinum toxin A as a sole or adjunctive therapy. If these findings are further corroborated in additional studies, the ever-growing spectrum of applications for botulinum toxin may spread into the field of psychiatry, showing that the superficial paralysis of facial muscles may, probably via proprioceptive feedback mechanisms, have profound effects on the emotional brain."}, {"Title": "Labeled Graph Kernel for Behavior Analysis.", "Abstract": "Automatic behavior analysis from video is a major topic in many areas of research, including computer vision, multimedia, robotics, biology, cognitive science, social psychology, psychiatry, and linguistics. Two major problems are of interest when analyzing behavior. First, we wish to automatically categorize observed behaviors into a discrete set of classes (i.e., classification). For example, to determine word production from video sequences in sign language. Second, we wish to understand the relevance of each behavioral feature in achieving this classification (i.e., decoding). For instance, to know which behavior variables are used to discriminate between the words apple and onion in American Sign Language (ASL). The present paper proposes to model behavior using a labeled graph, where the nodes define behavioral features and the edges are labels specifying their order (e.g., before, overlaps, start). In this approach, classification reduces to a simple labeled graph matching. Unfortunately, the complexity of labeled graph matching grows exponentially with the number of categories we wish to represent. Here, we derive a graph kernel to quickly and accurately compute this graph similarity. This approach is very general and can be plugged into any kernel-based classifier. Specifically, we derive a Labeled Graph Support Vector Machine (LGSVM) and a Labeled Graph Logistic Regressor (LGLR) that can be readily employed to discriminate between many actions (e.g., sign language concepts). The derived approach can be readily used for decoding too, yielding invaluable information for the understanding of a problem (e.g., to know how to teach a sign language). The derived algorithms allow us to achieve higher accuracy results than those of state-of-the-art algorithms in a fraction of the time. We show experimental results on a variety of problems and datasets, including multimodal data."}, {"Title": "The Beginning Psychotherapist and Borderline Personality Disorder: Basic Treatment Principles and Clinical Foci.", "Abstract": "Borderline personality disorder is a prevalent psychopathology; thus, most graduate students in psychology, residents in psychiatry, and early career clinicians will encounter patients with this disorder in the course of their training or initial professional practice.

The case describes a 20-year-old man being treated in the psychiatry ward for worsening depression when he started complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. His list of medications included clozapine, lithium, lorazepam, and haloperidol. The main findings on physical examination were tachycardia, low-grade fever, crackles in both lung bases on auscultation, and the absence of any notable edema. Abnormal labs included a troponin of 0.9, with a CK of 245 and CK-MB of 3.1. An ECG revealed sinus tachycardia and left anterior fascicular block (LAFB). An echocardiogram revealed global hypokinesis, severe left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction estimated at 20%. The patient had an admitting diagnosis of acute left ventricular systolic dysfunction likely secondary to drug-induced myocarditis (suspect clozapine) versus acute coronary syndrome. He was managed conservatively and transferred to another facility for endomyocardial biopsy confirming myocarditis. This case is an example of one of the most typical presentations of suspected drug-induced acute myocarditis and will hopefully prompt the reader to think of this underdiagnosed entity in the right clinical setting."}, {"Title": "Correlates of major medication side effects interfering with daily performance: results from a cross-sectional cohort study of older psychiatric patients.", "Abstract": "Polypharmacy is common among older persons who are also vulnerable to side effects.

Efficacy and acceptability of psychological interventions for depression.", "Abstract": "In the past several decades, increasing evidence supports the efficacy of psychotherapies for depression. The vast majority of findings from meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and naturalistic studies have demonstrated that well-established psychotherapies (behavioural activation, problem-solving therapy, psychodynamic therapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy and emotion-focused therapy) are superior to no-treatment and control conditions, and are in most cases equally effective in treating depression. However, despite this abundant support for psychotherapies, studies have also consistently shown high drop-out rates, high percentages of non-respondent patients who experience treatment failures, and mixed findings regarding the enduring effects of psychotherapy. Thus, there is a need to develop more personalised treatment models tailored to patients' needs.

In this paper, I use the example of children's early stress exposure to illustrate how developmental psychopathologists now tend to deemphasize diagnostic categories and, instead, emphasize the social and biological contexts, events and circumstances that have created opportunities for maladaptive responses and health problems in youth. This example shows that developmental psychopathology is increasing understanding of how children develop the abilities that allow them to cope effectively with challenges and what leads to failures in development of these abilities. Integrating research about the neurobiology of learning may prove to be a powerful future direction to understand how the environment regulates behavior. Learning processes become increasingly intricate and fine-tuned as relevant neuroanatomical systems develop, and as the range, complexity and amount of environmental information increases for the developing child. A focus on these processes allows psychopathologists to formulate questions about which neural mechanisms children use to process information, how these mechanisms are themselves shaped by social context, why adverse social environments confer risk for children, and, perhaps, what sorts of neutrally informed interventions might remediate the deficits in self-regulation that underlie common psychopathologies."}, {"Title": "Doing more for mental health.", "Abstract": "Mental health is an integral part of all child health, and therefore, a vital part of paediatric practice, for which paediatricians often feel ill-prepared and unsupported.

One treatment option is to switch the patient to a different medication. Another option is to add a medication to the patient's current pharmacotherapy. This article presents an improvement of symptoms induced by a combination of moclobemide (MOC) and agomelatine (AG) treatment in a 48-year-old Caucasian woman with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). The patient had been treated with numerous antidepressants in the last 2 years that had not been effective or had caused serious adverse effects. When MOC 300\u00a0mg daily was added to AG 25\u00a0mg daily, the patient recovered progressively without any adverse effects. Her functional status also appeared stable. No other drugs known to interact with AG were administered.

Superior Court.", "Abstract": "Forensic psychologists and psychiatrists are licensed in their respective professions, but they perform most of their work with attorneys in the legal arena. Both attorneys and mental health professionals place high value on confidentiality of information, reflected in the ethics of their professions and codified into laws governing their work. In psychology and psychiatry, there are some well-known exceptions to confidentiality; two primary exceptions include the mandated reporting of suspected child abuse and various \"Tarasoff\" duty to warn or protect laws. Generally, however, the corresponding duty for attorneys to report suspected child abuse or to warn or protect intended victims of threatened harm is not as extensive. This difference in mandated reporting responsibilities can create significant difficulties when attorneys need to retain forensic psychologists and psychiatrists to evaluate their clients, especially in criminal contexts. If the retained psychologist or psychiatrist is required to report suspected abuse or threatened harm, the attorney may be harming his or her client's legal interests by using the forensic psychologist or psychiatrist to evaluate his or her client. This article will briefly review the development of mandated reporting laws for psychologists and psychiatrists and juxtapose those with the legal and ethical requirements of confidentiality for attorneys embodied in the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product privilege. The article will then discuss the California Court of Appeals case in Elijah W. v. Superior Court, where the court addressed the issue of whether retained mental health professionals must report suspected child abuse and threatened harm to others as required by law or if they do not need to report because they come under the umbrella of the attorney work product privilege.

The goal of this study was to develop several data quality indicators computed from data, in order to be able to detect respondents that provide less valid or reliable data.\nDuring approximately 1\u00a0year on average, 137 patients with DSM-IV diagnosed bipolar disorder rated their mood, functioning and number of alcohol units consumed on a daily basis. Three kinds of quality indicators were developed: (1) compliance (i.e. completeness of recording on a daily basis), (2) the association between conceptually related variables-construct validity-and (3) reactivity: any changes in alcohol-drinking behaviour due to the assessments themselves. Relations were measured with Spearman's rho.\nA relation was found between data quality and illness severity: respondents with lower data quality, according to our operationalisations, were more strongly affected by the illness, as expressed in the number of ill days, than respondents with higher data quality.\nThe more affected patients are by the illness, the lower the data quality to be expected in life chart reports."}, {"Title": "Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry-from theory to clinical practice: an observational study in a general hospital.", "Abstract": "To investigate significant association between various clinical and extra-clinical factors brought out the activities of Consultation-Liaison Service.\nData from all psychiatric consultations for patients admitted to the Perugia General Hospital and carried out over a 1-year period (from July the 1st 2009 to June the 30th 2010) were collected by a structured clinical report including: socio-demographic features, features of referrals, features of back-referrals.

Our main focus will be on a scientific and realistic approach to classification.\nWe discuss the literature from historical, scientific and philosophical perspectives.\nEver since the publication of DSM-III, discussions about DSM classification and an analogous debate in philosophy have mirrored the epistemological debate between scientific realism and antirealism.

This paper discusses the meaning and clinical applications of the psychodynamic related to psychopharmacotherapy for difficult personality and eating disorders patients. The one of the psychodynamic explanations for patients' being difficult is related to their perceived lack of mentalizing (reflective) capacities. Lack of mentalizing capacity implies disturbed view of psychopharmacotherapy. Therapeutic relationship and optimal alliance offers the frame for acceptance of psychiatric drugs as positive and useful for personality and eating disorder patients. Mentalization and intersubjectivity theories have direct implications for clinical practice, and that the notion of the third is particularly useful in understanding what happens in the patient-doctor relationship."}, {"Title": "Creative, person-centered and narrative psychopharmacotherapy or how to prevent and overcome treatment resistance in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Despite of the huge progress in clinical psychopharmacology and recent introduction of many new mental health medicines, a significant proportion of psychiatric patients do not respond satisfactory to pharmacological treatment. Such patients are commonly labeled \"treatment resistant\" although there is no full agreement about definition of the term. The precise prevalence of treatment resistance is hard to determine due to the lack of consensus regarding the term definition and too many cases of pseudo-resistance. Resistant and refractory mental disorders have significant economic, social, physical, and psychological consequences. The suffering and disability associated with chronic, unremitting mental disorders is profound. Changing treatment philosophy may be a critical step towards overcoming what some view as \"therapeutic stagnation in psychiatry\" and providing better treatment effectiveness and efficiency for patients benefit. A \"paradigm shift\" is needed from the mechanistic, formistic and reducionistic way of thinking of technical and impersonal psychopharmacology to contextual and systemic thinking with new treatment holodigm individualizing and personalizing psychopharmacotherapy in a more creative manner. Treatment resistance as a construct should be reconsidered as well as \"monotherapy before polytherapy\" treatment strategy. The best treatments are those that utilize and integrate multiple therapeutic modalities. The concept of creative, person-centered narrative psychopharmacotherapy gives a hope for increasing treatment effectiveness and efficiency in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Risky driving among UK regular armed forces personnel: changes over time.", "Abstract": "To compare the prevalence of self-reported risky driving in a sample of UK military personnel at 2 different time points (2004 and 2009), and to identify the incidence of new onset risky driving and possible determinants of becoming a new risky driver.\nData were used from 2 phases of a military cohort study investigating the health and well-being of UK military personnel between 2004 and 2009. Participants were included if they were undertaking regular (rather than reserve) engagements, had completed both surveys and reported being a driver at both surveys. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between risky driving status and sociodemographic and military characteristics. Data analysis was conducted in 2011.\nThe prevalence of risky driving reduced from 18% to 14%, over an average of 3.3\u2005years. The incidence of new onset risky driving was 7%. Predictors for becoming a new risky driver were: younger age, not being in a relationship at phase 2 and harmful alcohol use. Those deployed after 2007 were less likely to become risky drivers following deployment, compared with those deployed before 2007 (adjusted OR 0.62 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.95)).\nThe prevalence of becoming a risky driver appears to have reduced over time.

While several medical schools have implemented a review session to help consolidate knowledge acquired during the clerkship, the effects of such an intervention are not yet well-established. An improvement in NBME psychiatry examination scores has previously been reported with a single end-of-clerkship review session, but this was limited by a small sample size and the fact that attendance at the review session was optional, leading to likely selection bias. <b>Methods:</b> A 1.5-hour structured review session was conducted for medical students in the last week of each 4-week psychiatry clerkship between September 2014 and July 2015. Students were required to attend unless excused due to scheduling conflicts. Scores on the NBME psychiatry subject exam were compared with those of students taking the examination in the corresponding time period in each of the previous two academic years. <b>Results:</b> 83 students took the exam during the experimental period, while 176 took the exam during the control period. Statistically significant improvements were found in mean score (p=0.03), mean for the two lowest scores in each group (p<0.0007), and percentage of students scoring 70 or less (p=0.03).\u00a0Percentage of students achieving the maximum possible score (99) was higher in the experimental group, but did not reach significance (p=0.06). <b>Conclusions:</b> An end-of-clerkship review session led to increased mean scores on the NBME psychiatry subject examination, particularly for students at the lower end of the score range.

Clinical and psychosocial measures have been recently introduced to assess functional outcome.\nThe study presented here was designed to examine the rates of symptomatic remission, psychosocial remission, global functioning, and clinical global impressions in a sample of schizophrenia outpatients in order to assess functional remission and to identify predictive factors for functional remission.\nA total of 168 consecutive Mexican outpatients receiving pharmacological treatment at the National Institute of Psychiatry in Mexico City were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Symptomatic remission was assessed according to the definition and criteria proposed by the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale. Psychosocial remission was assessed according to Barak criteria using the Psychosocial Remission in Schizophrenia scale. Functioning was measured with the Global Assessment of Functioning, and clinical outcome with the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Scale.\nFindings showed that 45.2% of patients fulfilled the symptomatic remission criteria, 32.1% achieved psychosocial remission, and 53% reported adequate functioning. However, the combination of these three outcome criteria - symptomatic, psychosocial remission, and functioning - indicated that 14.9% of the patients achieved our predefined functional remission outcome. The logistic regression model included five predictive variables for functional remission: (1) being employed, (2) use of atypical antipsychotics, (3) lower number of medications, (4) lower negative symptom severity, and (5) lower excitement symptom severity.\nThe study demonstrated that symptomatic remission, psychosocial remission, and functioning could be achievable goals for a considerable number of patients. The outcome of functional remission was achieved by a minority of patients, less than 15%.

The Threshold Assessment Grid (TAG) is a brief structured assessment tool which is applied to written referrals with the aim of identifying the severity of mental illness and suitability for further psychological treatment by assessing perceived risk, safety concerns and clinical factors.\nThe TAG criteria were used to structure a brief TAG-triage face-to-face assessment. As the use of triage has not been evaluated within a military occupational mental health service, differences in clinical and occupational outcomes were compared following either standard face-to-face assessment or receipt of TAG-triage interview among members of the UK Armed Forces who were referred for mental health assessment. During a period of service development, 56.6% of patients referred to a military mental health team received TAG-triage assessment (n=419) and 43.5% were assessed as usual (n=323).\nThere were no significant differences in rank, age, sex and Service background between patients allocated to the two forms of assessment.

Schizophrenia and autism are difficult to treat and often cause major individual suffering largely owing to our limited understanding of the disease biology. Thus our understanding of the biological pathogenesis needs to be substantiated to enable development of more targeted treatment options with improved efficacy. Insights into the pre-morbid disease dynamics, the morbid condition and the underlying biological disease mechanisms may come from studies of subjects with homogenous etiologies. Breakthroughs in psychiatric genetics have shown that several genetic anomalies predispose for neurodevelopmental brain disorders. We have established a Danish research initiative to study the common microdeletion at chromosome 22q11.2, which is one of the genetic anomalies that confer high risk of schizophrenia, autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nThe study applies a \"cause-to-outcome\" strategy to identify pre-morbid pathogenesis and underlying biological disease mechanisms of psychosis and secondarily the morbid condition of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. We use a population based epidemiological design to inform on disease prevalence, environmental risk factors and familial disposition for mental health disorders and a case control study design to map the functional effects across behavioral and neurophysiological traits of the 22q11 deletion in a recruited sample of Danish individuals.\nIdentification of predictive pre-morbid clinical, cognitive, functional and structural brain alterations in 22q11 deletion carriers may alter current clinical practice from symptomatic therapy of manifest mental illness into early intervention strategies, which may also be applicable to at risk subjects without known etiology.

A replication study was performed in another hospital on a random sample of 118 patients.\nIn both studies, patients who were recommended for psychiatric hospitalization showed significantly higher levels of anger/aggressiveness, apathy, impulsivity, reality distortion, thought disorganization and activation. Multivariate analysis identified psychopathological dimensions (reality distortion, impulsivity, apathy), diagnosis of psychotic or mood disorders and proposal for compulsory admission as independent predictors of psychiatric hospitalization. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the dimensional evaluation was the strongest predictor.\nOur findings suggest that, in emergency setting, a systematic dimensional assessment may usefully complement the categorical assessment. Future research should aim at developing an operational assessment model, including both categorical and dimensional approaches to psychopathology."}, {"Title": "[Allegations of sexual misconduct against physicians and possible defence strategies].", "Abstract": "Allegations of sexual misconduct against physicians by patients, as well as their relatives, are becoming more prevalent recently. No physician is immuned against such allegations. However, several medical specialties are at an increased risk for such claims; among them are Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatrics, Psychiatry and Family Physicians. Such claims can also be forwarded by relatives or friends. The law that deals with sexual harassment is probably one of the most elusive and troublesome regulations.

With the 2014 Food and Drug Administration approvals of two direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir regimen and the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir regimen, we may now be in the era of all-pill regimens for HCV. Until this development, interferon-alpha along with Ribavirin has remained part of the standard of care for HCV patients. That regimen necessitates psychosocial assessment of factors affecting treatment eligibility, including interferon-alpha-related depressive symptoms, confounding psychiatric conditions, and social aspects such as homelessness affecting treatment eligibility. These factors have delayed as much as 70% of otherwise eligible candidates from interferon-based treatment, and have required treating physicians to monitor psychiatric as well as medical side effects throughout treatment. All-pill DAA regimens with the efficaciousness that would preclude reliance upon interferon-alpha or ribavirin have been anticipated for years. Efficacy studies for these recently approved DAA regimens provide evidence to assess the degree that psychosocial assessment and monitoring will be required. With shorter treatment timelines, greatly reduced side effect profiles, and easier regimens, psychosocial contraindications are greatly reduced. However, current or recent psychiatric comorbidity, and drug-drug interactions with psychiatric drugs, will require some level of clinical attention. Evidence from these efficacy studies tentatively demonstrate that the era of needing significant psychosocial assessment and monitoring may be at an end, as long as a manageable handful of clinical issues are managed."}, {"Title": "Reduction in ventral striatal activity when anticipating a reward in depression and schizophrenia: a replicated cross-diagnostic finding.", "Abstract": "In the research domain framework (RDoC), dysfunctional reward expectation has been proposed to be a cross-diagnostic domain in psychiatry, which may contribute to symptoms common to various neuropsychiatric conditions, such as anhedonia or apathy/avolition. We used a modified version of the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) paradigm to obtain functional MRI images from 22 patients with schizophrenia, 24 with depression and 21 controls. Anhedonia and other symptoms of depression, and overall positive and negative symptomatology were also measured. We hypothesized that the two clinical groups would have a reduced activity in the ventral striatum when anticipating reward (compared to anticipation of a neutral outcome) and that striatal activation would correlate with clinical measures of motivational problems and anhedonia. Results were consistent with the first hypothesis: two clusters in both the left and right ventral striatum were found to differ between the groups in reward anticipation. Post-hoc analysis showed that this was due to higher activation in the controls compared to the schizophrenia and the depression groups in the right ventral striatum, with activation differences between depression and controls also seen in the left ventral striatum. No differences were found between the two patient groups, and there were no areas of abnormal cortical activation in either group that survived correction for multiple comparisons. Reduced ventral striatal activity was related to greater anhedonia and overall depressive symptoms in the schizophrenia group, but not in the participants with depression. Findings are discussed in relation to previous literature but overall are supporting evidence of reward system dysfunction across the neuropsychiatric continuum, even if the specific clinical relevance is still not fully understood. We also discuss how the RDoC approach may help to solve some of the replication problems in psychiatric fMRI research."}, {"Title": "Simplifying sample preparation using fabric phase sorptive extraction technique for the determination of benzodiazepines in blood serum by high-performance liquid chromatography.", "Abstract": "Fabric phase sorptive extraction (FPSE), a recently introduced novel sample preparation technology, has been evaluated for the extraction of benzodiazepines from human blood serum. FPSE utilizes a flexible fabric surface as the substrate platform for creating sol-gel hybrid organic-inorganic sorbent coatings. FPSE media can be introduced directly into the sample containing the target analyte(s), requiring no need for prior sample pretreatment or clean-up. Benzodiazepines were selected as model analytes because they represent one of the most widely used therapeutic drugs in psychiatry and are also amongst the most frequently encountered drugs in forensic toxicology. The chromatographic separation of target analytes was performed on a LiChroCART-LiChrospher\u00ae100 RP-18e (5 \u00b5m, 250 \u00d7 4 mm) analytical column, operated at room temperature. Ternary gradient elution was applied with a mobile phase that consisted of acetonitrile, methanol and ammonium acetate (0.05 M), which was delivered at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Diode array detection was performed with monitoring at 240 nm. FPSE was performed using cellulose fabric extraction media coated with sol-gel poly(ethylene glycol) (sol-gel PEG). Absolute recovery values in the equilibrium state for the examined benzodiazepines were found to be 27% for bromazepam, 63% for lorazepam, 42 % for diazepam and 39% for alprazolam.

However, it remains unclear whether specific symptoms (or symptom patterns) are of comparable clinical significance across different functional domains.\nA sample of 865 self-reported worriers (aged 60 years and older) who endorsed GAD screening questions in the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, were derived from Wave 1 of the National Epidemiological Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions.\nBeing easily fatigued was significantly associated with occupational disability and a functional disability variable (restricting usual activity in any way). Irritability was significantly associated with social friction (arguments with friends, family, or colleagues) and a functional disability variable (found was unable to do something wanted to do), and poor self-perceived health was also associated with the same functional disability variable. Excessive worry, despite being among the least reported symptoms, was significantly associated with distress.\nThese findings suggest that individual GAD symptoms are differentially associated with aspects of clinical significance relevant to daily life, such as social, occupational, and functional ability. The differential impact of individual symptoms on functional status may be diluted when using symptom sum scores. A nuanced approach to assessing the clinical significance of individual GAD symptoms in older adults may be fruitful for efforts aimed at early detection and treatment."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric Conditions in Parkinson Disease: A Comparison With Classical Psychiatric Disorders.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric conditions often complicate the outcome of patients affected by Parkinson disease (PD), but they differ from classical psychiatric disorders in terms of underlying biological mechanisms, clinical presentation, and treatment response.

A careful search of articles on main databases was performed in order to obtain a comprehensive review about the main psychiatric conditions associated with PD.

These cases were analyzed by department of referral, assumed psychiatric symptoms, consensus with the symptoms found by the CLP, and recommended procedures. Assumed depressive symptoms, suicidal ideations and \"difficult\" behavior were the predominant reasons for CLP referrals. As the results suggest, CLP service was mostly \"overprovided\" because of uncertainty about the working areas of psychiatrists or overestimation of the severity of symptoms.

Prespecified secondary outcomes were changes from baseline to endpoint in depression items in K-SADS-L, clinical global impression, autonomous functioning checklist, self-perception profile, and sickness impact scale; predictors of response; and number of patients who relapse during the maintenance phase. Adverse experiences were to be compared primarily by using descriptive statistics. No coding dictionary was prespecified.\nThe efficacy of paroxetine and imipramine was not statistically or clinically significantly different from placebo for any prespecified primary or secondary efficacy outcome.

Recent studies suggest that compulsivity and impulsivity might represent a continuum, with several psychiatric disorders lying between these two extremes.

The inferior frontal gyrus-a key cortical hub for the integration of cognitive and emotional processes-exhibits both structural and functional changes in bipolar disorder, and is also functionally impaired in unaffected first-degree relatives, showing diminished engagement during inhibition of threat-related emotional stimuli. We hypothesized that this functional impairment of the inferior frontal gyrus in those at genetic risk of bipolar disorder reflects the dysfunction of broader network dynamics underlying the coordination of emotion perception and cognitive control. To test this, we studied effective connectivity in functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 41 first-degree relatives of patients with bipolar disorder, 45 matched healthy controls and 55 participants with established bipolar disorder. Dynamic causal modelling was used to model the neuronal interaction between key regions associated with fear perception (the anterior cingulate), inhibition (the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and the region upon which these influences converge, namely the inferior frontal gyrus. Network models that embodied non-linear, hierarchical relationships were the most strongly supported by data from our healthy control and bipolar participants. We observed a marked difference in the hierarchical influence of the anterior cingulate on the effective connectivity from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to the inferior frontal gyrus that is unique to the at-risk cohort. Non-specific, non-hierarchical mechanisms appear to compensate for this network disturbance. We thus establish a specific network disturbance suggesting dysfunction in the processes that support hierarchical relationships between emotion and cognitive control in those at high genetic risk for bipolar disorder."}, {"Title": "[Inpatient Dialectical Behavioral Therapy for Adolescents (DBT-A) - 10 years of experience on the psychiatric inpatient unit \"wellenreiter\"].", "Abstract": "In April 2004 the inpatient unit \"Wellenreiter\" at the Vorwerker Clinic for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy in Lubeck (Germany) opened its doors.

The aim of the present study was to study the association of serum S100B levels with antidepressant treatment response and depression severity in melancholically depressed inpatients.\nAfter a wash-out period of 1 week, 40 inpatients with melancholic depression were treated with either venlafaxine or imipramine. S100B levels and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores were assessed at baseline, after 7 weeks of treatment, and after 6 months.\nPatients with high S100B levels at baseline showed a markedly better treatment response defined as relative reduction in HAM-D scores than those with low baseline S100B levels after 7 weeks (P=.002) and 6 months (P=.003). In linear regression models, S100B was a significant predictor for treatment response at both time points. It is of interest to note that nonresponders were detected with a predictive value of 85% and a false negative rate of 7.5%. S100B levels were not associated with depression severity and did not change with clinical improvement.\nLow S100B levels predict nonresponse to venlafaxine and imipramine with high precision. Future studies have to show which treatments are effective in patients with low levels of S100B so that this biomarker will help to reduce patients' burden of nonresponding to frequently used antidepressants."}, {"Title": "[The Relationship Between Emotion Recognition and the Symptoms of Attention Deficit and Impulsivity in Adult Patients With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder].", "Abstract": "Interpersonal relationship disorders in adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can be associated with the impairment of non-verbal communication.

However, it has also caused controversy and intense debate. In this Review, we assess available evidence and propose future directions. Accumulating research suggests that a blend of clinical staging and profiling, which naturally incorporates ARMS, might be a better guide for treatment of patients in different stages of psychiatric illness than the categorical DSM and ICD systems. Furthermore, clinical staging, with its emphasis on balancing risks and benefits, could help to prevent premature treatment or overtreatment with psychotropic drugs. Meta-analyses and reviews show that treatment of ARMS leads to a significant reduction in transition rate to a first psychosis. The debate about stigma associated with ARMS is based on scarce published work. The few studies that have been done suggest that stigma (including self-stigma) arises largely from negative societal views on psychiatric disorders and, depending on the setting and approach, not from engagement in treatment for ARMS per se. The evidence base suggests that definition of ARMS is an important step in implementation of clinical staging and profiling in psychiatry. However, more research across traditional diagnostic boundaries is needed to refine these clinical phenotypes and link them to biomarkers with the goal of personalised stepwise care.

Understanding of the variation in subjective experiences of hallucination is central to psychiatry, yet systematic empirical research on the phenomenology of auditory hallucinations remains scarce. We aimed to record a detailed and diverse collection of experiences, in the words of the people who hear voices themselves.\nWe made a 13 item questionnaire available online for 3 months. To elicit phenomenologically rich data, we designed a combination of open-ended and closed-ended questions, which drew on service-user perspectives and approaches from phenomenological psychiatry, psychology, and medical humanities. We invited people aged 16-84 years with experience of voice-hearing to take part via an advertisement circulated through clinical networks, hearing voices groups, and other mental health forums. We combined qualitative and quantitative methods, and used inductive thematic analysis to code the data and \u03c7(2) tests to test additional associations of selected codes.\nBetween Sept 9 and Nov 29, 2013, 153 participants completed the study. Most participants described hearing multiple voices (124 [81%] of 153 individuals) with characterful qualities (106 [69%] individuals). Less than half of the participants reported hearing literally auditory voices--70 (46%) individuals reported either thought-like or mixed experiences. 101 (66%) participants reported bodily sensations while they heard voices, and these sensations were significantly associated with experiences of abusive or violent voices (p=0\u00b7024). Although fear, anxiety, depression, and stress were often associated with voices, 48 (31%) participants reported positive emotions and 49 (32%) reported neutral emotions. Our statistical analysis showed that mixed voices were more likely to have changed over time (p=0\u00b7030), be internally located (p=0\u00b7010), and be conversational in nature (p=0\u00b7010).\nThis study is, to our knowledge, the largest mixed-methods investigation of auditory hallucination phenomenology so far. Our survey was completed by a diverse sample of people who hear voices with various diagnoses and clinical histories. Our findings both overlap with past large-sample investigations of auditory hallucination and suggest potentially important new findings about the association between acoustic perception and thought, somatic and multisensorial features of auditory hallucinations, and the link between auditory hallucinations and characterological entities.\nWellcome Trust."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric outcomes after pediatric sports-related concussion.", "Abstract": "The objectives of this study were twofold: (1) to examine the prevalence of emotional symptoms among children and adolescents with a sports-related concussion (SRC) who were referred to a multidisciplinary pediatric concussion program and (2) to examine the prevalence, clinical features, risk factors, and management of postinjury psychiatric outcomes among those in this clinical population.\nThe authors conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients with SRC referred to a multidisciplinary pediatric concussion program between September 2013 and October 2014. Clinical assessments carried out by a single neurosurgeon included clinical history, physical examination, and Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) scoring. Postinjury psychiatric outcomes were defined as a subjective worsening of symptoms of a preinjury psychiatric disorder or new and isolated suicidal ideation or diagnosis of a novel psychiatric disorder (NPD). An NPD was defined as a newly diagnosed psychiatric disorder that occurred in a patient with or without a lifetime preinjury psychiatric disorder after a concussion. Clinical resources, therapeutic interventions, and clinical and return-to-play outcomes are summarized.\nOne hundred seventy-four patients (mean age 14.2 years, 61.5% male) were included in the study. At least 1 emotional symptom was reported in 49.4% of the patients, and the median emotional PCSS subscore was 4 (interquartile range 1-8) among those who reported at least 1 emotional symptom. Overall, 20 (11.5%) of the patients met the study criteria for a postinjury psychiatric outcome, including 14 patients with an NPD, 2 patients with isolated suicidal ideation, and 4 patients with worsening symptoms of a preinjury psychiatric disorder. Female sex, a higher initial PCSS score, a higher emotional PCSS subscore, presence of a preinjury psychiatric history, and presence of a family history of psychiatric illness were significantly associated with postinjury psychiatric outcomes. Interventions for patients with postinjury psychiatric outcomes included pharmacological therapy alone in 2 patients (10%), cognitive behavioral therapy alone in 4 (20%), multimodal therapy in 9 (45%), and no treatment in 5 (25%). Overall, 5 (25%) of the patients with postinjury psychiatric disorders were medically cleared to return to full sports participation, whereas 5 (25%) were lost to follow-up and 9 (45%) remained in treatment by the multidisciplinary concussion program at the end of the study period. One patient who was asymptomatic at the time of initial consultation committed suicide.\nEmotional symptoms were commonly reported among pediatric patients with SRC referred to a multidisciplinary pediatric concussion program. In some cases, these symptoms contributed to the development of an NPD, isolated suicidal ideation, and worsening symptoms of a preexisting psychiatric disorder. Future research is needed to clarify the prevalence, pathophysiology, risk factors, and evidence-based management of postinjury psychiatric outcomes after pediatric SRC.

We used fMRI to measure brain activation associated with the representation of punishment or reward information during an event-related probabilistic response-reversal task, assessed with standard general linear-model-based analysis.\nOffenders with antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy displayed discrete regions of increased activation in the posterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula in response to punished errors during the task reversal phase, and decreased activation to all correct rewarded responses in the superior temporal cortex. This finding was in contrast to results for offenders without psychopathy and healthy non-offenders.\nPunishment prediction error signalling in offenders with antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy was highly atypical. This finding challenges the widely held view that such men are simply characterised by diminished neural sensitivity to punishment. Instead, this finding indicates altered organisation of the information-processing system responsible for reinforcement learning and appropriate decision making.

His name became synonymous with a proto-biological, antipsychological, brain-based, and hard-nosed nosologic approach to psychiatry. This article argues that this contemporary image of Kraepelin fails to appreciate the historical contexts in which he worked and misrepresents his own understanding of his clinical practice and research. A careful rereading and contextualization of his inaugural lecture on becoming chair of psychiatry at the University of Tartu (known at the time as the University of Dorpat) in 1886 and of the numerous editions of his famous textbook reveals that Kraepelin was, compared with our current view of him, 1) far more psychologically inclined and stimulated by the exciting early developments of scientific psychology, 2) considerably less brain-centric, and 3) nosologically more skeptical and less doctrinaire. Instead of a quest for a single \"true\" diagnostic system, his nosological agenda was expressly pragmatic and tentative: he sought to sharpen boundaries for didactic reasons and to develop diagnoses that served critical clinical needs, such as the prediction of illness course. The historical Kraepelin, who struggled with how to interrelate brain and mind-based approaches to psychiatric illness, and who appreciated the strengths and limitations of his clinically based nosology, still has quite a bit to teach modern psychiatry and can be a more generative forefather than the icon created by the neo-Kraepelinians."}, {"Title": "Arieti and Bowlby: convergence and direct influence.", "Abstract": "Arieti was a great specialist of schizophrenia and Bowlby was the initiator of attachment theory.

We report on the shape, style and characteristics of these interactions. Some of their effects are also reported. The peer mentors are hospital employees who are hired through renewable contracts or, for some, on permanent contracts. The program was led by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Mental Health for France, with the intention, beyond the creation of a 'new profession,' of transforming current practices and representations of public psychiatry teams towards recovery. The first paper discusses the general characteristics of the consumer/peer mentor meetings and the effects of this mechanism on the representations of the consumers about mental illness and more broadly about the health care system. The second paper reports on the therapeutic effects of these meetings. Some limitations and pitfalls are highlighted.\nThe program under study involved the hiring of (ex-) consumers of psychiatric services (n=29). These peer mentors are individuals 'who have had, or still have psychiatric disorders, and have experienced a process of recovery.' They were deployed in public psychiatric services after having been trainees for a year and having pursued a training of eight weeks, in parallel, that led to a peer mentor university degree. Our sample is mainly composed of patients who met at least once with a peer mentor, and who were recruited during the field survey in the sites (in-hospital, outpatient or in urban settings). We approached and spoke to patients who were likely to agree to be interviewed to share their experience and thoughts. They had to sign consent forms and thus they were told that we were working on this experimental program on peer mentors with a qualitative and inductive approach. The empirical data that is reported here comes from a qualitative sociological investigation that accompanied the evaluation of the implementation of the program between 2012 and 2014. We have conducted 74 interviews with consumers. We have a significant number of observations of the meetings between peer mentors and consumers, some of which were transcribed verbatim. We were also informed by informal discussions with consumers in every service, and through direct interviews with peer mentors, as well as through in situ observations.\nWe used standardized prompt questions such as: 'Did you meet X,' or 'Do you know X?' We had to introduce the terms 'peer' or 'former patient.' In effect, in interviews with study participants it appeared that this 'X' was sometimes perceived as more of a nurse, and that they were not aware that this person was a 'peer mentor' or a former patient. The insistent style of some questions and the context of what could appear to be a formal assessment of a person's work might explain why study participants seemed inclined to give positive comments. A bias was also possible when study participants were recruited and 'prepared' by the treatment team for the interview. Despite these limitations, we can highlight the quality of the data.\nBy the end of the experiment, 15 peer mentors were able to find and make their place in various services, despite important differences between situations with regards to their position in the institution, their degree of autonomy and responsibility, their working arrangements with other professionals, and their actual work. However, we were able to identify common determinants: the voluntary nature of the meetings; less normativity on behavior; the supply of time and availability; a distant relation to medical drugs; a blurring of boundaries between private and professional life; specific management of distance and familiarity. Concerning representations of illness and care, we found that the peer mentors actively contribute to disseminate a vision of recovery based on a positivist conception of personality. They also allow some criticism of other professionals and of the healthcare system. Consumers, in turn, evoke interactions based on the ease of contact, proximity and availability of peer mentors. This proximity can be linked to a form of camaraderie in the institutional context of care but can also lead consumers to see, in the peer mentor, a figure of 'hope.'"}, {"Title": "[Issues, dilemmas and managerial strategies of potential ethical risks associated with the implementation of patient partnership practices in psychiatry: a case study].", "Abstract": "In terms of health and social services, the territory of the province of Quebec is covered by four large 'integrated university health networks,' which are involved in the coordination of care delivery and medical training. The francophone components of the public mental health system for Montreal are thus primarily linked to the Integrated University Health Network of University of Montreal. In 2010, the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Montreal has included in its development strategy a firm commitment to the development and implementation of the 'patient partner expertise' in research, training and care in order to make this expertise no less than the brand of the Faculty. This commitment applies to all medical specialties that are taught at University of Montreal, including in psychiatry. More recently, the Institut universitaire en sant\u00e9 mentale de Montr\u00e9al (IUSMM) has endorsed a new clinical vision that promotes full citizenship, which implies that service users and carers are considered as full partners with a specific expertise to be fully deployed. The objective of this paper is to examine, from an ethical point of view, the challenges that may be associated with involving such lay persons in various levels of mental health care planning and delivery, and in research.\nThis study is mainly based on a review of the institutional processes that are in place at the IUSMM to promote service users' participation in care planning and delivery, and in research. The focus is on the practicalities and conditions for the exercise of such an active participation, as some questions and concerns emerged through a series of interviews with different stakeholders. These issues are addressed and discussed through the lenses of the ethical values that were formalized at IUSMM.\nDespite a firm institutional commitment at IUSMM to implement its new citizenship-oriented clinical vision through greater service users' involvement, little is known about the possible negative impacts of their participation, on themselves and for regular employees. There is a consensus on the symbolic value of recognizing the potential of service users as contributors, as a peer workers or peer research assistants. This is an historic advance compared to a time when they were considered only as more or less passive recipients of services or as a simple research subjects. Some risk factors were nonetheless identified: isolation, emotional fatigue, possible relapse, insecurity, sometimes tensed relations with health or research professionals and misunderstanding. In organizational terms, among the pitfalls, the study highlighted the need for more cautious preparatory steps, guidance and support for service users and for professionals as well, and the importance of a global and integrated governance strategy.\nThis study points to three main recommendations to better anticipate and manage possible risks associated with more or less improvised service users' active participation, as lay persons, in complex planning and service delivery and in research. The first would be directed towards professionals for them to reflect on the quality of the doctor-patient relationship in their facility as to see how service users can help to improve this relationship, but among a variety of stakeholders and without being the sole responsible for such an improvement, or for the lack of improvement thereof. The second recommendation would propose to draw an objective evaluative assessment of participatory approaches at the organizational level, promoting a real return of experience and in light of the issues raised by these practices. The third would recommend an update of the organizational ethical values when introducing practices that change the current paradigms of the provision of care and services and of research."}, {"Title": "[Experimentation of care partners program in psychiatry: the model Montreal].", "Abstract": "The approach of the partnership of care and services developed by the direction collaboration dans patient partnership (DCPP) of the Faculty of medicine of the University of Montreal, considers the patient as a full care actor, in the same way as healthcare professionals, his experientiel knowledges are recognized and the patient develops gradually his self-determination.

The purpose of the article is to describe briefly this approach, to demonstrate that it is successfully applicable to mental health clienteles, under certain conditions.\nThe evaluation of this approach arises from quantitative data of self-adminitered questionnaires by the participants of continuous Improvement Commettes, as well as a reflexive approach of the participants and the members of the DCPP to understand the processes and the implemented services. The results reveal that the objectives of transformation selected through the specialized mental health CIC refer to welcoming process in the facilities, to the period of transition from a facilities service to another one, to the patient involvement in their own Interdisciplinary Plan (IIP). Among the faciliting factors for patients' participation in thse CIC: the caregivers and managers' adaptability to adjust to a patient's pace; the identification to the best communication mechanisms to get in touch with them; faciliting discussion in small working group; an existing trust relationship with the members of the CIC; the support of the resource patients between them as well as support by coach patient of the DCPP. The members of the CIC develop a sense of pride, an energy, a new motivation and a group cohesion. The patient develop a sens of belonging to the team, they experience a higher self-esteem as well as developping a sens of usefulness, by contributing to the improvement of specialized mental health facilities.

In response to the violent treatment that was common in asylums of late 18th century, Philippe Pinel conceived a 'medical moral treatment'. This paper considers the roots of the recovery paradigm in the pioneering work of Philippe Pinel and Jean-Baptiste Pussin. The aim is to discuss the early 19th century moral treatment to identify some key principles that can also inspire citizenship-oriented mental health care, but we also suggest that a simple equating of citizenship-oriented practice with moral treatment overlooks some of the central aspects of the recovery paradigm.\nOne of the main sources for this discussion is Pinel's 'Memoir on madness' (Pinel, 1794), offered for the first time to the English-speaking reader by Dora Weiner. This analysis also draws on the 'Observations of Citizen Pussin' that Pinel asked him to write for both of them to articulate fully several of the key principles of their humanistic approach.\nLooking back on the humanistic principles that were at the core of the pioneering work of Philippe Pinel and Jean-Baptiste Pussin, we suggest that the 'moral treatment' they were advocating, more than 200 years ago, was in some ways based on a genuine patient partnership, especially on peer support. The contemporary recovery movement, that might also be centered on the full exercise of citizenship, and the older 'moral treatment' have in common that they both insist that people with mental illness be treated with dignity and respect. However, while the 'moral treatment' was taking place within the asylum, the goal of citizenship-oriented mental health care is one of a life in the community for everyone. We suggest, nevertheless, that Pinel and Pussin have formulated ideas probably so forward thinking that we are just beginning to understand and try to apply them to our post-asylum practices.\nPinel's philosophy of psychiatry both undergirded moral treatment and can be useful in shaping contemporary patient-centered and citizenship-oriented practice. The insights and lessons offered by Pinel and Pussin are far from being limited to the place and time of their creation. Recent advances in mental health care have been based on insights identical to those of Pinel and Pussin regarding the episodic nature of the illness, the rarity of the illness becoming all-encompassing, the reality of recovery, and the valuable roles that employment and peer mentoring can play in promoting it. We have now seen in the two hundred years that followed the publication of Pinel's Treatise the failures of asylums to provide moral treatment to persons with mental illnesse. In contrast, citizenship-oriented care stresses the importance of self-determination and the active role of the person in recovering a sense of efficacy and agency as a foundation for full citizenship for all."}, {"Title": "Diametrical diseases reflect evolutionary-genetic tradeoffs: Evidence from psychiatry, neurology, rheumatology, oncology and immunology.", "Abstract": "Tradeoffs centrally mediate the expression of human adaptations. We propose that tradeoffs also influence the prevalence and forms of human maladaptation manifest in disease. By this logic, increased risk for one set of diseases commonly engenders decreased risk for another, diametric, set of diseases. We describe evidence for such diametric sets of diseases from epidemiological, genetic and molecular studies in four clinical domains: (i) psychiatry (autism vs psychotic-affective conditions), (ii) rheumatology (osteoarthritis vs osteoporosis), (iii) oncology and neurology (cancer vs neurodegenerative disorders) and (iv) immunology (autoimmunity vs infectious disease). Diametric disorders are important to recognize because genotypes or environmental factors that increase risk for one set of disorders protect from opposite disorders, thereby providing novel and direct insights into disease causes, prevention and therapy. Ascertaining the mechanisms that underlie disease-related tradeoffs should also indicate means of circumventing or alleviating them, and thus reducing the incidence and impacts of human disease in a more general way."}, {"Title": "A Drifting Concept for an Unruly Menace: A History of Psychopathy in Germany.", "Abstract": "The term \"psychopath\" has enjoyed wide currency both in popular culture and among specialists in forensic psychiatry. Historians, however, have generally neglected the subject. This essay examines the history of psychopathy in the country that first coined the term, developed the concept, and debated its treatment: Germany. While the notion can be traced to nineteenth-century psychiatric ideas about abnormal, yet not completely pathological, character traits, the figure of the psychopath emerged out of distinctly twentieth-century preoccupations and institutions. The vagueness and plasticity of the diagnosis of psychopathy proved to be one of the keys to its success, as it was embraced and employed by clinicians, researchers, and the mass media, despite attempts by some to curb its use. Within the span of a few decades, the image of the psychopath became one of a perpetual troublemaker, an individual who could not be managed within any institutional setting. By midcentury, psychopaths were no longer seen as simply nosological curiosities; rather, they were spatial problems, individuals whose defiance of institutional routine and attempts at social redemption stood in for an attributed mental status. The history of psychopathy therefore reveals how public dangers and risks can be shaped and defined by institutional limitations."}, {"Title": "Understanding the Impact of Brain Disorders: Towards a 'Horizontal Epidemiology' of Psychosocial Difficulties and Their Determinants.", "Abstract": "To test the hypothesis of 'horizontal epidemiology', i.e. that psychosocial difficulties (PSDs), such as sleep disturbances, emotional instability and difficulties in personal interactions, and their environmental determinants are experienced in common across neurological and psychiatric disorders, together called brain disorders.\nA multi-method study involving systematic literature reviews, content analysis of patient-reported outcomes and outcome instruments, clinical input and a qualitative study was carried out to generate a pool of PSD and environmental determinants relevant for nine different brain disorders, namely epilepsy, migraine, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, dementia, depression, schizophrenia and substance dependency. Information from these sources was harmonized and compiled, and after feedback from external experts, a data collection protocol including PSD and determinants common across these nine disorders was developed. This protocol was implemented as an interview in a cross-sectional study including a convenience sample of persons with one of the nine brain disorders. PSDs endorsed by at least 25% of patients with a brain disorder were considered associated with the disorder. PSD were considered common across disorders if associated to 5 out of the 9 brain disorders and if among the 5 both neurological and psychiatric conditions were represented.\nThe data collection protocol with 64 PSDs and 20 determinants was used to collect data from a convenience sample of 722 persons in four specialized health care facilities in Europe.\n57 of the PSDs and 16 of the determinants included in the protocol were found to be experienced across brain disorders.\nThis is the first evidence that supports the hypothesis of horizontal epidemiology in brain disorders. This result challenges the brain disorder-specific or vertical approach in which clinical and epidemiological research about psychosocial difficulties experienced in daily life is commonly carried in neurology and psychiatry and the way in which the corresponding health care delivery is practiced in many countries of the world."}, {"Title": "The History of Mental Health Services in Modern England: Practitioner Memories and the Direction of Future Research.", "Abstract": "Writing the recent history of mental health services requires a conscious departure from the historiographical tropes of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries which have emphasised the experience of those identified (and legally defined) as lunatics and the social, cultural, political, medical and institutional context of their treatment. A historical narrative structured around rights (to health and liberty) is now complicated by the rise of new organising categories such as 'costs', 'risks', 'needs' and 'values'. This paper, drawing on insights from a series of witness seminars attended by historians, clinicians and policymakers, proposes a programme of research to place modern mental health services in England and Wales in a richer historical context. Historians should recognise the fragmentation of the concepts of mental illness and mental health need, acknowledge the relationship between critiques of psychiatry and developments in other intellectual spheres, place the experience of the service user in the context of wider socio-economic and political change, understand the impacts of the social perception of 'risk' and of moral panic on mental health policy, relate the politics of mental health policy and resources to the general determinants of institutional change in British central and local government, and explore the sociological and institutional complexity of the evolving mental health professions and their relationships with each other and with their clients. While this is no small challenge, it is perhaps the only way to avoid the perpetuation of 'single-issue mythologies' in describing and accounting for change."}, {"Title": "'Chronophilia': Entries of Erotic Age Preference into Descriptive Psychopathology.", "Abstract": "A scientific nomenclature of erotic age preferences informed the mid- through late nineteenth century joint appearance of homosexuality and sexual abuse of minors on the medico-legal scene. Yet, even in the twenty-first century, legal, psychiatric and culture-critical dimensions of related terms are rarely cleanly distinguished. Review of primary sources shows the ongoing Western suspension of notions of 'sick desire', alongside and beyond the medicalisation of homosexuality, between metaphor, legal interdiction and postulated psychopathology. Virtually all early attention to erotic age preference occurred in the context of emergent attention to erotic gender preference. Age of attraction and age difference centrally animate modern homosexuality's pre-modern past; its earliest psychiatric nomenclature and typologies (1844-69); its early aetiologies stipulating degrees of sexual differentiation (1890 s); its concomitant sub-classification (1896-1914); its earliest psychophysiological tests (1950s); and, finally, its post-psychiatric, social scientific typologies (1980s). Several identifications of 'paedophilia' were seen throughout the 1890 s but as a trope it gained cultural momentum only during, and as a seemingly intriguing corollary of, the progressive depsychiatricisation of homosexuality across the Anglo-European world (late 1950s through 1980s). Early twentieth century sources varied in having it denote (1) a distinct perversion, thus possible 'complication' of sexual inversion (2) a discrete corollary of psychosexual differentiation akin to gender preference (3) a distinct subtype of fetishism, thus a likely imprint of early seduction (4) a more intricate expression of erotic symbolism or psychosexual complex or (5) a taste answering to culture, a lack of it, or a libertine disregard for it."}, {"Title": "Family-centered Care in the Outpatient General Psychiatry Clinic.", "Abstract": "Although family research supports family-centered care for all medical specialties, the benefit of family-centered care has not been fully realized in outpatient practice. Physicians, including psychiatrists, are not routinely taught how to work with families and may not be aware of the evidence-base for family interventions. However, some medical specialties, such as family medicine and palliative care, have a clinical practice that routinely includes the family. Clinicians working in medical clinics, such as diabetes clinics, know that successful management of chronic illness requires family involvement. Psychiatric clinics, such as The Family Center for Bipolar Disorder at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, also have a family-centered practice and show improved patient outcomes. This article provides guidelines, including clinical interview questions, to help psychiatrists practice family-centered care, either in a private office or in a general psychiatric outpatient clinic.

Our purpose was to explore the relationship between symptom dimensions and neuropsychological performances. We enrolled 35 stabilized schizophrenic outpatients of the Department of Psychiatry of Policlinico Hospital, University of Milan, who completed psychiatric Rating Scales, the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) and the Executive and Social Cognition Battery (ESCB). Disorganized dimension seems to have the most significant impact on cognition, being associated with performance in several BACS subtests (verbal memory, working memory, motor speed, symbol coding, Tower of London) and ESCB tasks (MET and Hotel task number of tasks attempted, number of broken MET rules, sum of deviations in Hotel Task). Positive dimension correlated with performance in verbal fluency, negative dimension with IOWA Test results, cognitive dimension with MET number of inefficiencies and Eyes test score. Impulsive-aggressive and depressive dimensions weakly correlated only with Faux Pas test. Our study supports the existence of a specific disorganized dimension in SKZ, separated from cognitive dimension evaluated through clinical instruments (e.g. PANSS), but capable of influencing cognitive abilities. Furthermore, it strengthens the validity of ecological tasks in evaluating cognition in SKZ."}, {"Title": "[Clinical audit on drug prescriptions for elderly patients hospitalized in a unit of psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The elderly are particularly vulnerable to the iatrogenic effects of drugs that are a major public health problem. In a geriatric care unit of a psychiatric hospital, the pharmacist, in close cooperation with the various health professionals, takes part in the optimization of drug therapy of these patients during cross-professional consultation meetings. From 2009 to 2011, an evaluation of professional practices was run through a targeted clinical audit on the theme of \"prescription drugs at the age of 75 and over\". The main objective of this study is to measure the differences between the practices and the guidelines for prescription drugs concerning the elderly, and then to analyze and amend these differences. The secondary objective is to gather data on the prescription drugs for the elderly in the particular context of a psychiatric unit.\nThe evaluation was performed using two standards: the evaluation chart of prescriptions of the Professional College of French Geriatrics (CPGF) and the French National Authority for Health and the list of Laroche et al. In the first round, after analyzing the prescriptions of 105\u00a0patients, the gap between practice and accepted standards led to the definition of three areas of improvement on the associations of neuroleptics, on the use of anticholinergic drugs and on the prescription of benzodiazepines, the latter being subject of another communication. After reassessment, the prescriptions of 101\u00a0patients were thereafter analyzed in relation to the identified areas of improvement.\nPatient samples of both phases were statistically homogeneous. Between the two evaluations, the percentage of prescriptions with at least two neuroleptics remained stable, the decline was not significant (18.1% to 13.9%, P\u22650.05). However, it was observed that the second suggested a \"conditional\" decline with dosages less than or equal to those recommended for the elderly dosages. The proportion of patients who did not take anticholinergic drugs increased from 30% to 60% (P\u22640.01). In parallel to the improvement of these criteria, it was noted that the average number of psychotropic drugs prescribed was significantly reduced (from 3.3 to 2.79\u00a0psychotropic/patients, P=0.078).\nThe involvement of a pharmacist in cross-professional meetings of a care unit of psychiatry for the elderly has contributed in setting up a clinical audit focused on the drug management of these patients. This work enabled measurement of the progress made in the use of anticholinergic drugs, following the guidelines. In the mean time, it has been highlighted that the standards used are difficult to comply with regarding some criteria. For instance, the use of neuroleptics in the case of elderly patients hospitalized in the unit of psychiatry and not in the unit of geriatrics requires specific adjustments. Indeed, there are patients whose disorders have led to psychiatric hospitalization, which may require a combination of two neuroleptics. This paved the way for us to develop, within a working group representative of all professionals involved, a list fitting our medical practice and integrated into a guidebook adapted to the drug therapy management of elderly patients in psychiatry. The approach being successful, this targeted clinical audit will be extended to patients aged 75\u00a0years and over, hospitalized in other care units of the hospital."}, {"Title": "Integrating Behavioral Health into Primary Care.", "Abstract": "Depression is one of the more common diagnoses encountered in primary care, and primary care in turn provides the majority of care for patients with depression. Many approaches have been tried in efforts to improve the outcomes of depression management. This article outlines the partnership between the University of Washington (UW) Neighborhood Clinics and the UW Department of Psychiatry in implementing a collaborative care approach to integrating the management of anxiety and depression in the ambulatory primary care setting. This program was built on the chronic care model, which utilizes a team approach to caring for the patient. In addition to the patient and the primary care provider (PCP), the team included a medical social worker (MSW) as care manager and a psychiatrist as team consultant. The MSW would manage a registry of patients with depression at a clinic with several PCPs, contacting the patients on a regular basis to assess their status, and consulting with the psychiatrist on a weekly basis to discuss patients who were not achieving the goals of care. Any recommendation (eg, a change in medication dose or class) made by the psychiatrist was communicated to the PCP, who in turn would work with the patient on the new recommendation. This collaborative care approach resulted in a significant improvement in the number of patients who achieved care plan goals. The authors believe this is an effective method for health systems to integrate mental health services into primary care.

One example is the role of mossy cells (MCs), a major DG cell type that is glutamatergic and innervates the primary output cells of the DG, the granule cells (GCs). MCs innervate the GCs as well as local circuit neurons that make GABAergic synapses on GCs, so the net effect of MCs on GCs - and therefore the output of the DG - is unclear. Here we first review fundamental information about MCs and the current hypotheses for their role in the normal DG and in diseases that involve the DG. Then we review previously published data which suggest that MCs are a source of input to a subset of GCs that are born in adulthood (adult-born GCs). In addition, we discuss the evidence that adult-born GCs may support the normal inhibitory 'gate' functions of the DG, where the GCs are a filter or gate for information from the entorhinal cortical input to area CA3. The implications are then discussed in the context of seizures and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In TLE, it has been suggested that the DG inhibitory gate is weak or broken and MC loss leads to insufficient activation of inhibitory neurons, causing hyperexcitability. That idea was called the \"dormant basket cell hypothesis.\" Recent data suggest that loss of normal adult-born GCs may also cause disinhibition, and seizure susceptibility. Therefore, we propose a reconsideration of the dormant basket cell hypothesis with an intervening adult-born GC between the MC and basket cell and call this hypothesis the \"dormant immature granule cell hypothesis.\""}, {"Title": "Stress and burnout in residents: impact of mindfulness-based resilience training.", "Abstract": "Stress and burnout impact resident physicians.

Anonymous surveys were distributed before (completed by 47 residents) and after the intervention (both completed by 30 residents); a follow-up survey was distributed 1 month later (seven residents completed all three surveys). The survey included the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, 21-question version (DASS-21), the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory, the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, and ten questions from the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire.\nAt baseline, most residents' scores were in the normal range with respect to stress; however, female residents had higher DASS-21 scores than male residents (31.7, females vs 18.4, males; P=0.002). Most residents' burnout scores were in the abnormal range, both with respect to exhaustion (38/47 residents, subscore \u22652.25) and disengagement (37/47 residents, subscore \u22652.1). Higher perceived levels of stress correlated with the instruments. Analysis of the surveys before and after the intervention showed no significant short-term change in stress, burnout, mindful-awareness, or cognitive failure. There was a trend for females and post-medical school graduate year 1 and 2 (PGY1 and PGY2) residents to have a reduction in DASS-21 scores after intervention. There was also a trend of reduced stress and burnout in residents who perceived higher stress.\nResidents who are female, PGY1 and PGY2, and who perceive residency to be stressful may benefit most from a mindfulness-based resilience intervention."}, {"Title": "The effectiveness of a new approach using movies in the training of medical students.", "Abstract": "The use of movies in medical (particularly psychiatric) education has been often limited to portraits of mental illness and psychiatrists.

In this article, we report through two clinical cases different neuropsychiatric manifestations revealing pernicious anemia. Mrs. C.O., aged 56, presented after surgery for gallstones, an acute psychiatric array associated with gait disorders. She had no history of neurological or psychiatric problems. The psychiatric interview revealed delirious syndrome, depressive symptoms and anxiety. Neurological examination noted a flaccid paraplegia with peripheral neuropathic syndrome and myoclonus in the upper limbs. At the full blood count, a macrocytosis (VGM: 112.2fl) without anemia was found. The level of vitamin B12 in the blood was low. Cerebro-spinal MRI was suggestive of a neuro-Biermer and showed hyper signal in the cervical cord on T2-weighted sagittal section. In axial section, hyper signal appears at the posterior columns in the form of V. There were no brain abnormalities. A sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy was diagnosed. The patient received vitamin B12 intramuscularly for ten days associated with neuroleptic treatment. Mrs. R.M., aged 40, was brought to the psychiatry consultation for acute behavioral disorders progressively worsening over a month. An anxiety syndrome, depressive syndrome and delirious syndrome were identified. Neurological examination showed a posterior cordonal syndrome with quadripyramidal syndrome. Full blood count showed a macrocytic anemia. Serum B12 level was collapsed. Cerebro-spinal MRI was normal. She received vitamin B12 with clinical and biological improvement. Features of pernicious anemia vary according to studies and age range. Digestive and hematological manifestations are well known. Neurological and psychiatric manifestations of pernicious anemia were also described in the early literature. They can be the initial symptoms or the only ones. However, inaugural neuropsychiatric features are often unrecognized. The most common psychiatric symptoms were depression, mania, psychotic symptoms, cognitive impairment and obsessive compulsive disorder. Neurological involvement includes mainly combined spinal sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy and dementia. Cerebellar ataxia and movement disorders are reported less often. Severity of neuropsychiatric features and therapeutic efficacy depends on the duration of signs and level of B12 deficiency. Macrocytic anemia may lack. Neuropsychiatric manifestations could be isolated or be the first manifestation of vitamin deficiency and occur without any hematological or gastrointestinal context. Pernicious anemia and serum B12 assay should be discussed in all patients with organic mental disorders, atypical psychiatric symptoms and fluctuation of symptomatology.

Integrated management of somatic and mental health problems can lead to a better understanding of the patient and improve the therapeutic relationship."}, {"Title": "[Non-invasive brain stimulation for treatment of schizophrenic psychoses].", "Abstract": "Despite many different available pharmacological and psychosocial treatment options, an optimal control of symptoms is only partly possible for most schizophrenia patients. Especially, persistent auditory hallucinations, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are difficult to treat symptoms. Several non-invasive brain stimulation techniques are increasingly being considered as new therapeutic add on options for the management of schizophrenia, targeting these symptom domains. The technique which has been available for the longest time and that is best established in clinical care is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). New stimulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) allow a more pathophysiological-based approach. This review article introduces various non-invasive brain stimulation techniques and discusses recent treatment studies on schizophrenia. In total, the novel brain stimulation techniques discussed here can be considered relevant add on therapeutic approaches for schizophrenia. In this context, the best evidence is available for the application of rTMS for the treatment of negative symptoms and persistent auditory hallucinations; however, negative studies have also been published for both indications. Studies using other non-invasive brain stimulation techniques showed promising results but further research is needed to establish the clinical efficacy. Based on a growing pathophysiological knowledge, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques provide new treatment perspectives for patients with schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Pervasive pleiotropy between psychiatric disorders and immune disorders revealed by integrative analysis of multiple GWAS.", "Abstract": "Although some existing epidemiological observations and molecular experiments suggested that brain disorders in the realm of psychiatry may be influenced by immune dysregulation, the degree of genetic overlap between psychiatric disorders and immune disorders has not been well established. We investigated this issue by integrative analysis of genome-wide association studies of 18 complex human traits/diseases (five psychiatric disorders, seven immune disorders, and others) and multiple genome-wide annotation resources (central nervous system genes, immune-related expression-quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and DNase I hypertensive sites from 98 cell lines). We detected pleiotropy in 24 of the 35 psychiatric-immune disorder pairs. The strongest pleiotropy was observed for schizophrenia-rheumatoid arthritis with MHC region included in the analysis (p = 3.9 x 10(-285), and schizophrenia-Crohn's disease with MHC region excluded (p = 1.1 x 10(-36). Significant enrichment (> 1.4 fold) of immune-related eQTL was observed in four psychiatric disorders. Genomic regions responsible for pleiotropy between psychiatric disorders and immune disorders were detected. The MHC region on chromosome 6 appears to be the most important with other regions, such as cytoband 1p13.2, also playing significant roles in pleiotropy. We also found that most alleles shared between schizophrenia and Crohn's disease have the same effect direction, with similar trend found for other disorder pairs, such as bipolar-Crohn's disease. Our results offer a novel bird's-eye view of the genetic relationship and demonstrate strong evidence for pervasive pleiotropy between psychiatric disorders and immune disorders. Our findings might open new routes for prevention and treatment strategies for these disorders based on a new appreciation of the importance of immunological mechanisms in mediating risk of many psychiatric diseases."}, {"Title": "Attitudes of Mental Health Workers Towards Early Interventions in Psychiatry: A National Survey.", "Abstract": "Early intervention (EI) is an effective strategy to improve outcomes of psychiatric disorders, but there is little evidence on mental health professionals' opinions on this approach. Hence, during conferences on this topic, we surveyed participants on the benefits, aims, and barriers to implementation of EI. Participants reported that the most important outcomes of EI were decreasing the risk of long-term social consequences, of severe psychopathological conditions, and chronicization. EI would primarily need to be implemented in the care of psychotic, eating, and mood disorders, whereas the main barriers to EI implementation were the lack of funding and of a prevention-oriented culture. Although these results might be biased by a generic attitude favoring EI, participants showed a very positive attitude towards EI and stated the need of a culture shift towards a more prevention-oriented model in a mental health setting."}, {"Title": "Comorbid depression and alcohol use disorders and prospective risk for suicide attempt in the year following inpatient hospitalization.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to identify predictors of nonfatal suicide attempts in veterans discharged from acute hospitalization with depression and/or alcohol use disorder (AUD) diagnoses. We hypothesized that primary depression confers similar risk for attempt whether or not it is accompanied by secondary AUD, and that a suicide attempt in the prior year would confer greatest risk of the variables studied.\nVeteran Health Administration (VHA) patients discharged from acute inpatient hospitalization in 2011 with AUD and/or non-bipolar depression diagnoses (N=22,319) were analyzed using information from the computerized record system and national database on suicidal behavior. Proportional hazard regression models estimated unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) and confidence intervals (95% CI) for risk of a nonfatal attempt within one year following discharge.\nAs hypothesized, primary depression with secondary AUD [AHR (95% CI)=1.41 (1.04, 1.92)] and without secondary AUD [AHR (95% CI)=1.30 (1.00, 1.71)] conferred similar prospective risk for attempt (AUD without depression, reference). Although prior suicide attempt was associated with increased risk, acute care in \"general psychiatry\" during hospitalization [AHR (95% CI)=6.35 (3.48, 13.00)] conferred the greatest risk among the variables studied. Transfer to another inpatient setting reduced risk [AHR (95% CI=0.53 (0.34, 0.79).\nAnalyses were based on administrative data and did not include information on mortality.\nWhen primary depression is severe enough to warrant inpatient hospitalization, a secondary diagnosis of AUD may not contribute additional prospective risk for nonfatal attempt. Within VHA, acute psychiatric care during hospitalization is a potential marker for increased risk for nonfatal attempt. Transfer to an additional inpatient setting may reduce risk for nonfatal attempt."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of consultation-liaison psychiatry referrals from a critical care unit of an outer suburban hospital.", "Abstract": "To describe the nature of psychiatric morbidity in patients admitted to a critical care unit of a general hospital and referred to a consultation-liaison psychiatry service.\nAnalysis of clinical records on all patients admitted to a critical care unit and referred to consultation-liaison between 2010 to end of 2011.

A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "To determine whether there is evidence that mass-media campaigns can be effective in reducing illicit drug consumption and the intent to consume.\nSystematic review of randomised and non-randomised studies.\nWe searched four electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I and CENTRAL) and further explored seven additional resources to obtain both published and unpublished materials. We appraised the quality of included studies using standardised tools. We carried out meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials and a pooled analysis of interrupted time-series and controlled before-and-after studies.\nWe identified 19 studies comprising 184,811 participants. Pooled analyses and narrative synthesis provided mixed evidence of effectiveness. Eight interventions evaluated with randomised controlled trials leaned towards no evidence of an effect, both on drug use (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.02; 95% CI -0.15 to 0.12) and the intention to use drugs (SMD -0.07; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.04). Four campaigns provided some evidence of beneficial effects in preventing drug use and two interventions provided evidence of iatrogenic effects.\nStudies were considerably heterogeneous in type of mass-media intervention, outcome measures, underlying theory, comparison groups and design. Such factors can contribute to explaining the observed variability in results. Owing to the risk of adverse effects, caution is needed in disseminating mass-media campaigns tackling drug use. Large studies conducted with appropriate methodology are warranted to consolidate the evidence base."}, {"Title": "A New Understanding of Psychopathy: The Contribution of Phenomenological Psychopathology.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study is to present a theoretical paper about a clinical issue. Our aim is to propose some clinical and semiological considerations for a psychopathological conception of psychopathy. We will discuss several major theoretical works dedicated to this nosographic entity (mainly those of Schneider [Psychopathic Personalities (1923). London, Cassell, 1950], Cleckley [The Mask of Sanity. St. Louis, Mosby, 1941] and Hare [The Hare Psychopathy Checklist - Revised Manual, ed 2. Toronto, Multi-Health Systems, 2003]).

This theoretical essay is informed by clinical situations (involving psychopaths who were interviewed in prison or in forensic centers). The method applied a phenomenological psychopathology analysis to the clinical material. We first compare Binswanger's conception of mania with psychopathic functioning. Patient behavior is similar, but there is a difference related to the dialectic between the ego and the alter ego. A patient with mania has a fundamental crisis of the ego, which a psychopath does not have. A second finding of our investigations concerns emotions and the adaptive dimension of the psychopathic disorder. An epistemological discussion of the concept of emotions reveals that psychopaths are competent in the management of emotional stimuli, which confers a psychological advantage upon them."}, {"Title": "Comparison of self-citation by peer reviewers in a journal with single-blind peer review versus a journal with open peer review.", "Abstract": "Some peer reviewers may inappropriately, or coercively request that authors include references to the reviewers' own work. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether, compared to reviews for a journal with single-blind peer review, reviews for a journal with open peer review included (1) fewer self-citations; (2) a lower proportion of self-citations without a rationale; and (3) a lower ratio of proportions of citations without a rationale in self-citations versus citations to others' work.\nPeer reviews for published manuscripts submitted in 2012 to a single-blind peer review journal, the Journal of Psychosomatic Research, were previously evaluated (Thombs et al., 2015). These were compared to publically available peer reviews of manuscripts published in 2012 in an open review journal, BMC Psychiatry.

Pills and capsules may also release their contents after a time lag, or a little at a time, or in some other predetermined way; these are time-release formulations. Many drugs in psychiatry have been time-release formulated to reduce their local adverse effects in the gastrointestinal tract, to reduce adverse effects associated with peak blood levels, or to artificially extend their half-life. Time-release formulations are associated with the added advantages of convenience of dosing, improved compliance, and less fluctuation in blood levels across the course of the day. A disadvantage of time-release formulations is that they may be incompletely absorbed; this is a serious issue in patients with acute or chronic intestinal hurry disorders, such as gastroenteritis or irritable bowel syndrome.

Indeed, the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) recently released a white paper, detailing the history of UDT, emphasizing recent advances in the laboratory and clinical science of UDT, and discussed the potential for broadening clinical utility of UDT. We conducted a survey of ASAM members to better understand their knowledge, attitudes, and practices with regard to UDT.\nASAM leadership along with clinical and laboratory experts developed a large pool of items on knowledge, attitudes, and practices around the use and implementation of UDT. These were condensed and converted to a web-based format. Two mass e-mails were sent for recruitment to the survey, with the first e-mail resulting in an open rate of 37% and the follow-up e-mail having an open rate of 34%.\nA total of 365 respondents completed the survey, with 51% indicating they were Board Certified in Addiction Medicine/Addiction Psychiatry. Up to 93% of respondents indicated they were waivered to prescribe buprenorphine, and 20% indicated that they were certified as a Medical Review Officer (MRO). A total of 93% felt confident in their ability to interpret the results of UDT, 90% used UDT to monitor both medication and illicit substance use, and 79% either agreed (48%) or strongly agreed (31%) with the statement \"it is important to do adulteration testing for aberrant behavior.\" Urine drug testing was most likely to be ordered \"when a patient is demonstrating problematic behavior\" (70%), and for \"baseline testing for new patients plus random selection of current patients\" (57%).\nThe survey revealed that UDT is widely used and highly integrated into the assessment and management of people with addictions undergoing treatment by ASAM members. Greater than 94% of respondents use testing to determine adherence, to monitor abstinence, and to detect an early relapse. The majority felt confident in their ability to interpret and use UDT results, and the vast majority had reportedly used it in changing patient management.

Even so, the actual risk for these behavioral health problems in health care-seeking physicians has been seldom explored. The aim of this study was to determine whether physicians have higher odds of treated insomnia, anxiety, and depression than the normal population.This is a nationwide population-based case-control study using the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan for the years 2007 to 2011. Physicians were obtained from the Registry for Medical Personnel in 2009. Hospital physicians who had at least 3 coded ambulatory care claims or 1 inpatient claim with a principal diagnosis of insomnia, anxiety, or depression were identified. A total of 15,150 physicians and 45,450 matched controls were enrolled. Odd ratios (ORs) of insomnia, anxiety, and depression between physicians and their control counterparts were measured.The adjusted ORs for treated insomnia, anxiety, and depression among all studied physicians were 2.028 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.892-2.175), 1.103 (95% CI, 1.020-1.193), and 0.716 (95% CI, 0.630-0.813), respectively. All specialties of physicians had significantly higher ORs for treated insomnia; among the highest was the emergency specialty.

This dualism has created boundaries between mind and body but as we know they are inextricably interlinked and influence each other. This has affected clinical practice and has increased the dichotomy between psychiatric services and the physical health care services in the West at least.

We investigated if single-subject grey matter networks were disrupted in a sample of people at familial risk of schizophrenia. Single-subject grey matter networks were extracted from structural MRI scans of 144 high risk subjects, 32 recent-onset patients and 36 healthy controls. The following network properties were calculated: size, connectivity density, degree, path length, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality and small world properties. People at risk of schizophrenia showed decreased path length and clustering in mostly prefrontal and temporal areas. Within the high risk sample, the path length of the posterior cingulate cortex and the betweenness centrality of the left inferior frontal operculum explained 81% of the variance in schizotypal cognitions, which was previously shown to be the strongest behavioural predictor of schizophrenia in the study. In contrast, local grey matter volume measurements explained 48% of variance in schizotypy. The present results suggest that single-subject grey matter networks can quantify behaviourally relevant biological alterations in people at increased risk for schizophrenia before disease onset."}, {"Title": "Study of depression and quality of life among hemodialysis patients: an Egyptian experience.", "Abstract": "Depression is common among hemodialysis patients. Even in developed countries, the prevalence of depression and its relation to health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in dialysis patients has only been poorly investigated. Furthermore, similar reports from many developing countries such as Egypt are scarce. This might be due to cultural and social concerns. This study is intended to address this important issue.\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted at the dialysis unit of the Urology and Nephrology Center, Mansoura University, Egypt. Data of 76 chronic hemodialysis patients (mean age 43.2 \u00b1 15 years; 54 males and 22 females) were retrieved. Psychiatric interview and psychometric assessment of depression and HRQOL (using an Arabic-adapted Beck Depression Inventory II and Short Form scale, respectively) were performed.\nDepression was diagnosed in 58 patients (76.3 %). Of them, 18 (23.7 %), 15 (19.7 %) and 25 patients (32.9 %) were suffering from mild, moderate and severe depression, respectively. Depressed dialysis patients group was comparable to the non-depressed group except for a higher prevalence of peripheral neuropathy (46.7 vs. 11.5 %; p = 0.034) and a less frequent use of iron therapy (52.7 vs. 86.7 %; p = 0.017). Except for role limitation due to physical problems, all HRQOL aspects were significantly worse among the whole group of depressed patients compared to the non-depressed group.\nDepression is common among our Egyptian hemodialysis patients. It seems to adversely affect almost all aspects of HRQOL. Therefore, a regular combined nephrology/psychiatry approach should be central to the medical care of hemodialysis patients in order to accurately assess for depression among them. Moreover, large national studies to delineate the prevalence and impact of depression among Egyptian hemodialysis patients are needed."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry in public mental health: easy to say, but harder to achieve.", "Abstract": "Psychiatrists are currently ill equipped to exploit the growing interest in public mental health.

This study investigates the profile of the most described cytokines in a sample of C&A inpatients affected by an acute psychiatric condition requiring hospitalization, in comparison with healthy subjects, as well as possible associations between psychosocial stressors and psychopathology and/or cytokine concentrations.\nPatients with a diagnosis of Affective, Anxiety, Adjustment, Psychotic, Obsessive-Compulsive, Tic or Tourette Disorders were consecutively recruited from our clinic between June 2010 and February 2012. Controls were recruited from the same geographic area. All subjects were between 8 and 17 years old. Twelve cytokines are compared: interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL_10, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3-induced protein-10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. Psychosocial stress was measured through the Stressful Life Events Scale, Child and Parents versions (SLES-C and SLES-P) and the evaluation of the family integrity.\nOne hundred and eleven subjects (77C&A inpatients and 34 healthy controls), of which 54 were males (49%), with a median (interquartile range) age of 16 (13.7-17.3) years, were included in this study. IL-1\u03b2, IL6, IL8, IP-10, MCP-1 and monocytes were found to be significantly higher in the patient group (p<0.05). Differences were confirmed when adjusting by BMI, age, gender and drug intake at admission for all cytokines except MCP-1. IL-8 and IL-1\u03b2 were also higher throughout the different diagnostic categories, than in control group (p<0.05). Stress measures were higher in patients.

But these drugs are associated with development of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Preventive methods of EPS are actively developed and they concentrate on personalized approach. The method of taking into account genetic characteristics of patient for prescribing of treatment was proven as effective in cardiology, oncology, HIV-medicine. In this review the modern state of pharmacogenetic research of antipsychotic-induced EPS are considered. There are pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors which impact on adverse effects. Pharmacokinetic factors are the most well-studied to date, these include genetic polymorphisms of genes of cytochrome P450. However, evidence base while does not allow to do the significant prognosis of development of EPS based on genetic testing of CYP2D6 and CYP7A2 polymorphisms. Genes of pharmacodynamics factors, which realize the EPS during antipsychotic treatment, are the wide field for research. In separate part of review research of such systems as dopaminergic, serotonergic, adrenergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, BDNF were analyzed. The role of oxidative stress factors in the pathogenesis of antipsychotic-induced EPS was enough detailed considered. The system of those factors may be used for personalized risk assessment of antipsychotics' safety in the future. Although there were numerous studies, the pharmacogenetic-based prevention of EPS before prescribing of antipsychotics was not introduced. However, it is possible to distinguish the most perspectives markers for further research. Furthermore, brief review of new candidate genes provides here, but only preliminary results were published. The main problem of the field is the lack of high- quality studies. Moreover, the several results were not replicated in repeat studies. The pharmacogenetic-based research must be standardized by ethnicity of patients. But there is the ethnical misbalance in world literature. These facts explain why the introduction of pharmacogenetic testing for risk assessment of antipsychotic-induced EPS is so difficult to achieve."}, {"Title": "Distinct effects of ASD and ADHD symptoms on reward anticipation in participants with ADHD, their unaffected siblings and healthy controls: a cross-sectional study.", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) traits are continuously distributed throughout the population, and ASD symptoms are also frequently observed in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Both ASD and ADHD have been linked to alterations in reward-related neural processing. However, whether both symptom domains interact and/or have distinct effects on reward processing in healthy and ADHD populations is currently unknown.\nWe examined how variance in ASD and ADHD symptoms in individuals with ADHD and healthy participants was related to the behavioural and neural response to reward during a monetary incentive delay (MID) task. Participants (mean age: 17.7\u00a0years, range: 10-28\u00a0years) from the NeuroIMAGE study with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD (n\u2009=\u2009136), their unaffected siblings (n\u2009=\u200983), as well as healthy controls (n\u2009=\u2009105) performed an MID task in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. ASD and ADHD symptom scores were used as predictors of the neural response to reward anticipation and reward receipt. Behavioural responses were modeled using linear mixed models; neural responses were analysed using FMRIB's Software Library (FSL) proprietary mixed effects analysis (FLAMEO).\nASD and ADHD symptoms were associated with alterations in BOLD activity during reward anticipation, but not reward receipt. Specifically, ASD scores were related to increased insular activity during reward anticipation across the sample. No interaction was found between this effect and the presence of ADHD, suggesting that ASD symptoms had no differential effect in ADHD and healthy populations. ADHD symptom scores were associated with reduced dorsolateral prefrontal activity during reward anticipation. No interactions were found between the effects of ASD and ADHD symptoms on reward processing.\nVariance in ASD and ADHD symptoms separately influence neural processing during reward anticipation in both individuals with (an increased risk of) ADHD and healthy participants. Our findings therefore suggest that both symptom domains affect reward processing through distinct mechanisms, underscoring the importance of multidimensional and multimodal assessment in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Socioeconomic inequalities in functional somatic symptoms by social and material conditions at four life course periods in Sweden: a decomposition analysis.", "Abstract": "Socioeconomic inequalities in health are deemed a worldwide public health problem, but current research is lacking on key points including determinants of socioeconomic differences in health, and not the least variations of these determinants over the life course. Using a 26-year prospective Swedish community-based cohort, we aim at decomposing socioeconomic inequalities in functional somatic symptoms by social and material life circumstances, at 4 periods of the life course.\nRepeated cross-sectional study.\nParticipants came from the Northern Swedish Cohort (n=1001), who completed questionnaires about occupational class, social and material living conditions, and symptoms at ages 16, 21, 30 and 42. Socioeconomic inequalities were estimated and decomposed using the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis.\nInequalities in symptoms between blue-collar and white-collar socioeconomic groups increased along the life course in the sample. In the decomposition analysis, a high proportion of the gap between socioeconomic groups could be explained by social and material living conditions at ages 16 (84% explained), 30 (45%) and 42 (68%), but not at age 21. Specific social (parental illness at age 16 and violence at ages 30 and 42) and material (parental unemployment at age 16, and own unemployment and financial strain at ages 30 and 42) factors contributed jointly to the health gaps.\nSocioeconomic inequalities in functional somatic symptoms increased along the life course in this Swedish cohort. A considerable portion of the social gaps in health was explained by concurrent social and material conditions, and the importance of specific adversities was dependent on the life course stage. Our findings suggest that socioeconomic inequalities in functional somatic symptoms may be reduced by addressing both social and material living conditions of disadvantaged families, and also that the life course stage needs to be taken into consideration."}, {"Title": "Acute hospital service utilization by inpatients in psychiatric hospitals.", "Abstract": "Standardized mortality ratios are twice the population average in the year following a mental health admission, yet there is a relative paucity of research on uptake of general medical care in psychiatric inpatients.\nA retrospective database analysis was performed to ascertain the frequency of acute medical care usage by psychiatric inpatients.

But the association between depression (or anxiety symptoms) and serum leptin is still unclear and controversial, despite the growing body of evidence supporting the existence of \"leptin resistance\" in obese persons. So we investigated whether common mental symptoms, obesity, and the interactive effect of these two factors have a relationship with leptin in obese patients who were candidates for bariatric surgery.\nIn all, 139 participants (mean age: 31.4 years, standard deviation: 9.3 years, 73.4% female) were enrolled at an obesity treatment center in southern Taiwan. Serum leptin levels and body mass index (BMI) were measured. The Chinese Health Questionnaire and Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire were administered.\nThe mean BMI of our participants was 39.4 kg/m(2) (\u00b16.8), and the mean leptin level was 24.5 ng/mL (\u00b19.4). In the multivariate regression models, Chinese Health Questionnaire-by-BMI and Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire-by-BMI interaction terms remained significant predictors of leptin level (\u03b2=0.16, P<0.0001; \u03b2=0.04, P<0.0001, respectively), after adjustment for age, sex, and history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, despite the inverse correlation between Chinese Health Questionnaire (or Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire) and leptin. In addition, female patients had significantly higher leptin levels than male patients.\nThe present findings confirmed that the relationship between common mental symptoms and leptin is modulated by obesity in severely obese patients. Future studies should focus on further measures of leptin receptors or signaling on the basis of these interactive effects in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Gene-Environment Interaction in Youth Depression: Replication of the 5-HTTLPR Moderation in a Diverse Setting.", "Abstract": "Replication of scientific findings is a major challenge in biomedical research. In psychiatry, the identification of measured gene-environment interactions (G\u00d7E) has promoted a heated debate over the past decade, with controversial results about its influence on disorders such as major depression. The authors sought to replicate a 2003 study on G\u00d7E in youth depression in a large birth cohort from a diverse setting.\nUsing data from the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study, and adopting a design as similar as possible to that of the original study, the authors tested whether the relationship between childhood maltreatment and a subsequent depressive episode diagnosis was moderated by 5-HTTLPR genotype. Of 5,249 individuals assessed at birth and followed up to age 18, data on the evaluation for depressive episodes in early adulthood, on childhood maltreatment, and on genotype were available for 3,558 participants, of whom 2,392 remained after conservative screening for previous depressive symptoms. Associations were investigated with logistic regression analyses and controlling for potential confounders.\nThe results replicated important findings of the original study, this time in a sample of young adults from a middle-income country: there was a differential dose-response relationship between childhood maltreatment and major depression according to 5-HTTLPR genotype.\nAfter following a research strategy as comparable as possible to that of the original study, the results corroborated the existence of a measured G\u00d7E, now in a large sample from a different sociocultural context.

Reviewers abstracted the data and assessed study designs and characteristics.\nFifty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. A random effects meta-analysis revealed a significant association of prior TBI with subsequent neurological and psychiatric diagnoses. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for the development of any illness subsequent to prior TBI was 1.67 (95% CI 1.44-1.93, p < 0.0001). Prior TBI was independently associated with both neurological (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.31-1.83, p < 0.0001) and psychiatric (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.50-2.66, p < 0.0001) outcomes. Analyses of individual diagnoses revealed higher odds of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment, depression, mixed affective disorders, and bipolar disorder in individuals with previous TBI as compared to those without TBI. This association was present when examining only studies of mild TBI and when considering the influence of study design and characteristics. Analysis of a subset of studies demonstrated no evidence that multiple TBIs were associated with higher odds of disease than a single TBI.\nHistory of TBI, including mild TBI, is associated with the development of neurological and psychiatric illness. This finding indicates that either TBI is a risk factor for heterogeneous pathological processes or that TBI may contribute to a common pathological mechanism."}, {"Title": "Imidazopyridines as a source of biological activity and their pharmacological potentials-Infrared and Raman spectroscopic evidence of their content in pharmaceuticals and plant materials.", "Abstract": "Derivatives of imidazopyridine are used in medicinal chemistry due to their biological and pharmaceutical properties.

Our study focused on patients with a chronic PD, who were investigated and treated in a conventional manner, which represents the real PD patients in clinical practice.\nContinuing their medication, patients were included in a six-week cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program in the psychiatry department. At the onset of the study, participants underwent clinical evaluation using standard scales and were examined using fMRI while listening to verbal threat-related stimuli contrasted to neutral words. According to the therapeutic outcome, they were subsequently divided into two groups, responders, and nonresponders and the two groups were mutually compared.\nIn non-responders compared to responders, we found increased pre-treatment activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally, left orbitofrontal cortex, left frontal eye field, right parietal lobule and left amygdala. In addition, both groups showed negative fMRI BOLD correlation with BAI improvement and positive correlation with CGI improvement across the ROIs. We suggest that DLPFC over-activation may reveal a lack of cognitive control over emotional processing, which makes subsequent CBT less effective.\nDespite several limitations, we found neuroimaging predictors of poor CBT response, under the conditions of standard clinical practice, in real PD patients."}, {"Title": "Patient assessment within the context of healthcare delivery packages: A comparative analysis.", "Abstract": "Due to an increased focus on productivity and cost-effectiveness, many countries across the world have implemented a variety of tools for standardizing diagnostics and treatment. In Denmark, healthcare delivery packages are increasingly used for assessment of patients. A package is a tool for creating coordination, continuity and efficient pathways; each step is pre-booked, and the package has a well-defined content within a predefined category of diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate how assessment processes took place within the context of healthcare delivery packages.\nThe study used a constructivist Grounded Theory approach. Ethnographic fieldwork was carried out in three specialized units: a mental health unit and two multiple sclerosis clinics in Southern Denmark, which all used assessment packages. Several types of data were sampled through theoretical sampling. Participant observation was conducted for a total of 126h. Formal and informal interviews were conducted with 12 healthcare professionals and 13 patients. Furthermore, audio recordings were made of 9 final consultations between physicians and patients; 193min of recorded consultations all in all. Lastly, the medical records of 13 patients and written information about packages were collected. The comparative, abductive analysis focused on the process of assessment and the work made by all the actors involved. In this paper, we emphasized the work of healthcare professionals.\nWe constructed five interrelated categories: 1. \"Standardized assessing\", 2. \"Flexibility\", which has two sub-categories, 2.1. \"Diagnostic options\" and 2.2. \"Time and organization\", and, finally, 3. \"Resisting the frames\". The process of assessment required all participants to perform the predefined work in the specified way at the specified time. Multidisciplinary teamwork was essential for the success of the process. The local organization of the packages influenced the assessment process, most notably the pre-defined scope of relevant diseases targeted by the package. The inflexible frames of the assessment package could cause resistance among clinicians. Moreover, expert knowledge was an important factor for the efficiency of the process. Some types of organizational work processes resulted in many patients being assessed, but without being diagnosed with at package-relevant disease.\nLimiting the grounds for using specialist knowledge in structured health care delivery may affect specialists' sense of professional autonomy and can result in professionals employing strategies to resist the frames of the packages. Finally, when organizing healthcare delivery packages, it seems important to consider how to make the optimal use of specialist knowledge."}, {"Title": "A Program Module to Supplement the Clinical Psychiatry Rotation for Physician Assistant Students.", "Abstract": "A recent blog article aimed at prospective physician assistants (PAs) identified psychiatry as a series of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, diagnoses supplemented by empathy and medication.

The purpose of this study was to gain insights into the experiences of nurses working in psychiatry wards, of the barriers to the nurse-patient relationship. A qualitative content-analysis study was undertaken using a purpose-based sampling approach with the participation of 15 nurses employed in psychiatric wards in hospitals located in South Iran. Semi-structured interviews provided the source of data, and an inductive content-analysis approach was used for data analysis. The main concept extracted from the study was identified as 'the therapeutic relationship in the shadow', which captured the sense that this critical relationship is mostly unseen in the daily practice of the nurses interviewed. Factors that functioned as barriers to this relationship were classified into three main categories: nurse-related, patient-related and organization-related. The results of this study revealed that, despite the widely claimed importance of the nurse-patient relationship in psychiatric settings, this relationship is powerfully influenced by individual and organizational factors that have not been considered adequately in previous research. It is strongly recommended that greater consideration of these factors be given to care planning in psychiatric wards."}, {"Title": "Digit ratio and autism spectrum disorders in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children: a birth cohort study.", "Abstract": "To investigate whether second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D), a measure commonly used as a proxy for fetal testosterone exposure, is associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as predicted by the extreme male brain theory of autism.\nA birth cohort study.\nThe Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).\n6015 ALSPAC children with data on digit ratio, at least 1 outcome measure and information on potential confounding variables (parental occupational class, maternal education and age at digit ratio measurement).

Testimonies were presented either by the prosecution or defence.\nNeurogenetic evidence significantly reduced judges' estimation of legal responsibility of the convict. Nevertheless, the average prison sentence was not affected in the German legal system.

CBT was superior to both of these control conditions, but psychological placebo was superior to waitlist. However, we argue that the term 'psychological placebo' is a misnomer because the impossibility of effectively blinding participants to treatment allocation in CBT trials makes it impossible to control for placebo effects. This failure to blind participants and therapists - and the resultant high risk of bias - was the main reason Zhu and colleagues found that the overall quality of the evidence supporting the conclusion that CBT is effective for GAD is poor. This is a general problem in all psychotherapy trials, which suffer from well-documented methodological and conceptual problems that prevent adequate placebo control and undermine casual inference.

In tandem with aging, there are robust predictions suggesting that rates of age-related cognitive decline and dementia, and geriatric depression, will increase, with serious consequences. Clearly innovative prevention and treatment strategies are needed. This article reviews the latest promising clinical advances that hold promise for assisting the prevention and treatment of depression, cognitive decline, and dementia."}, {"Title": "The Next Big Thing in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry: Interventions to Prevent and Intervene Early in Psychiatric Illnesses.", "Abstract": "The last two decades have marked tremendous progress in our ability to prevent and intervene early in psychiatric illnesses. The interventions described in this article range from established, empirically-supported treatments to creative interventions early in their development and deployment. Some of these interventions are low-technology programs delivered in social settings (such as schools), and some rely on sophisticated emerging technologies such as neuroimaging. This article reviews 4 preventative interventions: 1) The use of structural brain imaging to identify children at risk for familial depression who are most likely to benefit from preventative cognitive behavioral therapy 2) The Good Behavior Game, a school based program that, when implemented in 1st grade classrooms, cut the incidence of substance use disorders in students in half when those students were 19 years old, 3) The SPARX video game, which has the potential to be an accessible, appealing, and cost-effective treatment for the thousands of teens affected by mild to moderate depressive disorders, and 4) Intensive psychosocial treatments which can reduce the progression of from the ultra high risk state to the first episode psychosis by 50% over 12 months. All of these interventions have tremendous potential to reduce the suffering and disability caused by psychiatric illness to both children and adults."}, {"Title": "Integrated Care at the Interface of Psychiatry and Primary Care: Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease.", "Abstract": "Patients with mental illness, particularly serious mental illness, are more likely to suffer from common disorders without optimal treatment. Changes in preventive practice patterns cannot be fully realized on a large scale until clinicians are trained how to routinely provide this care. Psychiatrists may consider using preventive care strategies in the area of cardiovascular health, as cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death and disproportionately affects patients with mental illness. At minimum, psychiatrists are well positioned to work collaboratively with primary care providers to address psychopathology that may interfere with adherence to the treatment plan."}, {"Title": "A Shared Molecular and Genetic Basis for Food and Drug Addiction: Overcoming Hypodopaminergic Trait/State by Incorporating Dopamine Agonistic Therapy in Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This article focuses on the shared molecular and neurogenetics of food and drug addiction tied to the understanding of reward deficiency syndrome. Reward deficiency syndrome describes a hypodopaminergic trait/state that provides a rationale for commonality in approaches for treating long-term reduced dopamine function across the reward brain regions.

Many factors contribute to the phenotypic psychiatric profile in individual patients. These overlapping factors include but are not limited to genetics, epigenetics, central nervous system circuit alterations, family history, past personal history, environmental influences including early life stress, and more recent life stressors. The authors discuss the role of pharmacogenomics, particularly in the cytochrome P450 enzyme system in relation to treatment response.

Since 2012, by one estimate, the number of patients who have had pharmacogenetic testing has doubled and this number is expected to double again by 2015. Given the increasing evidence for genetic influences on treatment response, we deemed it important to study physicians' opinions of pharmacogenetic testing. Surveys were completed by 168 Canadian physicians who had ordered at least one pharmacogenetic test (in particular for CYP2D6 or CYP2C19) for the prescription of psychiatric medication. Our results indicated that 80% of respondents believe genetic testing would become common standard in psychiatric drug treatment and 76% of respondents reported satisfactory or higher than satisfactory understanding of the pharmacogenetic report provided. Significantly more male physicians believed they had a higher understanding of the pharmacogenetic report compared to female physicians. To our knowledge, this is the only study that has assessed physicians' opinions of pharmacogenetic testing for psychotropic medication after they had received a pharmacogenetic report. Our results demonstrate a positive opinion of physicians on pharmacogenetics and indicate great potential for future clinical application."}, {"Title": "Somatic symptoms and psychological concerns in a general adolescent population: Exploring the relevance of DSM-5 somatic symptom disorder.", "Abstract": "DSM-5 somatic symptom disorder (SSD) constitutes a major change for psychosomatic medicine and psychiatry, as well as for epidemiological research in these fields. This study investigates somatic symptoms and psychological concerns among adolescents in order to systematically explore the relevance of SSD for general adolescent populations.\nA cross-sectional population-based design, with a symptoms-based strategy and a symptom-and-psychological-concern-based strategy, was used to estimate the prevalence of somatic symptoms and psychological concerns in a general adolescent population (n=2476, mean age=16years, 49% boys, 51% girls). Somatic symptoms and psychological concerns in relation to gender, and self-reported medical and psychiatric conditions were investigated. The association between somatic symptoms, psychological concerns, and functional impairment in school-, family-, peer- and physical activities was studied.\nReporting 3+ persistent distressing somatic symptoms was significantly more common than reporting one or more persistent distressing somatic symptom(s) combined with serious psychological concern. The prevalence of such complaints was significantly higher in girls. The proportion of medical and psychiatric conditions was highest in the group reporting 3+ persistent distressing somatic symptoms combined with serious psychological concern. Belonging to this group most significantly increased odds ratios for functional impairment.\nFor large-scale studies on SSD, results suggest the use of measures based on multiple somatic items in combination with psychological concerns, and a methodologically sound standardized measure of functional impairment. To further enhance clinical decision-making, the relation of symptoms to functional impairment, and the substantial overlap of SSD with medical and psychiatric conditions during adolescence should be addressed."}, {"Title": "Practical Applications for Maintenance of Certification Products in Child and Adolescent Residency Training.", "Abstract": "The authors evaluated whether Maintenance of Certification (MOC) Performance-in-Practice products in training increases trainee knowledge of MOC processes and is viewed by trainees as a useful activity.\nSix child and adolescent psychiatry fellowships used MOC products in continuity clinics to assess their usefulness as training tools. Two surveys assessed initial knowledge of MOC and usefulness of the activity.\nForty-one fellows completed the initial survey. A majority of first-year fellows indicated lack of awareness of MOC in contrast to a majority of second-year fellows who indicated some awareness. Thirty-five fellows completed the second survey. A majority of first- and second-year fellows found the activity easy to execute and would change something about their practice as a result.\nUsing MOC products in training appears to be a useful activity that may assist training programs in teaching the principles of self- and peer-learning."}, {"Title": "Translational Perspectives for Computational Neuroimaging.", "Abstract": "Functional neuroimaging has made fundamental contributions to our understanding of brain function. It remains challenging, however, to translate these advances into diagnostic tools for psychiatry. Promising new avenues for translation are provided by computational modeling of neuroimaging data. This article reviews contemporary frameworks for computational neuroimaging, with a focus on forward models linking unobservable brain states to measurements. These approaches-biophysical network models, generative models, and model-based fMRI analyses of neuromodulation-strive to move beyond statistical characterizations and toward mechanistic explanations of neuroimaging data. Focusing on schizophrenia as a paradigmatic spectrum disease, we review applications of these models to psychiatric questions, identify methodological challenges, and highlight trends of convergence among computational neuroimaging approaches. We conclude by outlining a translational neuromodeling strategy, highlighting the importance of openly available datasets from prospective patient studies for evaluating the clinical utility of computational models."}, {"Title": "Reciprocity in therapeutic relationships: A conceptual review.", "Abstract": "Reciprocity has generally been understood as a process of giving and taking, within an exchange of emotions or services, and has long been recognized as a central part of human life. However, an understanding of reciprocity in professional helping relationships has seldom received attention, despite movements in mental health care towards more collaborative approaches between service users and professionals. In this review, a systematic search of the published papers was conducted in order to explore how reciprocity is conceptualized and understood as part of the dyadic therapeutic relationship between professionals and service users. Eleven papers met our inclusion criteria and a narrative synthesis was used to synthesize the key concepts of reciprocity. The concepts of: 'dynamic equilibrium', 'shared affect', 'asymmetric alliance', and 'recognition as a fellow human being' were recurrent in understandings of reciprocity in professional contexts. These conceptualizations of reciprocity were also linked to specific behavioural and psychological processes. The findings suggest that reciprocity may be conceptualized and incorporated as a component of mental health care, with recurrent and observable processes which may be harnessed to promote positive outcomes for service users. To this end, we make recommendations for further research to progress and develop reciprocal processes in mental health care."}, {"Title": "Mental health problems in Kosovar adolescents: results from a national mental health survey.", "Abstract": "Our purpose was to determine the effects of gender and age on Kosovar YSR scores and the prevalence of self-reported behavioral/emotional problems in Kosovar adolescents based on scores above a cutpoint.\nParticipants were 1351 adolescents recruited from secondary schools in seven regions of Kosova who completed the Youth Self-Report.\nThe oldest adolescents had the highest scores on many YSR scales. Although Kosova's mean problems scores were not elevated relative to international norms, the percentage of adolescents scoring in the deviant range (borderline + clinical) was much higher than expected for almost all YSR problem scales, including Total Problems (31.2%), Internalizing (40.8%), and Externalizing (23.4%).

However, very little research on immigrants' use of mental health service in the host country considers source country. Newcomers from different source countries may have distinct experiences that influence service need and use after arrival. This population study examined rates of use of primary care and of specialty services for non-psychotic mental health disorders by immigrants to Ontario Canada during their first five years after arrival. Service use by recent immigrants in broad source region groups representing all world regions was compared to use by age-matched Canadian-born or long term immigrants (called long term residents).\nThis matched population-based cross-sectional study assessed likelihood of any use and counts of visits for each of primary care, psychiatric care and hospital care (emergency department visits or inpatient admissions) for non-psychotic mental health disorders from 1993-2012. Adult immigrants living in urban Ontario (n\u2009=\u2009912,114) were categorized based on their nine world regions of origin. Sex-stratified conditional logistic regression models and negative binomial models were used to compare service use by immigrant region groups to\u00a0their age-matched long term residents.\nImmigrant were more or less likely to access primary mental health care compared to age-matched long term residents, depending on their world region of origin. Regarding specialty mental health care (psychiatry and hospital care), immigrants from all regions used less than long term residents. Across the three mental health services, estimates of use by immigrant region groups compared to long term residents were among the lowest for newcomers from East Asian and Pacific (range: 0.16-0.82) and among the highest for persons from Middle East and North Africa (range: 0.56-1.23).\nThis population-based study showed lower use of mental health services by recent immigrants than long-term immigrants or native born individuals, with variation in immigrants' use linked to world region of origin and type of mental health care. Variation across source region groups underscores the importance of identifying underlying individual characteristics that affect service use to make services more responsive to newcomers."}, {"Title": "'The patient': at the center of patient-reported outcomes.", "Abstract": "The recent emphasis of including patient reports in their own care management is reviewed in terms of the factors that contributed to its popularity. The role change of patients as being active participants in their own care as a result of the rising consumerism and advocacy has led to increased pressures for including patients in the therapeutic decision-making process. As consumers of clinical services, their perspectives and attitudes towards health and illness acquired more importance. The rising cost of healthcare has added another dimension in cost containment by empowering patients and sharing responsibility in their recovery, which hopefully can improve outcomes. Challenges in the development and implementation of patient-reported outcomes in psychiatry are reviewed and include the still unresolved subjective/objective dichotomy, identification of the most appropriate and relevant patient-reported outcomes. Few outcomes are identified and include: subjective tolerability of medication, self-reported health-related quality of life, preferences, patients' attitudes towards health and illness, satisfaction with medication and overall satisfaction of quality of care, and functional state, with particular focus on social functioning."}, {"Title": "Perceived current needs, psychological distress and functional impairment in a war-affected setting: a cross-sectional study in South Sudan.", "Abstract": "To examine the current perceived needs of the general population in a war-affected setting, and to study the influence of perceived needs on the participants' mental health status and functional impairment across genders.\nA cross-sectional community survey (n=464) was conducted in war-affected South Sudan. Three regression models were analysed. Perceived needs were assessed with the Humanitarian Emergency Settings Perceived Needs Scale. Psychological distress was measured with the General Health Questionnaire and level of functioning by the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12).\nThe most frequently expressed needs were related to drinking water, alcohol and drug use in the community and access to sanitation facilities. No gender differences were found regarding the level of perceived needs or the number of traumatic events. Higher level of perceived needs significantly predicted psychological distress and lower level of functioning even when numbers of experienced trauma events were taken into account.\nThe associations of higher level of needs and trauma experiences, on the one hand, and negative health outcomes on the other, necessitate a greater integration of interventions directed towards the population's perceived needs and mental health, particularly for those who have been exposed to trauma."}, {"Title": "Personal Therapy in Psychiatry Residency Training: A National Survey of Canadian Psychiatry Residents.", "Abstract": "The authors collected nationally representative data on Canadian residents' experiences with and perspectives on personal psychotherapy in their psychiatric training.\nA 43-item questionnaire was distributed electronically to all current psychiatry residents in Canada (N\u2009=\u2009839).\nFour hundred residents from every program across Canada returned the survey (response rate 47.7%).

Of residents who undertook personal psychotherapy, 59.3% engaged in weekly therapy, 74.1% received psychodynamic psychotherapy, and 81.5% participated in long-term therapy (>1 year). Personal growth, self-understanding, and professional development were the most common reasons for engaging in personal therapy; however, one-third of residents did so to alleviate symptoms of depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns. Time was the most important factor impeding residents from personal therapy; only 8.8% found stigma to act as a barrier. The vast majority of residents rated their experience with personal therapy as having a positive or very positive impact on their personal life (84.8%) and overall development as psychiatrists (81.8%). For 64% of respondents, personal therapy had an important or very important role in psychiatry residency training. Residents who received personal therapy rated themselves as better able to understand what happens moment by moment during therapy sessions, detect and deal with patients' emotional reactions, and constructively use their personal reactions to patients.\nInterest in personal therapy remains strong among psychiatry trainees in Canada. Residents who engaged in psychotherapy endorsed greater confidence in psychotherapy and rated their psychotherapy skills more favorably than those who had never been in the patient role, supporting the view of personal therapy as an important adjunct to psychotherapy training during residency."}, {"Title": "Comparison of Demographic and Diagnostic Characteristics of Iranian Inpatients With Bipolar I Disorder to Western Counterparts.", "Abstract": "Patients' characteristics influence the disorders outcome, so it is valuable to compare mood disorders and inpatients' attributes in different large samples.\nThis study was designed to assess demographic and diagnostic characteristics of 3000 Iranian inpatient with bipolar disorders.\nWe collected the information of demographic, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics of the patients who were hospitalized in Iran Hospital of Psychiatry, a university affiliated hospital in Tehran, during the 5 years from 2006 to 2011.\nAbout 66.1% of the subjects were males and 33.9% were females.

An Observational Study of Five Psychiatry Journals That Mandate Prospective Clinical Trial Registration.", "Abstract": "To address the bias occurring in the medical literature associated with selective outcome reporting, in 2005, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) introduced mandatory trial registration guidelines and member journals required prospective registration of trials prior to patient enrolment as a condition of publication. No research has examined whether these guidelines are impacting psychiatry publications. Our objectives were to determine the extent to which articles published in psychiatry journals adhering to ICMJE guidelines were correctly prospectively registered, whether there was evidence of selective outcome reporting and changes to participant numbers, and whether there was a relationship between registration status and source of funding.\nAny clinical trial (as defined by ICMJE) published between 1 January 2009 and 31 July 2013 in the top five psychiatry journals adhering to ICMJE guidelines (The American Journal of Psychiatry, Archives of General Psychiatry/JAMA Psychiatry, Biological Psychiatry, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry) and conducted after July 2005 (or 2007 for two journals) was included. For each identified trial, where possible we extracted trial registration information, changes to POMs between publication and registry to assess selective outcome reporting, changes to participant numbers, and funding type.\nOut of 3305 articles, 181 studies were identified as clinical trials requiring registration: 21 (11.6%) were deemed unregistered, 61 (33.7%) were retrospectively registered, 37 (20.4%) had unclear POMs either in the article or the registry and 2 (1.1%) were registered in an inaccessible trial registry. Only 60 (33.1%) studies were prospectively registered with clearly defined POMs; 17 of these 60 (28.3%) showed evidence of selective outcome reporting and 16 (26.7%) demonstrated a change in participant numbers of 20% or more; only 26 (14.4%) of the 181 the trials were prospectively registered and did not alter their POMs or the time frames at which they were measured. Prospective registration with no changes in POMs occurred more frequently with pharmaceutical funding.\nAlthough standards are in place to improve prospective registration and transparency in clinical trials, less than 15% of psychiatry trials were prospectively registered with no changes in POMs. Most trials were either not prospectively registered, changed POMs or the timeframes at some point after registration or changed participant numbers.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM 5) defines delirium as a disturbance in attention, awareness and cognition that develops over a short period of time and fluctuates. Possible causes of delirium are manifold: usually delirium is considered to develop in a multifactorial way, caused by inalterable parameters, such as advanced age and pre-existing cognitive impairment and precipitated by modifiable parameters, such as the use of certain drugs or substance withdrawal. Delirium is a serious condition with a pronounced impact on morbidity, mortality and costs to the healthcare system. Circumstances and drugs that might precipitate or worsen delirium should therefore be avoided whenever possible. A list of drugs that might have a detrimental influence on the emergence and duration of delirium has been created using the terms \"delirogenity\" and \"delirogenic\" to describe the potential of a drug or withdrawal to cause or worsen delirium. The results are novel and noteworthy, as their focus is on substances relevant to European pharmacotherapy. Furthermore, they represent a methodical consensus from a group of experts of a wide variety of professions relevant to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of delirium, such as nursing, pharmacy, pharmacology, surgical and internal medicine, neurology, psychiatry, intensive care and medicine, with working, teaching and scientific experience in several European countries practicing both in primary and secondary care."}, {"Title": "Fifty psychological and psychiatric terms to avoid: a list of inaccurate, misleading, misused, ambiguous, and logically confused words and phrases.", "Abstract": "The goal of this article is to promote clear thinking and clear writing among students and teachers of psychological science by curbing terminological misinformation and confusion.

We provide corrective information for students, instructors, and researchers regarding these terms, which we organize for expository purposes into five categories: inaccurate or misleading terms, frequently misused terms, ambiguous terms, oxymorons, and pleonasms. For each term, we (a) explain why it is problematic, (b) delineate one or more examples of its misuse, and (c) when pertinent, offer recommendations for preferable terms.

From mid-seventeenth to eighteenth centuries, they acquire a medical quality in mental and organic illnesses. However, the term was only fully integrated in psychiatry by Esquirol in the eighteenth-nineteenth centuries. By then, a controversy begins on whether hallucinations have a perceptual or intellectual origin. Esquirol favors the intellectual origin, describing them as an involuntary exercise of memory and imagination. By the twentieth century, some authors maintain that hallucinations are a form of delusion (Ey), while others describe them as a change in perception (Jaspers, Fish). More integrated perspectives like those proposed by Alonso Fernandez and Luque, highlights the heterogeneity of hallucinations and the multiplicity of their types and causes. The terms pseudohallucination, illusion, and hallucinosis are grafted into the concept of hallucination. Since its introduction the term pseudohallucination has been used with different meanings. The major characteristics that we found associated with pseudohallucinations were \"lack of objectivity\" and \"presence of insight\" (differing from hallucinations). Illusions are unanimously taken as distortions of real objects. Hallucinosis, first described in the context of alcohol consumption, is generally considered egodystonic, in which insight is preserved. These and other controversial aspects regarding the evolution of the term hallucination and all its derivative concepts are discussed in this paper."}, {"Title": "PREVENTING CHILD AND ADOLESCENT ANXIETY DISORDERS: OVERVIEW OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS.", "Abstract": "Overviews of systematic reviews (OSRs) provide rapid access to high quality, consolidated research evidence about prevention intervention options, supporting evidence-informed decision-making, and the identification of fruitful areas of new research. This OSR addressed three questions about prevention strategies for child and adolescent anxiety: (1) Does the intervention prevent anxiety diagnosis and/or reduce anxiety symptoms compared to passive controls? (2) Is the intervention equal to or more effective than active controls? (3) What is the evidence quality (EQ) for the intervention? Prespecified inclusion criteria identified systematic reviews and meta-analyses (2000-2014) with an AMSTAR quality score \u2265 3/5. EQ was rated using Oxford evidence levels EQ1 (highest) to EQ5 (lowest). Three reviews met inclusion criteria. One narrative systematic review concluded school-based interventions reduce anxiety symptoms. One meta-analysis pooled 65 randomized controlled trials (RCTs; any intervention) and reported a small, statistically significant reduction in anxiety symptoms and diagnosis incidence. Neither review provided pooled effect size estimates for specific intervention options defined by type (i.e., universal/selective/indicated), intervention content, or comparison group (i.e., passive/active control), thus precluding EQ ratings. One meta-analysis pooled trials of vigorous exercise and reported small, nonstatistically significant reductions in anxiety symptoms for comparisons against passive and active controls (EQ1). Better use of primary studies in meta-analyses, including program-specific pooled effect size estimates and network meta-analysis is needed to guide evidence-informed anxiety prevention program choices.

We report a patient with refractory cardiac dysrhythmias treated with defibrillation, beta-adrenergic blockade, and hemodialysis to highlight concentrated caffeine's dangers.\nA 20-year-old woman presented with severe agitation, tremor, and vomiting approximately 1-2 h after suicidal ingestion of concentrated caffeine (powder and tablets). Within minutes, ventricular fibrillation commenced. Defibrillation, intubation, and amiodarone administration achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Shortly thereafter, she developed pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VTach), with ROSC after defibrillation and lidocaine. She subsequently experienced 23 episodes of pulseless VTach, each responsive to defibrillation. Activated charcoal was administered via orogastric tube. An esmolol infusion was started.

Chronotherapy is based on a controlled exposure to environmental stimuli which affect biorhythms. One of the chronotherapeutic methods is sleep deprivation (SD). The article discusses the present status of SD in psychiatry, its methods and application in depression treatment. Presently the most recommended pattern is combining total sleep deprivation (TSD), sleep phase advance (SPA), pharmacotherapy, and sometimes also phototherapy. Such proceedings have proven short-term and long-term effectiveness, and they may also have beneficial effect in drug resistant depression. Among the therapeutic mechanisms of the sleep deprivation treatment, the following are influenced: catecholaminergic, serotonergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission, neurotrophic factors (mainly the brain-derived neurotrophic factor - BDNF), the immune system, the endocrine system, metabolism of some brain structures (mostly the prefrontal cortex) and gene expression related to biological clock.

Academic medical centers that value excellent clinicians may have the best chance to recruit and retain these faculty members. When our institution hoped to launch the Miller Coulson Academy of Clinical Excellence to measure and reward master clinicians, a critical first step was to use rigorous methods to develop a definition of clinical excellence. Published papers have illustrated that this general definition of clinical excellence is applicable to fields of psychiatry, cardiology, and pediatrics. In this manuscript, we apply the definition of clinical excellence to nephrology. Using the same framework, we reviewed the literature to find clinical cases and exemplary nephrologists that highlight the specific domains. This collection of reports in nephrology illustrates that the definition of clinical excellence set forth by the Miller Coulson Academy is highly applicable to physicians caring for individuals with kidney disease. Relating the definition of clinical excellence to renal medicine is worthwhile in that it can help to exemplify the model to which physicians and trainees may seek to aspire.\nMany examples of clinical excellence in renal medicine can be found in the published medical literature.

Criteria-based content analysis (CBCA) is the main component of the statement validity assessment (SVA), which is the most frequently used approach in this setting. This study investigated the inter-rater reliability (IRR) of CBCA in a forensic context. Three independent raters evaluated the transcripts of 95 statements of sexual abuse. IRR was calculated for each criterion, total score, and overall evaluation. The IRR was variable for the criteria, with several being unsatisfactory. But high IRR was found for the total CBCA scores (Kendall's W=0.84) and for overall evaluation (Kendall's W=0.65). Despite some shortcomings, SVA remains a robust method to be used in the comprehensive evaluation of children's statements of sexual abuse in the forensic setting. However, the low IRR of some CBCA criteria could justify some technical improvements."}, {"Title": "Psychopathic traits in adolescents are associated with higher structural connectivity.", "Abstract": "Altered structural connectivity has been reported in antisocial juveniles, but findings have been inconsistent. Given the phenotypical heterogeneity among individuals showing antisocial behavior, specification of the association between structural connectivity and the dimensions of psychopathic traits (i.e., callous-unemotional, grandiose-manipulative, and impulsive-irresponsible traits) may aid in more reliably elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying antisocial behavior during adolescence. In this study, a sample of 145 adolescents (mean age 17.6, SD 1.6) from a childhood arrestee cohort participated in a neuroimaging protocol including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD), as obtained by tract-based spatial statistics, were associated with juveniles' scores on the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory. Grandiose-manipulative traits were positively associated with FA and negatively with RD in a wide range of white matter tracts, suggesting abnormal myelination related to these traits. Callous-unemotional traits were positively associated with FA and AD in specific white matter tracts, including the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract. The differential associations between dimensions of psychopathic traits and measures of structural connectivity support the notion that multiple distinct neural mechanisms underlie antisocial and psychopathic development."}, {"Title": "The self-harm inventory: A meta-analysis of its relationship to the personality diagnostic questionnaire-4 as a measure of borderline personality disorder.", "Abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to further examine the efficacy of the Self-Harm Inventory (SHI) as a proxy measure in diagnosing borderline personality disorder, with the comparison measure being the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4 (PDQ-4).\nWe undertook a meta-analysis of data from our previous studies of psychiatric inpatients (N = 270) and internal medicine outpatients (N = 2587), all of whom completed both the SHI and the PDQ-4.\nScores on the SHI and PDQ-4 were strongly correlated, especially after correcting for attenuation due to measurement unreliability (0.78 in the compiled inpatient psychiatry sample and 0.83 in the compiled internal medicine sample).

The FEP group had significantly lower serum BDNF levels (2.0 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL) compared with the control group (3.4 \u00b1 3.0 ng/mL, P = 0.03). There was no significant relationship between BDNF concentration and the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (positive and negative scores) scores (r = -0.14, P = 0.74 and r = 0.49, P = 0.22, respectively). There was no significant relationship between the duration of untreated psychosis and serum BDNF levels (r = -0.22, P = 0.32).\nHigh incidence of schizophrenia in patients with FEP suggests a relationship between BDNF levels and the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

The autonomic nervous system can significantly compromised by use of chemical irritants.\nA cross-sectional hospital based study was conducted in which 33 patients (mean age: 29.94 years) of depression/anxiety were compared with 37 age matched controls (mean age: 28.10). The patients who were diagnosed as either depressed or anxious by the psychiatry were included in the study group by random sampling. Out of these 8 patients gave positive history of odour use. Thirty seven age matched healthy persons were taken as controls. Grading of patients was done according to DSMV-IV criteria and short- term HRV was recorded. Five minute HRV recording was done and time domain and frequency domain indices of HRV were assessed using RMS Polyearite D. The result in case and control groups was compared.\nWe have reported a poor HRV compared to control group in patients of depression/anxiety as reflected by NN50 values (p< 0.05). Although not significant the trend shows a better HRV control in almost all the time domain and frequency domain parameters in controls compared to cases. Regarding the history of use of chemical irritants the trend showed a poor HRV control in these cases compared to the patients who did not give any such history.\nOur results suggest that impaired cardiac autonomic nerve function characterized by sympathetic over activity may occur in depression/phobic patients.

Most patients did not change their previous music preference; this group of patients considered music helpful for their mental state, showed more attractivity and enforcement as personality traits and used music more for emotion modulation. Patients who experienced a preference shift reported that music had impaired them during the time of illness; these patients showed less ego-strength, less confidence and less enforcement and used music less for arousal modulation. A third subgroup stopped listening to music completely after the onset of the mental disorder; these patients attribute less importance to music and also reported that music had impaired their mental state. They showed more ego-strength and used music less for emotion modulation. The results suggest that the use of music in everyday life can be helpful as an emotion modulation strategy. However, some patients might need instructions on how to use music in a functional way and not a dysfunctional one. Psychiatrists and psychotherapists as well as music therapists should be aware of emotion modulation strategies, subjective valence of music and personality traits of their patients. Due to the ubiquity of music, psychoeducative instructions on how to use music in everyday life plays an increasing role in the treatment of mental illness."}, {"Title": "A collaborative strategy to improve geriatric medical education.", "Abstract": "Age-related demographic change is not being matched by a growth in relevant undergraduate medical education, in particular communication skills pertinent to elderly patients.

One hundred and twenty-nine students returned feedback forms with 104 forms matched for individual performance before and after the session. Feedback forms assessed student-perceived confidence in communicating with patients with dementia before and after the session using a 4-point Likert scale with corresponding numerical value (low (1), medium (2), high (3), very high (4)).\nUsing the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test on the 104 matched forms, student-perceived confidence was higher post-teaching intervention (median = 2.75) than pre-intervention (median = 1.50). This difference was statistically significant with large effect size, Z = -8.47, P < 0.001, r = -0.59.

However, in the societies where it originated, mindfulness meditation is part of a larger system of Buddhist belief and practice with strong ethical and moral dimensions. Extracting techniques like mindfulness meditation from the social contexts in which they originate may change the nature and effects of the practice.

It is the first UK study which aims to quantify how much major, everyday and anticipated discrimination; lifetime and childhood trauma; and coping strategies for dealing with unfair treatment, predict excess mental ill health among non-heterosexuals. Further, inner city and national outcomes are compared.\nSelf-report survey data came from the South East London Community Health study (N = 1052) and the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (N = 7403).\nAdjustments for greater exposure to measured experiences of discrimination and lifetime and childhood trauma had a small to moderate impact on effect sizes for adverse health outcomes though in fully adjusted models, non-heterosexual orientation remained strongly associated with CMD, lifetime suicidal ideation, harmful alcohol and drug use. There was limited support for the hypothesis that measured coping strategies might mediate some of these associations. The inner city sample had poorer mental health overall compared with the national sample and the discrepancy was larger for non-heterosexuals than heterosexuals.\nChildhood and adult adversity substantially influence but do not account for sexual orientation-related mental health disparities. Longitudinal work taking a life course approach with more specific measures of discrimination and coping is required to further understand these associations. Sexual minorities should be considered as a priority in the design and delivery of health and social services."}, {"Title": "Problems with sickness certification tasks: experiences from physicians in different clinical settings.

Darwinian psychiatry can formulate a definition of mental disorder that is value free and based on factual criteria. From an evolutionary perspective, genuine mental disorders are maladaptive conditions. The ultimate function of an adaptation is gene propagation via maximization of survival and reproduction. It follows that a distressing and/or disabling psychological or behavioral syndrome is a psychiatric disorder only if it impacts negatively on the individual's inclusive fitness. However, in many cases, an evolutionary definition of disorder cannot be reconciled with current social values. Thus, clinicians adopting the evolutionary approach should conform to the prevailing trend of contemporary medicine and accept that their task is to be healers of the distressed, not watchdogs of biological adaptation. These pragmatic considerations do not minimize the scientific validity of the Darwinian definition of mental disorders. Probably, its major contribution to psychiatric theory is the elimination of the necessity to find a brain lesion or dysfunctional mechanism to validate the distinction between disorders and non-disorders."}, {"Title": "\"The Tools of Your Chants and Spells\": Stories of Madwomen and Indian Practical Healing.", "Abstract": "A longstanding trope in Indian psychiatry, and in popular representations of it, involves the efficacy of incantations and exorcism in healing afflictions of the mind, notably hysteria.

In this article, I explore the subtleties and implications of this recurrent knowledge paradigm. I argue that a particular arrangement-one in which difference is established through equivalence-undergirds the terms by which medicine comes to be viewed as a cultural encounter.

In this paper, we use a novel approach of deconstructing DSM diagnostic criteria, and using expert knowledge to inform feature selection for unsupervised machine learning. We are able to identify clusters of symptoms that stratify subjects with the same DSM disorders into cohorts with increased clinical and biological homogeneity.

Attitudes were generally positive, but variable. Among negative observations were that approximately 60% of respondents felt that a patient can be disadvantaged by being given a psychiatric label and 58% believed that emotions are difficult to handle. A considerable proportion (40%) of the respondents felt doctors other than psychiatrists were unable to identify psychiatric disorders.\nThis study's findings suggest that practitioners of alternative medicine have mixed views about mental illness, patients and treatment.

This is despite compatibilities with ideals of modern mental health care such as self-management and recovery-oriented practice, and growing policy-level interest. Psychiatric medication is a mainstay of mental health treatment, but there are known problems with prescribing practices, and service users report feeling uninvolved in medication decisions and concerned about adverse effects. SDM has potential to produce better tailoring of psychiatric medication to individuals' needs.\nThis conceptual review argues that several aspects of mental health care that differ from other health-care contexts (e.g. forms of coercion, questions about service users' insight and disempowerment) may impact on processes and possibilities for SDM. It is therefore problematic to uncritically import models of SDM developed in other health-care contexts. We argue that decision making for psychiatric medication is better understood in a broader way that moves beyond the micro-social focus of a medical consultation. Contextualizing specific medication-related consultations within longer term relationships, and broader service systems enables recognition of the multiple processes, actors and agendas that shape how psychiatric medication is prescribed, managed and used, and which may facilitate or impede SDM.\nA broad conceptualization of decision making for psychiatric medication that moves beyond the micro-social can account for why SDM in this domain remains a rarity.

Social factors and related psychological factors (including depression) thus appear to greatly affect chronic musculoskeletal pain. This suggests the need for measures that take these factors into account. Treatment for musculoskeletal pain at present is generally based on a biomedical model that has been used for many years in this field, and modern medical imaging technologies have been a high priority to support this model and treatment strategy. Under the concept of the biomedical model, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, channel blockers and opioid analgesics are generally used as pharmacotherapy to alleviate chronic pain. However, these drugs are commonly associated with problems such as adverse effects, drug dependency and drug abuse, and they must be used with care. Surgery may also be effective in treating certain diseases, but studies have shown that many patients suffer residual chronic pain even after such treatment. Besides, exercise therapy has been found to be effective in treating many different types of chronic pain. Lately, various countries have been launching interdisciplinary pain centers that use a multidisciplinary approach to treat chronic musculoskeletal pain. Treatment in these centers is provided by a team of specialists in anesthesiology, psychiatry and orthopedics as well as the relevant paramedical professionals.

Over the last two decades, however, there has been an increased focus on the development of antidepressants and antipsychotics on the part of the pharmaceutical industry, clinicians, and researchers, with a reduced interest in BDZs, in spite of their widespread clinical use. As a consequence, many psychiatric residents, medical students, nurses, and other mental health professionals might receive poor academic teaching and training regarding these agents, and have the false impression that BDZs represent an outdated chapter in clinical psychopharmacology. However, recent advances in the field, including findings concerning epidemiology, addiction risk, and drug interactions, as well as the introduction of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition with related diagnostic changes, strongly encourage an updated appraisal of the use of BDZs in clinical practice. During a recent thematic event convened with the aim of approaching this topic in a critical manner, a group of young Italian psychiatrists attempted to highlight possible flaws in current teaching pathways, identify the main clinical pros and cons regarding current use of BDZs in clinical practice, and provide an updated overview of their use across specific clinical areas and patient populations.

All patients of DP were assessed in the outpatient department of Psychiatry of a tertiary care hospital. Diagnosis of DP was made on detail clinical history and supporting clinical findings. All our primary cases had DP and the accompanying relatives of our patients had folie \u00e0 deux as they shared the belief of parasite infestation which was firm and persisted despite evidence to the contrary. The primary cases of delusional parasitosis responded well to oral risperidone.

In busy outpatient departments (OPDs), the issue of stigma is likely to be overlooked.\nWe carried out a cross-sectional study collecting data on an 8-item stigma scale from patients attending psychiatry and other OPDs of a Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital in an industrial township. Information was collected by face to face interview from 400 patients attending psychiatry OPD and 401 patients attending other OPDs. Validations of the scale were done by face, content, and construct validity. Reliability was appraised by Cronbach's alpha and Guttmann split-half coefficients. Significant differences in answers to the 8-item questionnaire were explored by Chi-square test for individual responses and Kruskal-Wallis test for difference in total stigma score.\nPatients attending psychiatry OPD consistently gave responses indicating a greater degree of perceived stigma than those attending OPD for somatic disorders. This difference was almost 3-4 times more on most of the items (P < 0.001). Among somatic disorders, stigma was highest (even higher than psychiatric disorders) among STDs, tuberculosis and leprosy patients among these and psychiatric disorders the score was almost 3 times more compared to other somatic disorders (P < 0.001). The scale demonstrated good face, content, and construct validity. Reliability was also very high with Cronbach's alpha coefficient and Guttmann split-half reliability coefficient 0.932 and 0.901 indicating very good internal consistency of the 8-item scale.\nStigma was higher among STD patients, tuberculosis, leprosy, and psychiatry patients as compared to patients suffering from somatic disorders. Assessment of stigma among these groups of patients can help in planning management and intervention to deal with stigma. This in turn can improve patient compliance."}, {"Title": "Personality disorder, emotional intelligence, and locus of control of patients with alcohol dependence.", "Abstract": "To assess personality disorder (PD), emotional intelligence (EI), and locus of control of alcohol dependent (AD) patients and its comparison with normal controls.\nBased on purposive sampling technique, 33 AD patients were selected from the De-Addiction Ward of Ranchi Institute of Neuro-Psychiatry and Allied Sciences (RINPAS) and 33 matched normal subjects were selected from Ranchi and nearby places. Both the groups were matched on various sociodemographic parameters, that is, age, gender, and socioeconomic level.

Subjects received methylphenidate. Time- and frequency-domain analyses of HRV, the Korean ADHD rating scale (K-ARS), and computerized ADHD diagnostic system were evaluated before treatment. After a 12-week period of medication administration, we repeated the HRV measurements and K-ARS rating.\nEighty-six subjects were initially enrolled and 37 participants completed the 12-week treatment and HRV measurements subsequent to the treatment. Significant correlations were found between the K-ARS inattention score and some HRV parameters. All of the HRV parameters, except the standard deviations of the normal-to-normal interval, very low frequency, and low frequency to high frequency, showed a significant positive correlation between baseline and endpoint measures in completers. High frequency (HF) and the square root of the mean squared differences of successive normal-to-normal intervals (RMSSD), which are related to parasympathetic vagal tone, showed significant decreases from baseline to endpoint.\nThe HRV test was shown to be reproducible. The decrease in HF and RMSSD suggests that parasympathetic dominance in ADHD can be altered by methylphenidate treatment. It also shows the possibility that HRV parameters can be used as psychophysiological markers in the treatment of ADHD."}, {"Title": "Neurology and psychiatry: waking up to opportunities of sleep. : State of the art and clinical/research priorities for the next decade.", "Abstract": "In recent years, evidence has emerged for a bidirectional relationship between sleep and neurological and psychiatric disorders. First, sleep-wake disorders (SWDs) are very common and may be the first/main manifestation of underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders. Secondly, SWDs may represent an independent risk factor for neuropsychiatric morbidities. Thirdly, sleep-wake function (SWF) may influence the course and outcome of neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review summarizes the most important research and clinical findings in the fields of neuropsychiatric sleep and circadian research and medicine, and discusses the promise they bear for the next decade. The findings herein summarize discussions conducted in a workshop with 26 European experts in these fields, and formulate specific future priorities for clinical practice and translational research. More generally, the conclusion emerging from this workshop is the recognition of a tremendous opportunity offered by our knowledge of SWF and SWDs that has unfortunately not yet entered as an important key factor in clinical practice, particularly in Europe. Strengthening pre-graduate and postgraduate teaching, creating academic multidisciplinary sleep-wake centres and simplifying diagnostic approaches of SWDs coupled with targeted treatment strategies yield enormous clinical benefits for these diseases."}, {"Title": "German wine in an American bottle: the spread of modern psychiatry in China, 1898-1949.", "Abstract": "Modern psychiatry was first introduced to mainland China around 1900 by Western missionaries.

Psychiatry employs the dialogic discourse of the DSM in a one-sided, positivistic manner by identifying what it considers universal mental disease entities stripped of their cultural context. In 1992 the editors of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders proposed to introduce possession into their revisions. A survey of the discussions about introducing 'possession' as a dissociative disorder to be listed in the DSM-IV indicates a missed epistemological break. Subsequently the editors of the DSM-5 politically 'recuperated' possession into its official discourse, without acknowledging the anarchic challenges that possession presents to psychiatry as a cultural practice."}, {"Title": "Sciences of the brain: The long road to scientific maturity and to present-day reductionism.", "Abstract": "When examined in a long-term perspective, brain sciences demonstrate certain conceptual consistencies as well as theoretical oppositions that have lasted for centuries, ever since Ancient Greece. The neurosciences have progressed more on the basis of technological than conceptual advances, and the constant recuperation of new techniques from other sciences have led to a continually reductionist view of the brain and its functions. In a different perspective, if not opposite to the reductionism, are the psychological constructs and those that constitute the functional unity of individuals, which are still mysterious. In fact, the gap between these two approaches has never been larger than it is now.

The aim was to test whether, in the training setting, it was possible for a cohesive group to form, such that trainees could make use of a Balint group experience.\nNine psychiatry trainees were offered three 90-minute Balint sessions and provided written feedback.\nThe trainees reported unanimously that group participation was a positive and worthwhile experience. They began to feel supported by their colleagues and experienced the method as an effective way to manage stress and anxiety. They reported that they experienced doctor-patient interactions in a different way, which appeared to correspond with a greater understanding of the patient's experience.\nThe pilot suggested that, within the public health training setting, a cohesive group could form such that trainees were able to make use of a Balint group experience. It suggested that this practice could be beneficial in managing the stresses, isolation and intense feelings of working with patients in this setting. The feedback indicated that the group helped trainees 'think differently' by fostering self-awareness and so furthered their development of psychodynamic skills."}, {"Title": "Psychiatrists and Their Role in an Integrative Approach to Sexual Problems.", "Abstract": "Sexuality is a unit part of humans that has been evaluated as several fragmented particles for years. Although many biomedical and psychosocial approaches have been developed in the field of sex, these approaches usually have not been led to the complete satisfaction of the patients. It seems that for a comprehensive evaluation and management of the sexual problems, the unity of sex should be respected and the biopsychosocial multilayer aspects of the sex should be apprehended. Psychiatry is a unique point that both biomedical and psychosocial sciences reach each other. Therefore, psychiatrists should play a critical role as a modulator in the multidisciplinary team for management of the sexual problems. In this regard, comprehensive training of psychiatrists is highly recommended. One of the primary steps could be developing the psychosexual fellowship."}, {"Title": "Alcohol, Cannabinoids, and Opioids Abuse and Dependence Among Psychiatric Inpatients.", "Abstract": "While substance abuse among psychiatric patients is a widely known problem in clinical practice, there is no local study about prevalence and co-occurrence of substance abuse in north of Iran.\nThe present study was designed to determine the frequency of smoking, alcohol, opioid and cannabinoid substances, and prescription medicines abuse or dependence among Psychiatric Inpatients.\nA cross-sectional 2-year case register study was conducted on all (n = 492) psychiatric inpatients of Zare Psychiatric Hospital in Sari located in north of Iran.

A survey in general practitioners and paediatricians.", "Abstract": "Primary care physicians (PCPs) play a key role in the initial assessment and management of children and adolescents with mental health problems. However, it is unclear whether current medical education curricula sufficiently equip PCPs for this task. The aim of this study was to investigate, which child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP)-related skills and knowledge PCPs say they require in their daily practice. A questionnaire was generated, employing a modified two-step Delphi approach. Besides socio-demographic items, the questionnaire contained 17 CAP-related knowledge items and 13 CAP-related skills items, which had to be rated by importance in daily practice. The questionnaire was distributed to 348 office-based paediatricians and 500 general practitioners (GPs) in Germany. The overall return rate was 51.3% (435/848). Regarding CAP-related knowledge, both paediatricians and GPs rated somatoform disorders and obesity as highly important for daily practice. Moreover, paediatricians also deemed regulatory disorders during infancy (e.g. crying, sleep disorders) as important, while GPs assessed knowledge on paediatric depression as relevant. For paediatricians and GPs, the most relevant CAP-related skills were communicating with children and adolescents and their parents. Additionally, paediatricians rated differentiating between non-pathologic and clinically relevant behaviour problems very relevant, while GPs considered basic psychotherapeutic skills essential. The CAP-related knowledge and skills perceived relevant for doctors in primary care differ from the majority of current medical school CAP curricula, which cover mainly typical, epitomic CAP disorders and are predominantly knowledge-oriented. Therefore, medical education in CAP should be amended to reflect the needs of PCPs to improve healthcare for children and adolescents with mental health problems."}, {"Title": "Idiopathic Basal Ganglia Calcification Presented with Impulse Control Disorder.", "Abstract": "Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), also referred to as Idiopathic Basal Ganglia Calcification (IBGC) or \"Fahr's disease,\" is a clinical condition characterized by symmetric and bilateral calcification of globus pallidus and also basal ganglions, cerebellar nuclei, and other deep cortical structures.

Work related to beliefs about mental disorders finds that laypeople treat mental disorders as if they do have causal essences, while clinicians do not-differences that may be attributable to expertise (Ahn, Flanagan, Marsh, & Sanislow, 2006). To test whether reduced beliefs in essences are indicative of an overall influence of expertise or a demonstration of a phenomenon specific to expertise in the mental health domain we compared beliefs about mental and medical disorders held by practicing physicians (n = 43; 19 primary care and 24 non-psychiatry specialists) and laypeople (n = 40). We found differences between these groups in beliefs held concerning the necessity of removing shared category features to effectively cure disorders. While laypeople endorsed the idea that the cause needed to be removed to cure both mental and medical disorders, this endorsement decreased with expertise. Primary care providers were less willing to endorse this for mental disorders than for medical disorders. Our results support the notion that the reduction of beliefs concerning the existence of essences is a unique effect of expertise in the mental health domain, and does not extend to other areas of expertise. In physicians, this reduction of essentialist beliefs was most evident in questions regarding treatment. Similarities and differences to the results from Ahn et al.

Full recovery is the main goal in the treatment of depressive episodes. Compared to clinical trials, observational studies of patients with depression in late life (DLL) show poorer prognoses in terms of response and remission. However, observational studies on the course of DLL are scarce. The aims of this study were to examine the course of DLL in terms of response, remission and symptom-specific changes as measured by the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and to explore which clinical variables were associated with the response and remission.\nThis is an observational, multicenter and prospective study of patients aged 60 years and older who were referred to treatment of depression in the department of old-age psychiatry at specialist health care services in Norway. The patients were evaluated with the MADRS at admission to and discharge from hospital. The mean, median, minimum and maximum values for days stayed in hospital were 68, 53, 16 and 301, respectively. Effect size (ES) was calculated to determine which MADRS symptoms changed most during the treatment. To assess the predictors for change in the MADRS score (continuous variable) and for remission and response (both dichotomous variables), regression models adjusting for cluster effects within center were estimated.\nOf 145 inpatients, 99 (68.3 %) had a response to treatment (50 % or more improvement of the MADRS score). Remission (MADRS score \u22649 at discharge) was experienced in 74 (51.0 %) of the patients. Of the individual MADRS items, \"reported sadness\" (ES =0.88) and \"lassitude\" (ES = 0.80) showed the greatest amount of improvement, and \"concentration difficulties\" (ES = 0.50) showed the least amount of improvement during treatment. Having a diagnosis of dementia was associated with a lower remission rate and less improvement in the MADRS score during the treatment. Poorer physical health was associated with a lower response rate. Having experienced previous episode(s) of depression was associated with a lower remission rate.\nRecurrent episodes of depression, poor somatic health and a diagnosis of dementia were found to be negative prognostic factors for the course of DLL.

The Limits of Transformation.", "Abstract": "Narrative medicine is predicated on the importance of narrative to human life. Although that in itself is not controversial, an extension of this principle that has sprung up in narrative psychiatry--namely, that by coming to imagine a different life story one can become a different person--ought to be. One reason one cannot remake one's life in the image of a story is that life is not to be mistaken for a story in the first place. The seminal study of psychotherapy, Persuasion and Healing, although recommending that the demoralized absorb more uplifting stories about themselves, appears to recognize some limit to the possibility of modeling life on story. The same study likens therapeutic stories to placebos, but as it happens, placebos themselves have their limits, alleviating symptoms but not curing or \"healing.\" In order for someone to become a different person through the agency of the placebo effect, it would have to be more robust than it is. The argument that life follows narrative is an ironic one for a discipline devoted to narrative to make, given the salience in the tradition of the novel, from Don Quixote forward, of works that explore the fallacies of that presumption. In keeping with its attention to narrative, this article challenges the use of a short story by Chitra Divakaruni as an illustration of the principles of narrative psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Allowing for Psychosis to be Approachable and Understandable as a Human Experience: A Role for the Humanities in Psychotherapy Supervision.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry and related mental health fields, in particular psychotherapy, have a long history of close ties with the humanities.

In this paper, we explore the potential of the reintroduction of the humanities, specifically novels and related literary genre, into the supervision of student clinicians working with clients who have psychosis. We believe that incorporation of novels and related literary genre into supervision can lead to unique and deepened understanding of the experience of psychosis, and can create an opportunity for a working therapeutic alliance.

Semi-structured interviews with mentally disordered offenders in England who were subject to a restriction order under the Mental Health Act 1983 (as amended by the Mental Health Act 2007) provided the empirical basis for this study. The offenders had a number of perspectives on the restriction order. Firstly, it was seen as a mechanism for identifying those suffering from a mental disorder and for providing appropriate treatment. Secondly, the restriction order was viewed as a form of disciplinary control through which societal norms might be internalised. Thirdly, it was seen as labelling offenders in a manner that was experienced as limiting and oppressive. A number of research participants were aware that the order acted to limit staff actions. These participants saw the order as a means by which they might shape the support that they received in order to further their own aims.A video abstract of this article can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwIwDI2sOTY&feature=youtu.be."}, {"Title": "Structured Walking and Chronic Institutionalized Schizophrenia Inmates: A pilot RCT Study on Quality of Life.", "Abstract": "Lifestyle moderate-intensity physical activity can lower the risk of over twenty chronic health conditions, whilst inactivity reduces daily functioning and physical health of individuals living with schizophrenia.

It is a crisis of its diagnostic systems despite - perhaps because - of the recurrent claims about the extent of diagnosable 'brain disorders'. It is a crisis of its explanatory systems despite - perhaps because - of its current wager on the brain as the ultimate locus for explanations of mental disorders. It is a crisis of its therapeutic capacities despite - perhaps because - more and more people are making use of its primary mode of intervention focussed on the brain - psychiatric drugs. In this editorial, I will suggest that this triple crisis of diagnosis, explanation and therapeutics arises from the dominant reductionist approaches to the role of neurobiology in psychiatry that priorities the analysis of brain mechanisms, at the expense of an understanding of the whole living organism in its milieu, and the processes which social experience shapes neurobiology from the moment of conception if not before. I shall suggest a different approach that starts from the experience of persons coping with adversity in their forms of life. This approach does not require giving up on our search for plausible explanations of mental health problems that engage neurobiological mechanisms, but it begins from a commitment to understanding, and hence intervening in, the ways in which social adversity shapes and blights the lives of so many of our fellow citizens."}, {"Title": "New Investigator and Trainee Task Force Survey on the Recruitment and Retention of Headache Specialists.", "Abstract": "We sought to survey the New Investigators and Trainees Section (NITS) members of the American Headache Society (AHS) to better understand their exposure to headache medicine during training and to determine their perceptions and attitudes about the field and the future of headache medicine.\nDespite the high prevalence of headache disorders in the general population, only about 2% of neurology residents pursue headache medicine fellowships. Furthermore, there is a paucity of United Council of Neurologic Subspecialties headache specialists in the country to meet the population demands. Thus, there needs to be a focus on how to recruit and retain more headache specialists.\nA survey was distributed via SurveyMonkey to the NITS listserv. It remained online for 60 days, during which reminder emails were sent to members of the listserv. In addition, the survey was available on laptops at NITS-related events at an annual AHS meeting. Descriptive analyses were then conducted using SurveyMonkey and Excel.\nOf the 93 members of NITS, 64 of the 96 (68.8%) clicked to initiate the survey and 52.7% successfully completed it. Attendings made up the majority of respondents (62.5%), followed by fellows (10.9%), and residents (7.8%). Key highlights of the survey included the following: just under 10% reported no exposure to a headache center during any time in their training (medical school, residency, or fellowship); less than 2% had exposure to a headache center during medical school; less than half of participants reported exposure to a headache center in residency (45.3%) and during fellowship (43.4%). Having a mentor in the field, liking the patient population, and working in a headache center, 64.7%, 52.9%, and 41.2%, respectively, were the top ways in which participants became interested in headache. The journal Headache (56.9%), attendings (56.3%), and the AHS/American Academy of Neurology guidelines for migraine management (52.0%) are the resources cited as being used all/most of the time. About 82.4% strongly agree that there needs to be improved headache education for physicians of all specialties (primary care, emergency department, psychiatry); 84.4% feel that they are appreciated by their patients; 68.6% feel that there is strong support in their departments for headache; 56.9% believe that their work schedule leaves enough time for personal and family life; and 60.8% agreed that their professional life will improve in years to come. Participants agreed/strongly agreed that they like to treat the following diseases/symptoms: migraine headache (98.0%), cluster headache (92%), chronic daily headache (84%), and post-concussive syndrome (71.4%).

Young headache specialists appear positive about their field of medicine. These specialists like to treat various headache types but not necessarily some of the related comorbidities (sleep disorders, depression, anxiety, back pain, and dizziness).

The pooled prevalence of OCD in BD was 17.0% (95% CI 12.7-22.4%), which was comparable to the results reported by the pooled prevalence of BD in OCD (18.35%, 95% CI 13.2-24.8%). With regard to OCD-BD predictors, a higher mean age predicted a lower prevalence of OCD in BD patients. Sub group meta-analyses reported higher OCD prevalence rates in BD children and adolescents (24.2%, compared to 13.5% in adults), in BD-I patients (24.6%, compared to 13.6% in mixed BD patients), and among population-based studies (22.2%, compared to 13.2% in hospital-based studies).\nMost studies use retrospective assessment scales with low sensitivity in discriminating true ego-dystonic obsessions from depressive ruminations that may bias results towards an overestimation of obsessive symptom prevalence.\nThis first systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence and predictors of comorbid BD-OCD confirms that BD-OCD comorbidity is a common condition in psychiatry with children and adolescents and BD-I patients as the most affected subgroups."}, {"Title": "\"The Glamour of Arabic Numbers\": Pliny Earle's Challenge to Nineteenth-Century Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "A well-established interpretation associates the nineteenth-century psychiatrist Pliny Earle's deflation of high cure rates for insanity with the onset of a persistent malaise in patient treatment and public health policy during the Gilded Age.

Psychiatrists have contributed to the genetics field by defining the most important behavioral characteristics and by studying the association between genetic variants and behavioral differences within phenotypically well-characterized samples in which detailed assessments have been collected (e.g. neuroimaging). These samples are typically limited in size and are therefore not suitable for a genome-wide association analysis. Instead, gene association studies conducted in such samples typically focus on a few genes of interest, allowing smaller sample sizes. However, the selection of high-priority genes is not always straightforward and psychiatrists will usually have a limited background in genetics. We aim to fill this gap by (i) providing a basic introduction to genetics; (ii) showing how the selection of genes of interest can be optimized by the use of two web tools: Polysearch and Gene Prospector; (iii) illustrating how statistical power analyses can be performed and discussing the importance of sufficiently powered studies.

Despite the high heritability of depression and a clear genetic contribution to the disease, the identification of genetic risk factors for depression has been very difficult. The first published candidate to reach genome-wide significance in depression was SLC6A15, a neuronal amino acid transporter. With a reported 1,42 fold increased risk of suffering from depression associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a regulatory region of SLC6A15, the polymorphism was also found to affect hippocampal morphology, integrity, and hippocampus-dependent memory. However, the function of SLC6A15 in the brain is so far largely unknown. To address this question, we investigated if alterations in SLC6A15 expression, either using a full knockout or a targeted hippocampal overexpression, affect hippocampal neurochemistry and consequently behavior. We could show that a lack of SLC6A15 reduced hippocampal tissue levels of proline and other neutral amino acids. In parallel, we observed a decreased overall availability of tissue glutamate and glutamine, while at the same time the basal tone of extracellular glutamate in the hippocampus was increased. By contrast, SLC6A15 overexpression increased glutamate/glutamine tissue concentrations. These neurochemical alterations could be linked to behavioral abnormalities in sensorimotor gating, a key translational endophenotype relevant for many psychiatric disorders. Overall, our data supports SLC6A15 as a crucial factor controlling amino acid content in the hippocampus, thereby likely interfering with glutamatergic transmission and behavior. These findings emphasize SLC6A15 as pivotal risk factor for vulnerability to psychiatric diseases."}, {"Title": "Individual differences in hedonic experience: Further evidence for the construct validity of the ACIPS.", "Abstract": "We conducted three investigations to examine the convergent and discriminant validity of the Anticipatory and Consummatory Interpersonal Pleasure Scale (ACIPS; Gooding and Pflum, Psychiatry Research, 2014). In Study One, we used Mechanical Turk to individually administer the ACIPS to a diverse group of community adults aged 25-69. Reports of greater social/interpersonal pleasure was associated with greater sense of interpersonal connectedness with others, higher need to belong, and less likelihood of reporting anxiety during social interactions. In Studies Two and Three, participants were tested in group settings. Studies with undergraduate participants indicated that ACIPS scores are associated with measures of prosocial interactions and sociability as well as measures of anhedonia. Despite differences in testing conditions (i.e., online vs. paper administration) and heterogeneity in the samples in terms of educational level, geographical location, and age, the ACIPS demonstrated good convergent and discriminant validity.

A survey was conducted to study the current practice of ECT in US prisons. We hypothesize that ECT is underutilized in the correctional setting. We also review the ethical aspects of using ECT for the treatment of mental illness in the prison population.\nA 12-question survey via a Survey Monkey link was emailed to chiefs of psychiatry, or the equivalent, of each state's department of corrections. We examined the frequency of Likert-type responses, tabulated individual comments for qualitative review, and grouped for comparison.\nEmail contacts for chiefs of psychiatry, or the equivalent, for the department of corrections in 45 states (90%) were obtained and a survey link was sent. Thirty-one (68.9%) of 45 responded to the survey. Respondent estimates of the number of inmates with mental illness in 31 prison systems varied from less than 500 to more than 4500. Of these 31, 12 (38.7%) had more than 4500 inmates with mental illness. Four systems reported the use of ECT within the last 5 years. Of those, one reported use in the last 1 to 6 months, and 3 reported use in the last 2 to 5 years. Of these 4 prison systems, all felt that they had up to 10 patients who would benefit if ECT continued to be offered or became available in the future. None of these systems provided ECT within the prison. The inmates were referred to a local state psychiatric facility, a university hospital, or other institutions. The reasons for not using ECT as reported by the respondents are grouped under subheadings of stigma, ethical concerns, logistical concerns, and others.\nConsidering the high prevalence of mental illness in prisons, one might expect a high prevalence of ECT responsive mental illness and, hence, provision of ECT to some prisoners with mental illness. However, our survey suggests that the use of ECT in prisons in the United States is low. Stigma, ethical concerns, and logistical concerns were the main hindrances for providing ECT to prisoners with mental illness. Given that ECT is the standard of care in certain clinical scenarios, physicians are obligated to offer such treatment to inmates when necessary. It can be argued that failure of the prison to offer the standard of care is unethical and unconstitutional."}, {"Title": "Neuroligin-2 and the tightrope of excitation/inhibition balance in the prefrontal cortex.", "Abstract": "Excitation/inhibition imbalance is implicated in symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Clinical accounts describe avoidance strategies including apparently strategic use of distraction or socially shocking behaviour, and obsessive need for control, reflected in domineering behaviour to peers and adults. Educational and management approaches effective for PDA reportedly differ from those for 'typical' autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and include novelty, humour and flexibility. Identification of PDA in individuals with ASD may have important implications for management (Eaton and Banting, J Learn Disabil Offending Behav 3:150-157, 2012). Despite increasing interest, no clinician-rated instrument for PDA has been developed. Here, items relevant to PDA were identified from the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorder (DISCO) (Wing et al., J Child Psychol Psychiatry 43:307-325, 2002). The most PDA-specific subset of relevant DISCO items was selected, based on low endorsement in general across a sample of 153 individuals assessed for possible ASD using the DISCO. Having selected 11 DISCO PDA items for the measure, a subset of individuals with a high number of these features was identified (N = 27). Consistent with Newson's descriptions, this high scoring group was characterised by lack of co-operation, use of apparently manipulative behaviour, socially shocking behaviour, difficulties with other people, anxiety and sudden behavioural changes from loving to aggression. All but one case met criteria for an ASD. This study brings the field a step closer to a clinician-rated measure of PDA features and highlights the need for further elucidation of the PDA phenotype."}, {"Title": "Traumatic brain injury and bipolar psychosis in the Genomic Psychiatry Cohort.", "Abstract": "Approximately three million individuals in the United States sustain traumatic brain injury (TBI) every year, with documented impact on a range of neurological and psychiatric disturbances including mania, depression, and psychosis. Identification of subsets of individuals that may demonstrate increased propensity for posttraumatic symptoms and who may share genetic vulnerabilities for gene-environment interactions can enhance efforts to understand, predict, and prevent these phenomena. A sample of 11,489 cases from the Genomic Psychiatry Cohort (GPC), a NIMH-managed data repository for the investigation of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, was used for this study. Cases were excluded if TBI was deemed causal to their mental illness. A k-means clustering algorithm was used to probe differences between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder associated with variables including onset age, hallucinations, delusions, head injury, and TBI. Cases were separated into an optimum number of seven clusters, with two clusters including all cases with brain injury. Bipolar disorder with psychosis and TBI were significantly correlated in one cluster in which 72% of cases were male and 99.2% sustained head injury. This cluster also carried the longest average period of unconsciousness. This study demonstrates an association of TBI with psychosis in a subset of bipolar cases, suggesting that traumatic stressors may have the ability to impact gene expression in a vulnerable population, and/or there is a heightened occurrence of TBI in individuals with underlying psychosis. Further studies should more closely examine the interplay between genetic variation in bipolar disorder and susceptibility to psychosis following TBI. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, {"Title": "[\"Should the staff's attitude towards the patients remain unchanged, I will not guarantee anything.\" Protest masculinity and coping of \"rebellious patients\" at the Heidelberg University Psychiatric Hospital on the eve of deinstitutionalization].", "Abstract": "This article analyses the illness experiences of male patients from the Heidelberg University Psychiatric Hospital during the protests against Psychiatry in the year 1973. Protest is one of the most important expressions of masculinity in socially disadvantaged men, such as men with mental disorders. The analysis of 100 medical records shows that some patients tried to construct themselves as men in a way that was explicitly motivated by antipsychiatric ideas: They questioned psychiatric authority, behaved \"sexually inappropriate\", or used drugs. On the eve of psychiatric reform in West Germany those patients were well aware that the alternative--complying with the treatment--would put them at considerable risk. In addition to the usual inference of hegemonic or normative masculinities as risk-factors, the behavior of those ,,rebellious patients\" has to be interpreted as individual coping strategies."}, {"Title": "Immune and neurotrophin stimulation by electroconvulsive therapy: is some inflammation needed after all?", "Abstract": "A low-grade inflammatory response is commonly seen in the peripheral blood of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients, especially those with refractory and chronic disease courses. However, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), the most drastic intervention reserved for these patients, is closely associated with an enhanced haematogenous as well as neuroinflammatory immune response, as evidenced by both human and animal studies. A related line of experimental evidence further shows that inflammatory stimulation reinforces neurotrophin expression and may even mediate dramatic neurogenic and antidepressant-like effects following exposure to chronic stress. The current review therefore attempts a synthesis of our knowledge on the neurotrophic and immunological aspects of ECT and other electrically based treatments in psychiatry. Perhaps contrary to contemporary views, we conclude that targeted potentiation, rather than suppression, of inflammatory responses may be of therapeutic relevance to chronically depressed patients or a subgroup thereof."}, {"Title": "Clinical Skills Assessment: The Effects of Moving Certification Requirements Into Neurology, Child Neurology, and Psychiatry Residency Training.", "Abstract": "A few years ago, when the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology decided to phase out the patient-based oral examinations in its 3 primary specialties, requirements for assessing clinical skills during residency training were instituted.\nThe purpose of this report is to describe the experiences of training program directors and graduates with these new credentialing requirements (labeled CSEs) as well as other effects on the specialties.\nSurveys were administered electronically in 2012 to all current neurology, child neurology, and psychiatry program directors, and to a convenience sample of graduates who applied for the 2012 certification examinations.\nResponse rates for graduates were similar across the 3 specialties but low (28%-33%).

The results indicated that the CSEs were usually administered early in training, were completed toward the end, were often passed on first attempt, generally took place during routine clinical assignments, were used to assess additional competencies, almost always included feedback to the residents, and did not often lead to remediation. Furthermore, the CSEs were perceived to be useful components in the assessment of clinical skills.\nThe results obtained from the early implementation of the CSEs suggest that they provide an opportunity to assess clinical skills with the additional benefit of feedback to trainees.

We begin by summarising the current state of knowledge regarding FTLD, including the recent discovery of FTLD-causative genetic mutations. Clinicopathological correlations in FTLD are subsequently discussed, while emphasising that clinical syndromes of FTD are dictated by the distribution of FTLD pathology in the brain. We then review a large number of cases with suspected and confirmed bvFTD that had previously been diagnosed with a primary psychiatric disorder. The clinical and neuroscientific implications of this overlap are discussed, focusing on the importance of early diagnosis for clinical and therapeutic reasons. We propose that largely due to the paucity of biomarkers for primary psychiatric disorders, and the limited use of FTLD-related biomarkers by psychiatrists at present, it is very difficult to separate patients with early bvFTD from those with primary psychiatric disorders based on clinical grounds. Furthermore, specific limitations of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) 5 criteria for bvFTD may inadvertently discourage recognition of bvFTD in mental health settings. Clinically, more research is needed to develop tools that allow early differentiation of bvFTD from primary psychiatric disease, as bvFTD therapies will likely be most effective in the earliest stages of disease. From a neuroscience perspective, we argue that bvFTD provides an excellent paradigm for investigating the neural basis of psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Adverse drug reactions in a psychiatric department of tertiary care teaching hospital in India: Analysis of spontaneously reported cases.", "Abstract": "The epidemiological data are limited for the spontaneous adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting system in psychiatry and its comparison with intensive monitoring studies in terms of causative drugs, seriousness, preventability and drug interactions.

Prior to watching the video recording, participants were randomly allocated to one of three conditions with written information including the following: (1) her personal details and general background; (2) the addition of a behavioural description consistent with BPD; and (3) the further addition of a 'label' (past BPD diagnosis).\nThe BPD label was associated with more negative ratings of the woman's problems and her prognosis than both information alone and a behavioural description of BPD 'symptoms'.\nRegardless of potential actuarial value of such diagnoses, it is concluded that clinicians can be overly influenced by past diagnostic labels in the context of an apparent current comorbid problem, although such biases appear to be less likely if a description of the relevant behaviours is used instead. Thus, the label, rather than the behaviour it denotes, may be stigmatizing in mental health professionals.\nDiagnostic labels can have an inappropriately negative effect on clinicians' judgements not only of treatment variables such as engagement and response but also risk issues and interpersonal effectiveness. Diagnostic labels can have a greater effect on clinicians' judgements than a behavioural description or clinical presentation. Clinicians should therefore be cautious both in the use of diagnostic labels to describe patients and ensure that these are still valid, and also be mindful of the influence that such labels can have on their own clinical judgements and constantly seek to challenge these. Behavioural descriptions of difficulties are less likely to result in such negative judgements and predictions."}, {"Title": "Teaching Collaborative Care in Primary Care Settings for Psychiatry Residents.", "Abstract": "Job descriptions for psychiatrists will change significantly over the next decade, as psychiatrists will be called on to work as caseload consultants to the primary care team.\nThe purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effects of an American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training-approved collaborative care curriculum on caseload consulting skills among psychiatry residents.\nIn 2014, 46 psychiatry residents (5 postgraduate year 1s, 10 postgraduate year 2s, 22 postgraduate year 3s, and 9 postgraduate year 4s) from 5 academic psychiatry residency programs in the New England area were given the 2-hour pilot collaborative care curriculum.

However, few studies have investigated these aspects of CKD in pediatric pre-dialysis CKD patients. Therefore, we have analyzed resilience, QoL and anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents with pre-dialysis CKD and compared these to the values of healthy controls.\nDemographic and clinical data were collected from 28 children and adolescents with pre-dialysis CKD and 28 healthy sex- and age-matched controls. Psychological assessment of the participants was performed using the Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale, Pediatric Quality of Life (QoL) Inventory 4.0 , Child Depression Inventory and Self-report for Childhood Anxiety Related Disorders scales.\nOf the 56 children enrolled in our study, the CKD patients were referred to mental health professionals more frequently than the controls. Patients exhibited higher scores for separation anxiety and a higher frequency of clinically significant depressive symptoms. They also had lower overall QoL scores, as well as poorer scores for the psychological, educational and psychosocial subdomains of QoL instruments. There was a negative correlation between anxiety and depressive symptoms and all domains of QoL. Resilience was similar in both groups, but lower in patients with significant depressive symptoms. No significant association was found between clinical or laboratory findings and psychological variables in CKD patients.\nAlthough patients and controls exhibited similar scores of resilience, CKD negatively impacted the QoL of pediatric patients, contributing to a higher frequency of depression and separation anxiety."}, {"Title": "[A new classification for better care.

The primary focus of RDoC is on neural circuitry, with levels of analyses that span from molecules to behavior. There has been some concern that the RDoC framework is reductionist, with an overemphasis on neural circuits and genetics; however, the briefly reviewed, burgeoning literature on neuroplasticity and epigenetics highlights that this concern is unwarranted, as one cannot study neural circuits and genetics without considering experience.\nThe study of maltreated children has a number of advantages for the RDoC project, including the following: study of a subset of patients who are often not responsive to standard interventions; examination of a relatively homogenous sample with onset of psychopathology proposed to be associated with stress-related mechanisms; and well-established, relevant animal models to facilitate translational research."}, {"Title": "Personality disorders and the DSM-5: Scientific and extra-scientific factors in the maintenance of the status quo.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to review and discuss the evidence for dimensional classification of personality disorders and the historical and sociological bases of psychiatric nosology and research.\nCategorical and dimensional conceptualisations of personality disorder are reviewed, with a focus on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-system's categorisation and the Five-Factor Model of personality.

The present study investigated the factors that are related to choosing and rejecting medical specialties in a group of students and recent medical doctors.\nA cross-sectional survey of 1,223 medical students and doctors was performed in Brazil in 2012. A standardized literature-based questionnaire was applied that gathered preferable or rejected specialties, and asked questions about extracurricular experiences and the influence of 14 factors on a Likert-type scale from 0 to 4. Specialties were grouped according to lifestyle categories: controllable and uncontrollable, which were subdivided into primary care, internal medicine, and surgical specialties. Notably, the time period of rejection was usually earlier than the time period of intended choice (p < 0.0001, \u03c7(2) = 107.2). The choice mainly occurred during the internship period in medical school (n = 466; 38.7%).

The data were collected from the \"Hungarian Museum of Mind\" opened for the public in 1931. It focuses on the collecting policy and the research topics of Hungarian psychiatrists working in the asylums in those days. In 2007 Lipotmezo (the Hungarian Psychiatric and Neurological Institution the biggest Hungarian asylum since its foundations in 1868) was closed. Its art collection was rescued by the Hungarian Academy of Science. From 2007 this collection has been named The Psychiatric Art Collection of the HAS, maintained by The Research Centre for the Humanities of the Hungarian Academy of Science. The artistic objects and documents are properly stored and available for research. Two art historians are in charge of curating the exhibitions and leading the research on the psychiatric art in the context of history, psychiatric history and contemporary culture. This work follows the well established practice of the eighties and nineties when the art historian Edit Plesznivy expert in this subject listed the pieces of this historical collection, and through the context of outsider art and art therapy she channeled it into the field of art institutions. Leaving the hospital environment and having been introduced to the academic world the research is looking toward the collection has been changed and new perspectives have been opened. Beside the art works of the patients living as inmates in mental hospitals, the collecting work and therapeutic practices of the mental physicians became a significant research topic also. Arpad Selig as an assistant physician at the Mental and Neurological Clinic in Lipotmezo started to collect the patients' works of art in the first decade of twentieth century. During the 1920s he was appointed the director of Angyalfold Asylum found in 1883. Selig died in 1929 and the Museum of Mind named after its enthusiastic founder Selig was registered in the official list of museums in 1932. In the 1930s Istvan Zsako the physician director of Angyalfold Asylum took care of the collection. He enriched it with further historical documents on the institution, bibliographies, press cuts, tableaux and photographic albums referring to the institution and the research practiceses of the physicians. After Zsako was appointed the director of Lipotmezo the collections of Lipotmezo and Angyalfold were joined. The collection suffered during the World War II and this period is can be viewed as a caesura in the practice of collecting. Later, from the late fifties, the physician Fekete Janos, head of the nurse training in Lipotmezo was in charge of the collection. He focused on sorting and installation of the remnants and also collected new works of the inpatients. During the seventies the psychotherapy was inaugurated and in the eighties the art therapy exercises began. However, through the reconstruction of the therapeutical and collecting practices show that these evolving art therapy practices partly rooted in the work of psychiatric treatment in the twenties and thirties. Psychiatrists, who lived in the asylums too, supported the so called \"noble entertainments\" - including artistic drawing, painting, reading and playing musical instruments - and as a part of the daily routines of these mental institutions they formed a locally particular modus operandi of therapy. The inmates of the asylums, the physicians and patients cooperated to enrich the collection which was a venue to represent the life of the institution and to demonstrate the research of the physicians. Despite of the significant differences between the pre- and postwar periods concerning the sociocultural and political structures there is a well defined connection between \"curing and curating\"."}, {"Title": "Beliefs towards mental illness in Turkish physiotherapy students.", "Abstract": "Mental health is a new area of specialization for physiotherapists.

Although diagnosed by its characteristic motor manifestations, PD may be preceded, and is frequently accompanied, by a wide range of psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. These symptoms are often more debilitating than its motor complications and it is nowadays appreciated that they can be an important cause of excess disability in PD, frequently necessitating hospitalization and institutionalization. Despite their frequent occurrence, most PD-related neuropsychiatric symptoms remain under-recognized and undertreated in clinical practice and their diagnosis is challenging because of the overlap of the somatic features of the psychiatric disorders and the motor symptoms of PD. Even when identified, there is a common perception that many of these symptoms are untreatable. Their recognition is essential not only for ascertaining the functional status of patients but also for better appreciating the nature of the neurodegenerative process in PD. These symptoms may precede the onset of motor symptoms and can be used as screening tools allowing for very early disease identification and for trials of possible diseasemodifying interventions. The pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD involves complex and multifactorial mechanisms, including disease-related and psychological factors. Alterations in neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, involving subcortical projections and synaptic and neuronal changes involving limbic and cortical structures combine to result in these nonmotor symptoms. Potentially earlier evaluation and treatment of comorbid psychiatric and cognitive disorders in PD could improve quality of life and patient productivity, reduce morbidity and caregiver burden, and minimize healthcare costs. Management strategies include adjustment of dopaminergic medication, use of psychotropic treatments and behavioral and psychological interventions. Dopaminergic medication may precipitate neuropsychiatric conditions, such as the dopamine dysregulation syndrome. The choice of psychotropic medication for the neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD is determined by a balance between potential benefit versus side effects, mostly in terms of worsening motor symptoms. Furthermore, treatments used in general psychiatry services may not be as effective in PD. This article provides an overview and focuses on the neuropsychiatric manifestations in PD including depression, anxiety, psychosis, apathy and fatigue, personality, sexual dysfunction, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment and dementia, impulse control disorders and related behaviours. The epidemiology, pathophysiology and risk factors, clinical presentation and management of the most common neuropsychiatric complications in PD are discussed."}, {"Title": "Neural correlates of response inhibition in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A controlled version of the stop-signal task.", "Abstract": "The stop-signal task has been used extensively to investigate the neural correlates of inhibition deficits in children with ADHD.

The CDT plus recall predicted dementia and MCI in study 1 with optimal cutoff scores of \u2264 2 for dementia (sensitivity=0.87, specificity=0.85) and \u2264 3 for MCI (sensitivity=0.62, specificity=0.62). Higher RCS scores were protective against nursing home placement and mortality. The RCS predicted dementia and MCI in study 2.\nThe 3-item RCS exhibits good sensitivity and specificity for the detection of MCI and dementia, and higher cognitive function on the RCS is protective against nursing home placement and mortality. The RCS may be a useful screening instrument for the detection of cognitive dysfunction in the primary care setting."}, {"Title": "[The most important obstacles of the development of Hungarian psychiatry].", "Abstract": "A quarter of a century ago the change of the political system in Hungary precipitated a serious value-crisis and caused a lot of harmful effects in nurturing and the development of psychiatry. The author establishes that the attack against psychiatry is more intensive than previously but neither the education and health management nor the psychiatric leadership could cope with these difficulties. It can't be denied that the foundation of lifelong mental health begins in the early life years and about 75% of the first Mental Disorder manifests in adolescence and youth. We are not able to ensure the special rights of every child according to the Hungarian Constitution and the Declaration of the Rights of the Child by the United Nations. The large inequalities within the country, the lack of paramount mental education and nurturing, the lack of essential, consistent eternal values, the lack of required psychiatric care system are huge obstacles of the development of healthy individual and leads to self-destructive behaviour and several, serious physical and mental disorders. The purpose of the author is to call psychiatrists' attention to the main obstacles of the development of Hungarian Psychiatric Care System. The main obstacles of the present psychiatric care system: 1. Unclarified notions, confusion of ideas. 2. Somatic, neurologic, mental, cultural-social and spiritual ignorance. 3. Lack of organization in Mental Education and Psychiatric Care System. 4. Value-crisis in our society despite the fact that the \"Council of Wise Men\" created a \"Scale of the Essential Consistent Eternal Values\" for the Hungarian Education System in 2008. 5. Lack of mental health prevention both in education system and health care system. There is no teaching of hygiene lessons in the Hungarian schools. 6. Negligence and selfishness among the population. 7. Disinterest among competent authorities. 8. Leaving the most important possibilities out of consideration. The author establishes that the elimination of the above mentioned obstacles, the high standard of psychiatric care system, - especially the child psychiatric care system - and paramount mental education are extraordinarily important to prevent most psychiatric disorders and help the development of healthy and happy people. If human individuals are the most important ones in our society, if we eliminate the main obstacles of the development of psychiatry, we ensure to improve Hungarian psychiatry again, we shall be able to say that \"the spiritual light is shining through the windows of every house\", and our work will not be a quixotic struggle or \"tilting at windmills\"."}, {"Title": "The neurology-psychiatry divide: a thought experiment.", "Abstract": "Diseases of the brain are generally classified as either neurological or psychiatric.

The length of stay was correlated with the time from admission to contact with the service (the referral lag (REFLAG)), and the REFLAG's proportion of length of stay (REFLAG/LOS) for all 140 in-patients, those with stays greater than 4 days, and for those under and over 65 years. Results The length of stay was significantly correlated with referral lag and logREFLAG/logLOS for all patients and for patients with stays greater than 4 days. The correlations remained significant for both age groups, but were stronger in the younger group. Clinical implications Timeliness of contact with CLP was associated with shorter length of stay, particularly in younger patients. Psychiatric factors influencing length of stay in older patients should be studied by CLP services."}, {"Title": "Quality assurance of approved out of programme psychiatry training and research over the past 5 years.", "Abstract": "Aims and method This paper intends to analyse the number of applications, trainee demographic and approval rate of those applying for out of programme training (OOPT) or out of programme research (OOPR) between January 2008 and April 2013 using the committee's anonymised database.

This legislation is open to interpretation, but it is affecting the way older people's services are defined and provided. Historical evidence indicates that, since the 1940s, apart from psychiatrists working in dedicated old age services, most were unenthusiastic about working with mentally unwell older people and unsupportive of those who chose to do so.

Another 52 inpatients completed a questionnaire assessing their views and experiences after the smoking ban. Before the totally smoke-free policy, 69.6% smoked, with 67.7% smoking more when admitted to the psychiatry ward. Before the smoking ban, 54.4% reported that the totally smoke-free policy would be 'negative' or 'very negative,' and 30.5% said it would be 'positive' or 'very positive.' After the totally smoke-free policy, 57.7% smoked heavily before hospital (mean cigarettes/day = 24.9), with consumption dramatically reducing following admission to a totally smoke-free psychiatric unit (mean cigarettes/day = 8.3). After the totally smoke-free policy, 36.5% reported that it was 'negative' or 'very negative,' and 50% reported that it was 'positive' or 'very positive.' Overall, inpatients reported improved acceptance of the policy following implementation.

We analyzed 2837 admissions with affective disorders hospitalized in the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw, between 2002 and 2010 (mania, n=380, mixed episode, n=131, bipolar depression, n=736, recurrent depression, n=681, single depressive episode, n=909). For each diagnostic group admission time series were created and categorized into subgroups according to sex and age, and these were analyzed by means of the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method. Regression models and correlations were used to assess the influence of the intensity of sunlight on the number of hospitalizations. Most mania admissions were noted in spring/summer months and in midwinter, mixed episode-late spring and winter, and depression (bipolar, recurrent and single depressive episode)-spring and autumn months. The association between frequency of admissions and monthly hours of sunshine was observed in some age and sex subgroups of patients with bipolar disorder and single depressive episode. The results support the seasonality of admissions of patients with affective disorders."}, {"Title": "Supraphysiological hormonal status, anxiety disorders, and COMT Val/Val genotype are associated with reduced sensorimotor gating in women.", "Abstract": "Pregnancy is a period characterized by a supraphysiological hormonal status, and greater anxiety proneness, which can lead to peripartum affective symptoms with dramatic consequences not only for the woman but also for the child. Clinical psychiatry is heavily hampered by the paucity of objective and biology-based intermediate phenotypes. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response, a neurophysiological measure of sensorimotor gating, has been poorly investigated in relation to anxiety and in pregnant women. In the present study, the PPI of healthy non-pregnant women (n = 82) and late pregnant women (n = 217) was investigated. Age, BMI, depression and anxiety symptoms, tobacco use, and antidepressant medication were considered. We investigated and provided evidence of lower PPI: (i) in healthy pregnant women compared to healthy non-pregnant controls, (ii) in pregnant women with anxiety disorders compared to healthy pregnant women, (iii) in pregnant women with anxiety disorders using SSRI compared to un-medicated pregnant women with anxiety disorders, and (iv) in healthy pregnant women carrying the COMT Val158Met Val/Val genotype compared to Met carriers. Altogether, a reduced sensorimotor gating as an effect of supraphysiological hormonal status, anxiety disorders, SSRIs, and catecholaminergic genotype, implicate the putative relevance of lower PPI as an objective biological correlate of anxiety proneness in pregnant women. These findings call for prospective studies to dissect the multifactorial influences on PPI in relation to mental health of pregnant women."}, {"Title": "The situation of former adolescent self-injurers as young adults: a follow-up study.", "Abstract": "Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) in adolescence has been described as comorbid condition in affective or anxiety disorders, as well as borderline personality disorder (BPD) and is a risk factor for later suicide attempts. Prevalence rates of NSSI decline steeply from adolescence to young adulthood. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, the longitudinal development of adolescent psychiatric patients with NSSI into their young adulthood has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to assess current NSSI and psychological impairment of young adults, who had been in treatment for NSSI in their adolescence.\nFormer patients of the departments of child and adolescent psychiatry and psychotherapy in Ulm and Ravensburg, Germany (N = 52), who presented with NSSI in their adolescence, were recruited (average age: 21.5 years (SD = 2.6)). Data was assessed using questionnaires and structured clinical interviews. Two groups of participants with prevailing NSSI and ceased NSSI were compared concerning their current psychological impairment, history of NSSI, suicide attempts, and BPD diagnosis.\nAround half of all participants had engaged in NSSI within the last year, and around half met diagnostic criteria for BPD. Although there was no significant association between current NSSI and BPD, an earlier age of onset of NSSI and a longer duration of NSSI during adolescence was significantly predictive of adult BPD. Two thirds of participants still met criteria of an axis 1 psychiatric disorder. Suicide attempts were reported by 53.8 % of all participants. Participants with current NSSI were more likely to meet criteria for a current axis 1 disorder, had engaged in NSSI more often in their lifetime, and reported more suicide attempts.\nReduction of NSSI from adolescence to young adulthood was lower than described in previous community samples. This may be due to the initial high psychiatric impairment of this sample in adolescence. Early onset of NSSI seemed to be a risk factor for a longer duration of NSSI during adolescence but not for NSSI prevailing into adulthood. However, it was a risk factor for adult BPD. Furthermore, the occurrence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors and prevailing NSSI was highly associated."}, {"Title": "When Assessing Intra-Familial Relationships, Are Sociologists, Psychoanalysts and Psychiatrists Really Considering Different Constructs?

An empirical study based on a mixed-method design collected the responses of 194 adolescents to the instruction \"In the next half hour, would you please write as freely as you wish about your relationships in your family, explaining how things are\". All answers were then analyzed and 18 dimensions related to 3 different theoretical frameworks were rated blind using numerical scores by two independent raters from each discipline. Inter-rater reliability was good. A parallel analysis evidenced a strong underlying factor explaining a large amount of variance (>50%). This factor is bipolar, it reflects the level of positivity/negativity in the adolescent's point of view concerning his/her intra-familial relationships. A second factor can marginally be considered (10% of the variance). The 2-factor analysis found one factor related to positive feelings and the other to negative feelings.

Text mining (TM) approaches are becoming essential to facilitate the automated extraction of useful biomedical information from unstructured text. We reviewed the applications of TM in psychiatry, and explored its advantages and limitations. A systematic review of the literature was carried out using the CINAHL, Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane databases. In this review, 1103 papers were screened, and 38 were included as applications of TM in psychiatric research. Using TM and content analysis, we identified four major areas of application: (1) Psychopathology (i.e. observational studies focusing on mental illnesses) (2) the Patient perspective (i.e. patients' thoughts and opinions), (3) Medical records (i.e. safety issues, quality of care and description of treatments), and (4) Medical literature (i.e. identification of new scientific information in the literature). The information sources were qualitative studies, Internet postings, medical records and biomedical literature. Our work demonstrates that TM can contribute to complex research tasks in psychiatry. We discuss the benefits, limits, and further applications of this tool in the future.

Putative mechanisms include heritable genetic factors, de novo mutations, and epigenetic mechanisms. Few studies have explored phenotypic features associated with APA. The Genomic Psychiatry Cohort established a clinically characterized repository of genomic samples from subjects with a Sz-BP diagnosis or unaffected controls, 12,975 with parental age information. We estimated relative risk ratios for Sz, schizoaffective depressed and bipolar types (SA-D, SA-B), and BP with and without history of psychotic features (PF) relative to the control group, comparing each paternal age group to the reference group 20-24 years. All tests were two-sided with adjustment for multiple comparisons. Subjects with fathers age 45+ had significantly higher risk for all diagnoses except for BP w/o PF. APA also bore no significant relation to family psychiatric history. In conclusion, we replicated APA as a risk factor for Sz. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of APA in a BP sample stratified by psychosis history, extending this association only in BP w/PF. This suggests that phenotypic expression of the APA effect in Sz-BP spectrum is psychosis, per se, rather than other aspects of these complex disorders. The lack of a significant relationship between paternal age and familial disease patterns suggests that underlying mechanisms of the paternal age effect may involve a complex interaction of heritable and non-heritable factors. The authors discuss implications and testable hypotheses, starting with a focus on genetic mechanisms and endophenotypic expressions of dopaminergic function. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, {"Title": "Identifying alternatives to old age psychiatry inpatient admission: an application of the balance of care approach to health and social care planning.", "Abstract": "Mental health problems in older people are common and costly, posing multiple challenges for commissioners. Against this backdrop, a series of initiatives have sought to shift resources from institutional to community care in the belief that this will save money and concurs with user preferences. However, most of this work has focused on the use of care home beds and general hospital admissions, and relatively little attention has been given to reducing the use of mental health inpatient beds, despite their very high cost.\nThe study employed a 'Balance of Care approach' in three areas of North-West England. This long-standing strategic planning framework identifies people whose needs can be met in more than one setting, and compares the costs and consequences of the possible alternatives in a simulation modelling exercise. Information was collected about a six-month cohort of admissions in 2010/11 (n\u2009=\u2009216). The sample was divided into groups of people with similar needs for care, and vignettes were formulated to represent the most prevalent groups. A range of key staff judged the appropriateness of these admissions and suggested alternative care for those considered least appropriate for hospital. A public sector costing approach was used to compare the estimated costs of the recommended care with that people currently receive.\nThe findings suggest that more than a sixth of old age psychiatry inpatient admissions could be more appropriately supported in other settings if enhanced community services were available. Such restructuring could involve the provision of intensive support from Care Home Outreach and Community Mental Health Teams, rather than the development of crisis intervention and home treatment teams as currently advocated. Estimated savings were considerable, suggesting local agencies might release up to \u00a31,300,000 per annum. No obvious trade-off between health and social care costs was predicted.\nThere is considerable potential to change the mix of institutional and community services provided for older people with mental health problems. The conclusions would be strengthened by further studies and the incorporation of evidence about relative outcomes. However, the utility of the approach in challenging established patterns of resource allocation and building local ownership for change is apparent."}, {"Title": "A task shifting mental health program for an impoverished rural Indian community.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric disorders constitute a major source of disability across the globe. In India, individuals with mental disorders are diagnosed and treated inadequately, particularly in under-served rural areas. We implemented and evaluated a psychiatric 'task shifting' program for a rural, marginalized, impoverished South Indian tribal community. The program was added to a pre-existing medical program and utilized community workers to improve health care delivery. Following community wide discussions, health workers were trained to provide community education and to identify and refer individuals with psychiatric problems to a community hospital. Subsequently, they also followed up the psychiatric patients to improve treatment adherence. The program was evaluated through medical records and community surveys. Treated patients experienced significant improvement in daily function (p=0.01). Mean treatment adherence scores remained stable at the beginning and end of treatment, overall. The proportion of self-referrals increased from 27% to 57% over three years. Surveys conducted before and after program initiation also suggested improved knowledge, attitudes and acceptance of mental illness by the community. The annual per capita cost of the program was 122.53 Indian Rupees per person per annum (USD 1.61). In conclusion, the community-driven psychiatric task shifting program was implemented successfully. It was accompanied by positive changes in knowledge, attitudes and practice. Initial community consultations and integration with a pre-existing medical program increased acceptance by the community and reduced costs.

By using a previously used reliable approach, we explored the frequency and extent of brain pathology in a large group of institutionalized offenders who had not previously been considered to be suffering from structural brain damage and compare it to healthy, non-offending subjects. MRI and CT brain scans from 148 male inpatients of a high-security mental health institution (offense type: 51 sex, 80 violent, 9 arson, and 8 nonviolent) that were obtained due to headache, vertigo, or psychological complaints during imprisonment were assessed and compared to 52 non-criminal healthy controls. Brain scans were assessed qualitatively with respect to evidence of structural brain damage. Each case received a semiquantitative rating of \"normal\" (=0), \"questionably abnormal\" (=1), or \"definitely abnormal\" (=2) for the lateral ventricles, frontal/parietal cortex, and medial temporal structures bilaterally as well as third ventricle. Forensic inpatients displayed signs of brain damage to a significantly higher degree than healthy controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Even after adjustment for age, in the patients, being younger than the controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), every offender type group displayed a higher proportion of subjects with brain regions categorized as definitely abnormal than the non-criminal controls. Within the forensic inpatients, offense type groups did not significantly differ in brain pathology. The astonishingly high prevalence of brain pathology in institutionalized inmates of a high-security mental health institution who previously had not been considered to be suffering from an organic brain syndrome raises questions on whether such neuroradiological assessment might be considered as a routine procedure in newly admitted patients. Furthermore, it highlights that organic changes, detectable under clinical routine conditions, may play a role in the development of legally relevant behavioral disturbances which might be underestimated."}, {"Title": "Dissemination of Evidence-Based Antipsychotic Prescribing Guidelines to Nursing Homes: A Cluster Randomized Trial.", "Abstract": "To evaluate the effectiveness of efforts to translate and disseminate evidence-based guidelines about atypical antipsychotic use to nursing homes (NHs).\nThree-arm, cluster randomized trial.\nNHs.\nNHs in the state of Connecticut.\nEvidence-based guidelines for atypical antipsychotic prescribing were translated into a toolkit targeting NH stakeholders, and 42 NHs were recruited and randomized to one of three toolkit dissemination strategies: mailed toolkit delivery (minimal intensity); mailed toolkit delivery with quarterly audit and feedback reports about facility-level antipsychotic prescribing (moderate intensity); and in-person toolkit delivery with academic detailing, on-site behavioral management training, and quarterly audit and feedback reports (high intensity).

Within a school, the sequence in which students complete these clerkships varies. In addition, the length of these rotations varies, both within a school for different clerkships and between schools for the same clerkship.\nThe present study investigated the effects of clerkship sequence and length on performance on the National Board of Medical Examiner's subject examination in internal medicine.\nThe study sample included 16,091 students from 67 US Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME)-accredited medical schools who graduated in 2012 or 2013.\nStudent-level measures included first-attempt internal medicine subject examination scores, first-attempt USMLE Step 1 scores, and five dichotomous variables capturing whether or not students completed rotations in family medicine, ob/gyn, pediatrics, psychiatry, and surgery prior to taking the internal medicine rotation. School-level measures included clerkship length and average Step 1 score.\nMultilevel models with students nested in schools were estimated with internal medicine subject examination scores as the dependent measure. Step 1 scores and the five dichotomous variables were treated as student-level predictors. Internal medicine clerkship length and average Step 1 score were used to predict school-to-school variation in average internal medicine subject examination scores.\nCompletion of rotations in surgery, pediatrics and family medicine prior to taking the internal medicine examination significantly improved scores, with the largest benefit observed for surgery (coefficient = 1.58 points; p value < 0.01); completion of rotations in ob/gyn and psychiatry were unrelated to internal medicine subject examination performance. At the school level, longer internal medicine clerkships were associated with higher scores on the internal medicine examination (coefficient = 0.23 points/week; p value < 0.01).\nThe order in which students complete clinical clerkships and the length of the internal medicine clerkship are associated with their internal medicine subject examination scores.

We describe the development of a serum biomarker test for the identification of individuals at risk of developing schizophrenia based on multiplex immunoassay profiling analysis of 957 serum samples. First, we conducted a meta-analysis of five independent cohorts of 127 first-onset drug-naive schizophrenia patients and 204 controls. Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, we identified an optimal panel of 26 biomarkers that best discriminated patients and controls. Next, we successfully validated this biomarker panel using two independent validation cohorts of 93 patients and 88 controls, which yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 (0.95-1.00) for schizophrenia detection. Finally, we tested its predictive performance for identifying patients before onset of psychosis using two cohorts of 445 pre-onset or at-risk individuals. The predictive performance achieved by the panel was excellent for identifying USA military personnel (AUC: 0.90 (0.86-0.95)) and help-seeking prodromal individuals (AUC: 0.82 (0.71-0.93)) who developed schizophrenia up to 2 years after baseline sampling. The performance increased further using the latter cohort following the incorporation of CAARMS (Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental State) positive subscale symptom scores into the model (AUC: 0.90 (0.82-0.98)). The current findings may represent the first successful step towards a test that could address the clinical need for early intervention in psychiatry. Further developments of a combined molecular/symptom-based test will aid clinicians in the identification of vulnerable patients early in the disease process, allowing more effective therapeutic intervention before overt disease onset."}, {"Title": "Overview of genetic research in anorexia nervosa: The past, the present and the future.", "Abstract": "Even though the evidence supporting the presence of a heritable component in the aetiology of anorexia nervosa (AN) is strong, the underlying genetic mechanisms remain poorly understood.

Portal adoption is increasing, and secure messaging between patients and healthcare providers is an emerging form of outpatient interaction. Research about portals and messaging has focused on medical specialties. We characterized adoption of secure messaging and the contribution of messaging to outpatient interactions across diverse clinical specialties after broad portal deployment.\nThis retrospective cohort study at Vanderbilt University Medical Center examined use of patient-initiated secure messages and clinic visits in the three years following full deployment of a patient portal across adult and pediatric specialties. We measured the proportion of outpatient interactions (i.e., messages plus clinic visits) conducted through secure messaging by specialty over time. Generalized estimating equations measured the likelihood of message-based versus clinic outpatient interaction across clinical specialties.\nOver the study period, 2,422,114 clinic visits occurred, and 82,159 unique portal users initiated 948,428 messages to 1,924 recipients. Medicine participated in the most message exchanges (742,454 messages; 78.3% of all messages sent), followed by surgery (84,001; 8.9%) and obstetrics/gynecology (53,424; 5.6%). The proportion of outpatient interaction through messaging increased from 12.9% in 2008 to 33.0% in 2009 and 39.8% in 2010 (p<0.001). Medicine had the highest proportion of outpatient interaction conducted through messaging in 2008 (23.3% of outpatient interactions in medicine). By 2010, this proportion was highest for obstetrics/gynecology (83.4%), dermatology (71.6%), and medicine (56.7%). Growth in likelihood of message-based interaction was greater for anesthesiology, dermatology, obstetrics/gynecology, pediatrics, and psychiatry than for medicine (p<0.001).\nThis study demonstrates rapid adoption of secure messaging across diverse clinical specialties, with messaging interactions exceeding face-to-face clinic visits for some specialties. As patient portal and secure messaging adoption increase beyond medicine and primary care, research is needed to understand the implications for provider workload and patient care."}, {"Title": "Yoga for schizophrenia: Patients' perspective.", "Abstract": "Yoga-based intervention is emerging as an effective add-on therapy in the management of schizophrenia.

Yet, in striking contrast, pharmacological treatment options presently available in child and adolescent psychiatry are dramatically limited. The most important currently unmet needs in paediatric psychopharmacology are: the frequent off-label prescription of medications to children and adolescents based exclusively on data from randomized controlled studies involving adult patients; the frequent lack of age-specific dose, long-term efficacy and tolerability/safety data; the lack of effective medications for many paediatric psychiatric disorders, most critically autism spectrum disorder; the scarcity and limitations of randomized placebo-controlled trials in paediatric psychopharmacology; the unexplored potential for the prevention of psychiatric disorders with adolescent- and adult-onset; the current lack of biomarkers to predict treatment response and severe adverse effects; the need for better preclinical data to foster the successful development of novel drug therapies; and the effective dissemination of evidence-based treatments to the general public, to better inform patients and families of the benefits and risks of pharmacological interventions during development.

Ther Adv Psychopharmacol 2011;1:25-29). It interferes with dopamine binding to D1, D2, D3, and D5 receptors but has high affinity to D4. It also has an anticholinergic effect and antagonizes \u03b1-adrenergic, histaminergic, and serotoninergic receptors (Oerther and Ahlenius. J Pharmacol Exp Ther 2000;292:731-736). Clozapine has proved effective in treating positive and negative symptoms in patients with refractory schizophrenia, thus accounting for its frequent use. Despite its effectiveness, this drug is not without its adverse effects. The most well known is agranulocytosis. There are, however, many others, such as myocarditis, aspiration pneumonia, ileus, fever, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglycemia, tachycardia, and weight gain, among others (Bruijnzeel et al. Asian J Psychiatr 2014;11:3-7). Fever induced by clozapine is a common phenomenon (Lowe et al. Ann Pharmacother 2007;41:1700-1704), which usually occurs in the first 4 weeks of treatment, and its prevalence oscillates from 0.5% and 55%, depending on the study (Jeong et al. Schizophr Res 2002;56:191-193; Young et al. Schizophr Bull 1998;24:381-390). The fever lasts for 2.5 days on average, and unless the treatment is discontinued, it generally abates between day 8 and 16 of treatment (Kohen et al. Ann Pharmacother 2009;43:143-146). There are several different theories about the physiopathological mechanism; it could be a variation of malignant neuroleptic syndrome, an infection secondary to neutropenia, and allergic reaction or the emergence of the immunomodulating effect of clozapine. Some case reports in the bibliography have shown that patients in treatment with clozapine can develop a mild leukocytosis, but the presence of other concurrent symptoms, which indicate infection, is not common (Tham and Dickson. J Clin Psychiatry 2002;63:880-884). The theory of an allergic reaction is unsupported because of the fact that the fever does not recur after reintroducing clozapine. So we question, \"What would be the attitudes to follow when we find clozapine-induced fever (Nielsen et al. J Clin Psychiatry 2013;74:603-613)?\" The management of patients with clozapine-induced fever should include a complete blood picture, liver and renal function tests, a creatine kinase test urine culture, and a chest x-ray. A nasopharyngeal aspirate can also be useful to exclude infection (Pui-yin Chung et al. Can J Psychiatry 2008;53:857-862). On the other hand, some drugs have been suggested for treatment of fever induced by clozapine. The use of acetaminophen, in the treatment of the fever induced by clozapine, is supported by many studies (Jeong et al. Schizophr Res 2002;56:191-193). In one of these, clozapine was suspended and restarted successfully after 1 week. However, in some studies, such as the case report of Tremeau et al (Clin Neuropharmacol 1997;20:168-170), clozapine was reduced instead of discontinued. In other studies, the recommendation is continuating clozapine treatment (Martin and Williams. J Psychiatry Neurosci 2013;38:E9-E10)."}, {"Title": "Reducing conflict and containment rates on acute psychiatric wards: The Safewards cluster randomised controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Acute psychiatric wards manage patients whose actions may threaten safety (conflict).

First, there are limited evidence-based practices for stigma reduction, and interventions to deal with stigma against mental health care providers are especially lacking. Second, there is a scarcity of training models for mental health professionals on how to reduce stigma in clinical services. Third, there is a lack of conceptual models for neuroscience approaches to stigma reduction, which are a requirement for high-tier competency in the ACGME Milestones for Psychiatry. The George Washington University (GWU) psychiatry residency program has developed an eight-week course on managing stigma that is based on social psychology and social neuroscience research. The course draws upon social neuroscience research demonstrating that stigma is a normal function of normal brains resulting from evolutionary processes in human group behavior. Based on these processes, stigma can be categorized according to different threats that include peril stigma, disruption stigma, empathy fatigue, moral stigma, and courtesy stigma. Grounded in social neuroscience mechanisms, residents are taught to develop interventions to manage stigma. Case examples illustrate application to common clinical challenges: (1) helping patients anticipate and manage stigma encountered in the family, community, or workplace; (2) ameliorating internalized stigma among patients; (3) conducting effective treatment from a stigmatized position due to prejudice from medical colleagues or patients' family members; and (4) facilitating patient treatment plans when stigma precludes engagement with mental health professionals.

Despite its importance, few formal, quantitative theories have described the mechanisms supporting this phenomenon. We propose that affective cognition involves applying domain-general reasoning processes to domain-specific content knowledge. Observers' knowledge about emotions is represented in rich and coherent lay theories, which comprise consistent relationships between situations, emotions, and behaviors. Observers utilize this knowledge in deciphering social agents' behavior and signals (e.g., facial expressions), in a manner similar to rational inference in other domains. We construct a computational model of a lay theory of emotion, drawing on tools from Bayesian statistics, and test this model across four experiments in which observers drew inferences about others' emotions in a simple gambling paradigm. This work makes two main contributions. First, the model accurately captures observers' flexible but consistent reasoning about the ways that events and others' emotional responses to those events relate to each other. Second, our work models the problem of emotional cue integration-reasoning about others' emotion from multiple emotional cues-as rational inference via Bayes' rule, and we show that this model tightly tracks human observers' empirical judgments. Our results reveal a deep structural relationship between affective cognition and other forms of inference, and suggest wide-ranging applications to basic psychological theory and psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Has evidence-based psychosocial treatment for anxiety disorders permeated usual care in community mental health settings?", "Abstract": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly when it includes an exposure component, is an empirically supported psychosocial treatment for anxiety disorders that has been shown to be highly efficacious, desirable to patients, and cost-effective. However, access to and receipt of exposure-based treatment CBT anxiety remains lacking despite these benefits. The current study reviewed electronic medical records at a large public outpatient psychiatry clinic in order to clarify what usual care for anxiety disorders entails, and to determine the extent to which effective psychosocial treatment is accessible to, and implemented with anxiety disorder patients. Database queries generated from the billing and medical record system at the Los Angeles County Adult Outpatient Psychiatry Clinic identified 582 patients presenting with an anxiety disorder diagnosis in a 6-month time frame. These patients' electronic medical records were reviewed using a standardized data collection form. Findings indicated that the majority of patients received pharmacological treatment for their anxiety. The majority of the psychosocial treatment delivered was supportive therapy. Among the minority of patients who did initiate CBT, an even smaller minority received treatment that included an exposure component, and those who did receive exposure likely received a sub-optimal dose. Understanding usual care delivery patterns is an important preliminary step to identifying and addressing barriers to optimal anxiety disorder treatment in adult community mental health settings."}, {"Title": "Replication and contradiction of highly cited research papers in psychiatry: 10-year follow-up.", "Abstract": "Contradictions and initial overestimates are not unusual among highly cited studies.

Study participants came from a psychiatry department's residency programs (N = 36) during academic year 2011-2012 with senior residents having the option to attend journal club. Using a multifaceted approach, measures included attendance, presession quizzes, postsession evaluations, and a final postcourse evaluation of 11 dimensions (e.g., goals, objectives).\nThirty-one (86%) trainees attended journal club-a substantial increase from previous years. The presession-quiz median was 4.4 total correct out of 6 questions (range = 3.3-5.3), indicating that the articles were generally read before the session.

In a preliminary investigation of self injuring college students who completed the OSI, exploratory analysis revealed four function factors (Internal Emotion Regulation, Social Influence, External Emotion Regulation and Sensation Seeking) and a single Addictive Features factor. Rates of NSSI are particularly high in inpatient psychiatry youth. The OSI can assistin both standardizing assessment regarding functions and potential addictive features and aid case formulation leading to informed treatment planning.

In so doing, it may improve psychiatric classification and the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. It can unite many levels of description in a mechanistic and rigorous fashion, while avoiding biological reductionism and artificial categorisation. We describe how computational models of cognition can infer the current state of the environment and weigh up future actions, and how these models provide new perspectives on two example disorders, depression and schizophrenia. Reinforcement learning describes how the brain can choose and value courses of actions according to their long-term future value. Some depressive symptoms may result from aberrant valuations, which could arise from prior beliefs about the loss of agency ('helplessness'), or from an inability to inhibit the mental exploration of aversive events. Predictive coding explains how the brain might perform Bayesian inference about the state of its environment by combining sensory data with prior beliefs, each weighted according to their certainty (or precision). Several cortical abnormalities in schizophrenia might reduce precision at higher levels of the inferential hierarchy, biasing inference towards sensory data and away from prior beliefs. We discuss whether striatal hyperdopaminergia might have an adaptive function in this context, and also how reinforcement learning and incentive salience models may shed light on the disorder. Finally, we review some of Computational Psychiatry's applications to neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, and some pitfalls to avoid when applying its methods."}, {"Title": "Agreement between physicians and liaison psychiatrists on depression in old age patients of a general hospital: influence of symptom severity, age and personality.", "Abstract": "Comorbid depressive episodes are common among general hospital inpatients.

The aim of the study was first to determine the degree of agreement between primary care physicians' and liaison psychiatrists' evaluation of depression, and second, to analyze how patients' clinical presentation and personality traits influence this degree of agreement.\nAgreement was defined as the matching of the physicians' initial referral for depressive mood and the actual diagnosis of a major depressive disorder evaluated by the consultation-liaison service in 148 inpatients aged 60+ years. Nature and severity of psychiatric symptoms were rated on the HoNOS65+ scale and patients' personality traits were assessed with the Big Five Inventory.\nForty percent of the patients referred for depressive mood were indeed diagnosed with major depression. Agreement between physicians and psychiatrists was most likely in patients with more severe depressive symptoms and younger age. In contrast, risk for non-agreement was increased for patients with more open personalities, yet lower levels of neuroticism, who were referred for depressive mood even though they presented another or even no psychiatric disorder.\nThese data reveal that the detection of late-life depression in general hospitals may be critically influenced by age, symptoms severity and personality traits."}, {"Title": "Duration of unspecific prodromal and clinical high risk states, and early help-seeking in first-admission psychosis patients.", "Abstract": "Prevention of psychosis requires both presence of clinical high risk (CHR) criteria and early help-seeking. Previous retrospective studies of the duration of untreated illness (i.e. prodrome plus psychosis) did not distinguish between prodromal states with and without CHR symptoms. Therefore, we examined the occurrence of CHR symptoms and first help-seeking, thereby considering effects of age at illness-onset.\nAdult patients first admitted for psychosis (n\u00a0=\u00a0126) were retrospectively assessed for early course of illness and characteristics of first help-seeking.\nOne-hundred and nine patients reported a prodrome, 58 with CHR symptoms. In patients with an early illness-onset before age 18 (n\u00a0=\u00a045), duration of both illness and psychosis were elongated, and CHR symptoms more frequent (68.9 vs. 33.3\u00a0%)\u00a0compared to those with adult illness-onset.

According to current psychosis-risk criteria, these CHR symptoms, in principle, would have allowed the early detection of psychosis. Furthermore, compared to patients with an adult illness-onset, patients with an early illness-onset were also more likely to seek help on their own account. Thus, future awareness strategies to improve CHR detection might be primarily related to young persons and self-perceived subtle symptoms."}, {"Title": "Towards Resilient Telehealth Support for Clinical Psychiatry and Psychology: A Strategic Review.", "Abstract": "Human beings have increasingly shown a willingness to adopt Internet, mHealth and telehealth applications as a part of managing their health.

They have been increasingly involved in dangerous areas with ill-defined boundaries, simmering internecine armed conflict, and disregard on the part of some local parties for peacekeepers' security and role. Yet progressively there have been expectations of financial restraint and austerity. Additionally, UN PKOs have become more \"robust,\" that is, engaged in preemptive, assertive operations. A statistically positive and significant relationship exists between missions' size, complexity, remoteness, and aggressive tenor and a higher probability of trauma or death, especially as a result of hostile actions or disease. Therefore, in the interest of \"force protection\" and optimizing operations, a key component of UN PKOs is health care and medical treatment. The expectation is that UN PKO medical support must conform to the general intent and structure of current UN PKOs to become more streamlined, portable, mobile, compartmentalized, and specialized, but also more varied and complex to address the medical aspects of these missions cost-efficiently. This article contends that establishing a hybrid level 2-a level 2 with level 3 modules and components (i.e., level 2+)-is a viable course of action when considering trends in the medical aspects of Post-Cold War UN PKOs. A level 2 medical treatment facility has the potential to provide needed forward mobile medical treatment, especially trauma care, for extended, complex, large-scale, and comprehensive UN PKOs. This is particularly the case for missions that include humanitarian outreach, preventive medicine, and psychiatry. The level 2 treatment facility is flexible enough to expand into a hybrid level 2+ with augmentation of modules based on changes in mission requirements and variation in medical aspects."}, {"Title": "Psychosurgery (1974-2014).

Previous reviews on recovery in mental health have presented definitions or a conceptual framework; however, over time it has been open to disparate interpretations. The aim of this paper was to conduct the first concept analysis of mental health recovery in young adulthood within various multidisciplinary contexts. Rodgers's (2000) six-stepped evolutionary method enabled the analysis of recovery's conceptual characteristics, the identification of an exemplar and the proposition of a hypothesis with implications for practice. This analysis has revealed the derivation of the term recovery does not convey its identified conceptual characteristics. Identified attributes include the reawakening of hope, reclaiming a positive self and meaning through personal growth. Antecedents include the disruption of illness, stigmatization, internal inventory and contemplative recovery. Identified consequences include the return to normality, reconstruction of self and active social connection. The new conceptual definition is the reawakening of hope and rediscovery of a positive sense of self through finding meaning and purpose within personal growth and connection using creative self-care coping strategies. This paper reveals an apparent disparity between professional and personal interpretations of recovery. Therefore, the implication for mental health nursing is the congruence of recovery-orientated practice with the process of recovery experienced by young adult service users."}, {"Title": "'Teaching' the therapeutic alliance Part 2.

Here we focus on one cultural issue that arose from research exploring how MH student nurses approach and interpret religion and culture in their practice - that is, the difficulties in determining the clinical significance of the religious beliefs and experiences expressed by the people they care for. While problems with establishing the cultural boundaries of normality in clinical assessments are an important area of debate in cultural psychiatry, it remains a peripheral issue in MH nurse education. An anthropologically informed qualitative research design underpinned 'critical incident' (CI)-focused ethnographic interviews with 36\u2009second and third-year MH nursing field students and seven undergraduate MH branch lecturers. Follow up focus groups were also carried out. Interview transcripts were subject to thematic analysis. Four subthemes were identified under the broad theme of the clinical significance of religious-type expression and experience: (1) identifying the difference between delusions and religious belief; (2) identifying whether an experience was hallucination or religious experience; (3) the clinical implications of such challenges; and (4) applying religion-specific knowledge. There are clinical implications that may result from the difficulties with assessing the clinical significance of religious beliefs and experiences, identified in both our research and within international cultural psychiatry literature and research. Misinterpretation and therefore wrongly assessing someone's experience as pathological is a significant concern. It is suggested that CI analysis could be adapted to help nurses, nursing students and nurse educators recognize the religious dimensions of mental distress, particularly those that then potentially impact upon the accuracy and person centeredness of clinical assessment. Further research is proposed to investigate the clinical assessment and training needs of nurses in the area of religion and mental distress."}, {"Title": "Improving Psychiatry Residents' Attitudes Toward Individuals Diagnosed with Substance Use Disorders.", "Abstract": "Special attention needs to be paid to the attitudes of psychiatry residents toward individuals diagnosed with substance use disorders.

To develop a benchmark we reviewed different approaches for defining \"clinical significance\" applied in schizophrenia research and identified that an improvement of 15 points on the PANSS Total is considered meaningful in clinical settings. Using this benchmark and we simulated thousands of schizophrenia trials, using characteristics derived from the NEWMEDS database with over 8000 patients with schizophrenia, to the kind of imaging, genetic, and other biomarkers that could attain clinical significance. We plotted the interaction between frequency-of-occurrence, the effect size of biomarkers and their relationship to the clinical significance threshold. Results show that categorical biomarkers are likely to attain clinical significance when they occur in 20-50% of the clinical population, and can predict at least a 8-10 point PANSS scale difference. Genetic markers are likely to have clinical significance when they occur in 20-50% of the population and can predict 7-9 points on the PANSS scale. A marker with a lower frequency or lesser effect size would find it hard to meet clinical significance thresholds for schizophrenia. The assumptions and limitations of this approach are discussed.

A sensitivity analysis was also performed.\nThe hospital production cost of a cure for treating depression was estimated at \u20ac\u00a01932.94 (\u20ac\u00a0503.55 for equipment, \u20ac\u00a01082.75 for the staff, and \u20ac\u00a0346.65 for structural expenses).\nThis cost-estimate has resulted from an innovative, pragmatic, and cooperative approach. It is slightly higher but more comprehensive than the costs estimated by the few international studies. However, it is limited due to structure-specific problems and activity. This work could be repeated in other circumstances in order to obtain a more general estimate, potentially helpful for determining an official price for the French health care system.

Odor-evoked memories are experienced as more emotional compared with verbal, visual, and tactile stimuli. Moreover, the emotional quality of odor cues increases memory performance, but contrary to this, odors are poor retrieval cues for verbal labels. To examine the relation between the emotional quality of an odor and its likelihood of identification, this study evaluates how normative emotion ratings based on the 3-dimensional affective space model (that includes valence, arousal, and dominance), using the Self-Assessment Manikin by Bradley and Lang (Bradley MM, Lang PJ. 1994. Measuring emotion: the Self-Assessment Manikin and the Semantic Differential.

The demographic and diagnostic information, evidence of metabolic screening, blood test results, and medications of patients with a recorded general practitioner were compared with those of patients with no recorded general practitioner.\nNinety-eight of 191 (51%) of patients had details of a general practitioner documented in their medical records. There were no significant differences in rates of metabolic screening between the two groups. Those with a general practitioner had more medical diagnoses and were taking a greater number of psychiatric medications.\nAlthough the medical comorbidities of serious mental illness are becoming increasingly recognised, our findings suggest the need for ongoing and coordinated efforts by policymakers, general practitioners, mental health services and patients to ensure the health and longevity of people with serious mental illness."}, {"Title": "The relationship between manual coordination and mental health.", "Abstract": "Motor coordination impairments frequently co-occur with other developmental disorders and mental health problems in clinically referred populations. But does this reflect a broader dimensional relationship within the general population? A clearer understanding of this relationship might inform improvements in mental health service provision. However, ascertainment and referral bias means that there is limited value in conducting further research with clinically referred samples. We, therefore, conducted a cross-sectional population-based study investigating children's manual coordination using an objective computerised test. These measures were related to teacher-completed responses on a behavioural screening questionnaire [the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)]. We sampled 298 children (4-11 years old; 136 males) recruited from the general population. Hierarchical (logistic and linear) regression modelling indicated significant categorical and continuous relationships between manual coordination and overall SDQ score (a dimensional measure of psychopathology). Even after controlling for gender and age, manual coordination explained 15 % of the variance in total SDQ score. This dropped to 9 % after exclusion of participants whose SDQ responses indicated potential mental health problems. These results: (1) indicate that there is a clear relationship between children's motor and mental health development in community-based samples; (2) demonstrate the relationship's dimensional nature; and (3) have implications for service provision."}, {"Title": "Does \"Individual Placement and Support\" Satisfy the Users' Needs?", "Abstract": "This study aims to investigate clients' satisfaction with individual placement and support (IPS) at the University Hospital for Psychiatry Zurich (PUK).

The following IPS services were available: (i) randomized controlled trial (RCT) ZHEPP (www.zhepp.ch), (ii) RCT ZInEP (www.zinep.ch), and (iii) us clinical supported employment service of PUK (IPS-PUK). The clients mostly indicated that IPS was generally useful and fitted their needs. Overall satisfaction of the participants with the IPS services of the PUK was very high. Furthermore, client satisfaction and symptom severity are inversely associated. In conclusion, participants of the IPS services received the support they were looking for. This means that the approach of IPS fits the needs of different patient groups and can be used without any modifications. The most important limitation is the unequal group sizes.

Much of this realignment has been made possible by accessing and integrating new pharmaceuticals into psychiatric hospital settings. Less straightforward have been the painful attempts to create a system modeled on international standards for training and certifying psychotherapists. Unfortunately, the political, economic, infrastructural, and epistemological environment of the Romanian mental health care system has prevented many other reforms. This paper examines the ironic trajectory that Romanian psychiatry has taken since the end of state socialism. Specifically, this paper shows how psychiatric practice in most places (outside of university-training hospitals) is increasingly disconnected from a concern with the social conditions that surround mental illness during a period when social upheaval is profoundly impacting the lives of many people who receive mental health care. Thus, as the contribution of social problems to the suffering of those with mental illnesses has increased, some Romanian mental health practitioners have moved away from a concern with these social problems under the guise of aligning their psychiatric practices with (imagined) Western standards of biomedical care. The paper provides a brief history of Romanian psychiatry and explores contemporary challenges and contradictions in many Romanian psychiatric treatment settings through the case study of a 31-year-old Romanian female diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Gut feelings 2.

Based on growing empirical evidence, we believe that this definition warrants expansion to include the concept of positive psychiatry. In the present article, we provide a critical overview of this emerging field and a select review of relevant scientific literature. Positive psychiatry may be defined as the science and practice of psychiatry that seeks to understand and promote well-being through assessment and interventions involving positive psychosocial characteristics (PPCs) in people who suffer from or are at high risk of developing mental or physical illnesses. It can also benefit nonclinical populations. Positive psychiatry has 4 main components: (1) positive mental health outcomes (eg, well-being), (2) PPCs that comprise psychological traits (resilience, optimism, personal mastery and coping self-efficacy, social engagement, spirituality and religiosity, and wisdom-including compassion) and environmental factors (family dynamics, social support, and other environmental determinants of overall health), (3) biology of positive psychiatry constructs, and (4) positive psychiatry interventions including preventive ones. There are promising empirical data to suggest that positive traits may be improved through psychosocial and biological interventions. As a branch of medicine rooted in biology, psychiatry, especially with the proposed conceptualization of positive psychiatry, is well poised to provide major contributions to the positive mental health movement, thereby impacting the overall health care of the population."}, {"Title": "The virtual institution: cross-sectional length of stay in general adult and forensic psychiatry beds.", "Abstract": "Length of stay in psychiatric hospitals interests health service planners, economists and clinicians. At a systems level it is preferable to study general adult and forensic psychiatric beds together since these are likely to be inter-dependent. We examined whether patients were placed according to specialist need or according to their cross-sectional length of stay.\nA one night census of all registered mental nursing home (RMNH) beds was carried out for a defined catchment area of 1.2\u00a0m population in north London in November 1999. This included all public sector psychiatric hospital beds, independent sector and forensic beds in and outside the catchment area. Cross-sectional length of stay was defined as time since the date of admission from the community. Log rank (Mantel-Cox) Chi squared was used to test for differences between groups and hierarchical logistic regression for statistical modelling.\nThere were 1,085 occupied psychiatric beds. Cross-sectional LOS was greater than 365\u00a0days in 43.5%. Forensic beds had longer cross-sectional LOS than general beds. LOS increased with the level of therapeutic security from open through low, medium and high secure. Cross-sectional LOS was shorter for open hospital beds than community RMNH beds, shorter for informal patients than those detained under civil mental health law, and longest for forensic detentions. Longest cross-sectional LOS were for patients placed in RMNHs in the community, 10.7% of whom were 'forensic' as were 25.4% of low secure patients. Designated length of stay (acute, rehab/medium term and long term) was also associated with increasing cross-sectional LOS. In regression analysis only three variables contributed to a model of cross-sectional LOS, commissioning status (general or forensic), designated length of stay and designated level of therapeutic security.\nStudying cross-sectional LOS for whole systems (all psychiatric beds) is essential for operational health service management. At the time of this survey 'forensic' status was the main way of accessing long term high dependency places. This has been an organic development over time, a response to patient needs rather than the outcome of any specific policy or plan."}, {"Title": "Homicide committed by psychiatric patients: Psychiatrists' liability in Italian law cases.", "Abstract": "Interest in psychiatrists' professional liability in Italy has increased in recent years because of the number of medical malpractice claims. Professional liability for failure to prevent violent behaviour by psychiatric patients is particularly debated.

Examination of the cases focuses on claims of malpractice, patients' characteristics, the circumstances of the homicide and the reasons for the court's judgment. In particular, the predictability of violent behaviour and the concept of causal links are examined in detail. The cases provide an opportunity for a study of comparative jurisprudence.

Inadequate language skills and cultural differences may give rise to challenges. The objective of this study was to investigate the views of Norwegian specialty registrars in psychiatry with regard to a mentoring scheme for foreign doctors and how such a support scheme ought to be designed.\nData were collected in focus-group interviews with specialty registrars in psychiatry. Altogether 24 Norwegian and 16 foreign doctors participated in a total of five focus groups. Thematic analysis was used as methodology.\nOne consistent finding pertained to the differing views on the need for a mentoring scheme among the Norwegian and foreign doctors respectively. The foreign doctors perceived few problems in terms of language and culture, while their Norwegian colleagues had occasionally experienced considerable problems in this respect. Moreover, obstacles in terms of attitude to a mentoring scheme were revealed among the foreign doctors, as well as differing opinions regarding the organisation of such a scheme, especially in terms of its voluntariness and having peers as mentors (horizontal organisation) versus having superiors as mentors (vertical organisation).\nThe differences in attitude to a mentoring scheme are partly caused by perception of the problem's extent and partly by varying norms and values among foreign and Norwegian doctors respectively. We propose that various forms of mentoring scheme be tested in a pilot project, in which the foreign doctors are actively involved."}, {"Title": "International medical graduates' perceptions of entering the profession in Norway.", "Abstract": "There is little knowledge available about how it feels for an international medical graduate arriving in Norway.

They had worked as doctors in Norway for less than two years. Transcriptions of the interviews were analysed using the Systematic Text Condensation method.\nTheir background for working in Norway varied. Some had an affiliation to the country and a social network, which appeared to be a support during the initial period. Many perceived the authorisation process as bureaucratic and as throwing suspicion on them. The doctors felt that they could cope with most of their work assignments, but reported having faced challenges in terms of language, a lack of insight into systems and uncertainty regarding what was expected of the doctor's role in a Norwegian context. There was also uncertainty associated with a perceived absence of collegial support. Because of the availability of jobs, some had adjusted their career plans towards psychiatry, geriatrics or general practice.\nIt appears that preparatory measures such as training courses, tests and the authorisation process fail to provide the practice-related experience and local knowledge that many doctors feel that they need in their new job situation.

He thus dedicated a period spent in the Dutch East Indies (Java) in 1904 to transcultural psychiatric research. This paper endeavours to compile Kraepelin's key findings, aiming to make readers aware of what kind of transcultural research Kraepelin did and what conclusions he came up with. At the same time it provides some background for the question of whether Kraepelin can really be referred to as the founder of transcultural psychiatry.\nKraepelin assumed that illnesses with exterior causes depended on the type of stimulants widely used in a given culture. Since he found little evidence for progressive paralysis, he concluded that European brains were particularly prone to sequelae of syphilis. For endogenous psychoses he postulated differences in both symptoms and courses, depressions being rarer and milder, and ceasing sooner. By contrast, he found dementia praecox (mainly covered by the concept of schizophrenias later) to be the most prevalent mental illness in Java, explicitly different in form from that in Europe."}, {"Title": "Are psychiatrists trained to be leaders in mental health?

Early in the disease course, patients often present with marked psychosis and mood disturbances (i.e. mania, depression), explaining why most of these patients are first seen by psychiatrists. Hence, autoimmune encephalitis is receiving growing attention from psychiatry, mainly owing to concerns over misdiagnosing immunomediated and potentially curable disorders as primary psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or major depressive disorder. Although anti-NMDAR encephalitis occurs in the context of new-onset psychiatric symptoms, there is a lack of information on differential diagnosis and treatment of this disorder after a long-term diagnostic history of functional psychiatric disorders.

This review aimed to identify the obstacles to, and opportunities for, providing CAMHS in LMICs. Articles from PsychInfo and PubMed, published up to November 2011, were retrieved using the search terms \"child and adolescent\", \"mental health services\", \"child psychiatry\", \"low- and middle-income countries\", \"low-income countries\" and \"developing countries\". Articles were then retrieved from PubMed alone, using these search terms plus the individual country names of 154 LMICs. Fifty-four articles were retrieved from PsychInfo and 632 from PubMed. Searching PubMed with 154 LMIC names retrieved seven related articles. Inclusion criteria were (i) articles relating to CAMHS or child psychiatric services; (ii) subjects included in the articles were inhabitants of LMICs or developing countries; (iii) articles reported in English. After removal of duplicates, 22 articles remained. The contents of these articles were categorized and analysed by use of the six domains of the World Health Organization assessment instrument for mental health systems (WHO-AIMS), a tool developed to collect information on available resources within mental health systems. The provision of CAMHS in LMICs clearly needs a specific strategy to maximize the potential of limited resources. Mental health-policy and awareness campaigns are powerful measures to drive CAMHS. Training in CAMH for primary health-care professionals, and integration of CAMHS into existing primary health-care services, is essential in resource-constrained settings.

An open label study.", "Abstract": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a chronic mental illness with a prevalence of 5-7% in the general population. t GAD is characterized by extreme persistent worry, mostly about minor problems, involving pathological fear with high occurrences of vegetative disturbance. GAD leads to functional impairment and a significantly reduced patient's quality of life. According to the guidelines of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP), the first-line treatments for GAD are Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), Selective serotonin- and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and pregabalin, an atypical anxiolytic. In this study, both efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin were evaluated and compared with efficacy and tolerability of sertraline, an SSRI antidepressant.\n107 patients both male and female, aged 20-60 were included in the study. All patients were hospitalized outward at the Psychiatric Clinic. Patients fulfilled criteria for GAD, according to ICD-X and DSM-IV. Each patient was randomly assigned to 4 weeks of treatment with pregabalin (n=47) or sertraline (n=60). Patients treated with sertraline were previously treated with SSRIs and SNRIs without remission, according to the latest National Clinical Guideline issued by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence for treating GAD (NICE). The primary analysis was the change in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA), a total score from baseline to endpoint. The second indicator of efficacy was the change in the HAMA psychic (emotional) and somatic (physical) scores, weekly, till endpoint. Global clinical assessment was conducted by using the Clinical Global Impression change rating (CGI).\nBoth pregabalin and sertraline showed good results in treating symptoms of Generalized Anxious Disorder. The onset of action was shorter in treatment with pregabalin compared to the treatment with sertraline. In the patients treated with sertraline, the anxiolytic effect was detectable after at least 14 days while pregabalin showed initial good results during the first week of treatment. Adverse effects were reported in 28% patients treated with pregabalin and 27% of patients treated with sertraline, without significant differences. There were no drop-out patients in neither group. Beside pharmacotherapy, each patient received 8 weeks of cognitive/behavior therapy. In concomitant therapy benzodiazepine was used (klonazepam, in low doses). In all patients adverse events were short-lasting withmild intensity and there were no withdrawal events during this study.\nEfficacy and tolerability of pregabalin were high. Compared to sertraline, pregabalin showed more rapid onset of action and equal efficacy. Adverse reactions are short-lasting and the dose depends. Our investigation showed that pregabalin, an atypic anxiolytic is efficient and well tolerable in treatment of GAD."}, {"Title": "Antipsychotic-Induced Movement Disorder: Screening via Telemental Health.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this brief report is to make clinical and research recommendations to advance current knowledge and practices related to the assessment of antipsychotic drug-induced movement disorders (DIMDs) via live interactive videoconferencing.\nThe authors provide an overview of the frequent neurological side effects of antipsychotic drugs and review relevant telemedicine research. DIMD prevention is critical, but these disorders remain underdetected and under-reported. Although there are not yet formal recommendations for specific screening tools or screening frequency, baseline and annual assessments are generally agreed-upon minimums. As DIMD awareness increases and more specific guidelines are developed to steer assessments, telemental health may aid practitioners in efficiently and regularly monitoring onset and severity. Research shows that videoconferencing can be used for effective psychiatric treatments and assessment, with at least one study validating the use of videoconference assessment for a subset of movement disorders.\nClinical recommendations include developing practice-level protocols and procedures that include regular DIMD assessment (either in-person or via telemedicine) for the full spectrum of possible movement disorders for all patients taking antipsychotic medications.

The drug represents the first of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to reach the market. Zelmid was synthesized in 1971 and launched by the Swedish firm Astra in 1982, but subsequently withdrawn the next year because of adverse neurological effects. This paper draws on in-depth interviews with scientists representing both industry and academia who had high-level involvement in various phases of the project (experimental, pre-clinical and clinical), as well as on textual sources such as scientific articles and memoirs. Zelmid was a product of mechanism-based or \"rational\" drug discovery from the early 1960s and the associated intermingling of science and commerce. It is argued that both scientists and the pharmaceutical company shared an interest in embracing mechanism-based drug discovery because it simultaneously promised medico-scientific advances and profits. However, the intermingling of science and commerce also strained the relationship between scientific and commercial priorities further along the trajectory of the drug; for example, concerning issues such as dosage strategy and drug use in primary care, where corporate management allegedly took decisions contrary to the recommendations of both academic and company scientists. On such occasions the asymmetry in power became apparent in scientists' narratives: commercial considerations trumped those of science since, ultimately, decisions rest with management, not with scientists. In addition, temporality appears to be associated with the divergence of commercial and scientific priorities. While rare during experimental and pre-clinical phases, divergence was concentrated downstream to the clinical testing and post-marketing phases. It is hypothesized that a similar pattern of convergence and divergence of commercial and scientific priorities may exist in the trajectory of other drugs."}, {"Title": "The New DSM-5 Impairment Criterion: A Challenge to Early Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis?", "Abstract": "The possible effect of the DSM-5 impairment criterion on diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in young children was examined in 127 children aged 20-47 months with a DSM-IV-TR clinical consensus diagnosis of ASD. The composite score of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) served as a proxy for the DSM-5 impairment criterion. When applying a mild level of impairment (cutoff: 1 SD below the mean on the VABS), 88 % of the cases fulfilled the impairment criterion. Sixty-nine percent fulfilled the impairment criterion at a moderate level (1.5 SDs) and 33 % at a severe level (2 SDs).

The aim of this multicenter feasibility test was an evaluation of the measurability of cross-sectoral quality indicators for depression and schizophrenia by means of routine data.\nThe feasibility of the quality indicators was assessed in ten specialist clinics for psychiatry and psychotherapy by means of retrospective analyses of anonymous routine data. The data were extracted from the routine clinical documentation of the hospital information systems and the data from the admission and discharge sheets of the basic documentation in psychiatry (BADO) were additionally used for some clinics. Analyses were conducted for all cases of adults diagnosed with depression or schizophrenia within predefined assessment periods.\nIn total five indicators for depression and nine indicators for schizophrenia were assessed and evaluated as measurable or measurable to a limited extent, sometimes with slight adaptations in the operationalization of the indicator. Due to variations in documentation, some indicators could not be calculated for all clinics. Most indicators could be collated with the data from the BADO.\nAn assessment of indicators that measure quality-relevant aspects of care in depression and schizophrenia, is partially feasible by means of current routine data documentation analysis from the participating clinics. However, differing documentation methodologies in the participating clinics impeded a uniform assessment; therefore, for the implementation of nationwide minimum standards for the quality assurance of mental healthcare, a uniform cross-sectoral documentation methodology should be adapted to consensus and relevant quality indicators.

If the assumptions used to derive the prevalence estimate are invalid or if the uncertainty surrounding these assumptions is not properly accounted for in the statistical inference procedure, then the point estimate may be inaccurate and the confidence interval may not be a true reflection of the precision of the estimate. We examine these potential pitfalls in the context of a recent high-profile finding by Kim et al. (2011, Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders in a total population sample. American Journal of Psychiatry 168: 904-912), who estimated that autism spectrum disorder affects 2.64% of children in a South Korean community. We reconstructed the study's methodology and used Monte Carlo simulations to analyze whether their point estimate and 95% confidence interval (1.91%, 3.37%) were reasonable, given what was known about their screening instrument and sample. We find the original point estimate to be highly assumption-dependent, and after accounting for sources of uncertainty unaccounted for in the original article, we demonstrate that a more reasonable confidence interval would be approximately twice as large as originally reported. We argue that future studies should give serious consideration to the additional sources of uncertainty introduced by a two-phase design, which may easily outstrip any expected gains in efficiency."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry Resident Quality of Life.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate psychiatry resident physician quality of life.\nA voluntary, anonymous, 10-min survey was e-mailed to residents from all 14 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited programs in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.

Using a five-point Likert-type scale (1\u2009=\u2009strongly disagree and 5\u2009=\u2009strongly agree), residents ranked the session based on the following characteristics: the overall experience, interest in participating in telepsychiatry in the future, understanding service provision to underserved areas, telepsychiatry as mode of service delivery, and the unique aspects of telepsychiatry work. The authors also conducted a content analysis of narrative comments in response to open-ended questions about the positive and negative aspects of the training experience.\nIn all, 88% of residents completed (n\u2009=\u2009335) an anonymous evaluation following their participation in telepsychiatry consultation sessions. Numeric results were mostly positive and indicated that the experience was interesting and enjoyable, enhanced interest in participating in telepsychiatry in the future, and increased understanding of providing psychiatric services to underserved communities. Narrative data demonstrated that the most valuable aspects of training included the knowledge acquired in terms of establishing rapport and engaging with patients, using the technology, working collaboratively, identifying different approaches used, and awareness of the complexity of cases. Resident desire for more training of this nature was prevalent, specifically a wish for more detail, additional time for discussion and debriefing, and further explanation of the unique aspects of telepsychiatry as mode of delivery.\nMore evaluation of telepsychiatry training, elective or required, is needed.

However, little is known about the educational needs of psychiatrists in practice delivering integrated care to inform the development of integrated care training experiences.\nThe educational needs of the integrated care team were assessed by surveying psychiatric consultants who work in integrated care.\nA convenience sample of 52 psychiatrists working in integrated care responded to the survey. The majority of the topics included in the survey were considered educational priorities (>50% of the psychiatrists rated them as essential) for the psychiatric consultant role. Psychiatrists' perspectives on educational priorities for behavioral health providers (BHPs) and primary care providers (PCPs) were also identified. Almost all psychiatrists reported that they provide educational support for PCPs and BHPs (for PCP 92%; for BHP 96%).\nThe information provided in this report suggests likely educational needs of the integrated care psychiatric consultant and provides insight into the learning needs of other integrated care team members.

Participants' engagement in Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) has, however, been difficult and may particularly be so in specialized settings, such as semi-residential psychiatry. In this paper, the use of a web-based ROM system implemented in a child semi-residential psychiatric setting is described and predictors associated with low completion rates of questionnaires by parents are identified.\nParents and the multidisciplinary team of 46 children admitted to semi-residential psychiatric treatment participated in this study and completed a battery of questionnaires in three month intervals.\nThe overall completion rate of both parents during ROM assessment was 77\u00a0% compared to 83\u00a0% of all clinicians involved. Completion of questionnaires by parents was higher around first assessments and declined after a year treatment. For eight clients at least one of the parents stopped filling out questionnaires during ROM measuring. Logistic multilevel analyses revealed initial treatment factors associated with a low completion of questionnaires by parents during ROM: high comorbidity of the child on DSM Axis I, single parenthood, a higher parental educational level and having a weaker therapeutic alliance regarding goal setting.\nThe findings in this paper demonstrate relatively high completion of questionnaires by clinicians and parents when using ROM in child semi-residential psychiatry. Strong administrative and electronic support undoubtedly contributed to this result. Clinicians are encouraged to motivate parents to mutually invest in ROM, and to take into account factors indicating a possible lower completion of questionnaires by parents."}, {"Title": "The transdiagnostic dimension of psychosis: implications for psychiatric nosology and research.", "Abstract": "If psychosis is a transdiagnostic dimension, the expression of which is governed by a dynamic set of contextual and emotional factors that are amenable to treatment, current approaches in psychiatric nosology and therapeutic research may need to be revised. The dominant approach to date is to clinically and conceptually situate psychotic symptoms in the construct of schizophrenia. However, schizophrenia, which has a lifetime prevalence of 1%, only represents the poor outcome fraction of a much broader spectrum of psychotic disorders which have a lifetime prevalence of 3.5%. Therefore, research findings in schizophrenia may reflect mechanisms of prognosis rather than fundamental associations with psychosis and other symptom domains per se. Similarly, the discovery that up to 30% of individuals with non-psychotic common mental disorders have subthreshold psychotic symptoms that situate them on the transdiagnostic dimension of psychosis - and which impact clinical severity and treatment response - indicates that the rigid separation between 'psychotic' and 'non-psychotic' hampers both clinical practice and research. Diagnostic manuals in psychiatry would benefit from a system of transdiagnostic dimensions, including a transdiagnostic dimension of psychosis. Introduction of transdiagnostic dimensions allows for a system combining a nomothetic (i.e., group-specific) categorical diagnosis with an idiographic (i.e., person-specific) combination of dimensional scores. The advantage of such a system is that it encourages consideration of how symptoms dynamically interact with each other in a network of psychopathology, and of how this network is impacted by the social world."}, {"Title": "[An inclusive misunderstanding--why noncategorization in special education for people with emotional and social behavior disorders complicates the cooperation with child and adolescent psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The welcomed coeducation of children and adolescents with and without disabilities is going into dangerous territory since it has become burdened with a number of illusionary expectations.

From our systematic literature review, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) results effective in all forms of catatonia, even after pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines has failed. Response rate ranges from 80% to 100% and results superior to those of any other therapy in psychiatry. ECT should be considered first-line treatment in patients with malignant catatonia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, delirious mania or severe catatonic excitement, and in general in all catatonic patients that are refractory or partially responsive to benzodiazepines. Early intervention with ECT is encouraged to avoid undue deterioration of the patient's medical condition. Little is known about the long-term treatment outcomes following administration of ECT for catatonia. The presence of a concomitant chronic neurologic disease or extrapyramidal deficit seems to be related to ECT non-response. On the contrary, the presence of acute, severe and psychotic mood disorder is associated with good response. Severe psychotic features in responders may be related with a prominent GABAergic mediated deficit in orbitofrontal cortex, whereas non-responders may be characterized by a prevalent dopaminergic mediated extrapyramidal deficit. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that ECT is more effective in \"top-down\" variant of catatonia, in which the psychomotor syndrome may be sustained by a dysregulation of the orbitofrontal cortex, than in \"bottom-up\" variant, in which an extrapyramidal dysregulation may be prevalent. Future research should focus on ECT response in different subtype of catatonia and on efficacy of maintenance ECT in long-term prevention of recurrent catatonia. Further research on mechanism of action of ECT in catatonia may also contribute to the development of other brain stimulation techniques."}, {"Title": "Traumatic episodes and mental health effects in young men and women in Rwanda, 17 years after the genocide.", "Abstract": "To investigate mental health effects associated with exposure to trauma in Rwanda during the 1994 genocide period, and over the lifetime, in Rwandan men and women aged 20-35 years.\nThis was a cross-sectional population-based study conducted in the southern province of Rwanda.

The goals of this paper are to show the potential benefits for the development of a media literacy curriculum for psychiatry residents, including critical media literacy skills, media history taking, and counseling concepts. Our hopes are that trained residents may learn to effectively teach these literacy skills to their patients, patients' families, educators, and other health professionals as a preventive measure against potential negative mental health effects of reality television."}, {"Title": "A Qualitative Analysis of Medical Students' Reflection on Attending an Alcoholics Anonymous Meeting: Insights for Future Addiction Curricula.", "Abstract": "This paper describes medical students' views of alcoholism and their response to attending an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting during their psychiatry clerkship. This may assist other educators in planning their addiction curricula.\nMedical students were required to attend an AA meeting during their psychiatry clerkship and then to write a reflection piece on this experience. We selected a random sample of 40 pieces and performed a qualitative analysis to identify the prominent ideas and themes in this sample.\nMedical students found their experience attending an AA meeting to be educationally valuable. They reported their familiarity with AA prior to this experience was largely limited to popular media depictions. Students reported understanding alcoholism as a disease with both biological and psychosocial components. They were often concerned with the presence of religiosity and spirituality at the meetings. Following the experience, students felt more comfortable referring patients to AA and identified empathy, honesty, and openness as crucial contributors to the efficacy of AA.\nStudents felt that attending an AA meeting during their psychiatry clerkship was an educationally valuable experience. Medical students' familiarity with addiction treatment is limited, and attending an AA meeting may be helpful in increasing their comfort with treating addicted patients in the future. In addition, educators may want to explicitly address the spirituality issue related to some treatment programs to increase the likelihood that future physicians feel comfortable referring their patients to recovery programs."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of a National Online Educational Program in Geriatric Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This study provides evaluation results of an online study group (OSG) for geriatric psychiatry continuing professional development.\nThe OSG is an interactive, expert-facilitated, asynchronous educational experience for psychiatrists and residents in Canada. A retrospective web survey assessed self-efficacy, knowledge in geriatric psychiatry, comfort with online learning, and perceived effectiveness of the instructional methods. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and descriptive statistics were calculated.\nTwenty-nine (of 50) participants (58\u00a0%) completed the questionnaire. Although only 48\u00a0% of respondents reported improved perceived knowledge, 79\u00a0% reported improved efficacy beliefs, and 76\u00a0% reported improved comfort with online learning. Most (79\u00a0%) would consider taking OSG again, and 93\u00a0% would recommend it to others.\nThe OSG was well-received, with greater benefits for self-efficacy with the material and comfort with online learning than for perceived knowledge itself.

We systematically examined how long an adolescent waits for a new patient appointment with a psychiatrist for routine medication management. From state directories, we identified 578 providers of adolescent psychiatric care in Ohio. Researchers posing as parents telephoned randomly selected offices, seeking care for a hypothetical 14-year-old patient under different scenarios. Overall, we measured 498 wait times at 140 unique offices. The median wait time was 50 days (interquartile range = 29-81 days). In adjusted models, adolescents with Medicaid waited longer than those with private insurance, especially during the spring (geometric mean = 50.9 vs. 41.9 days; p = 0.02). Wait times also varied markedly by region, with geometric means ranging from 22.4 to 75.1 days (p < 0.01). This study demonstrates that adolescents often experience lengthy wait times for routine care. This methodology represents a useful approach to real-time monitoring of psychiatric services."}, {"Title": "A Population-Based Care Improvement Initiative for Patients at Risk for Delirium, Alcohol Withdrawal, and Suicide Harm.", "Abstract": "In a population-based approach, a hospital-wide interprofessional care redesign at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH; Boston), was conducted to provide optimal evidence-informed care for patients at risk for delirium, alcohol abuse, and suicide harm (DASH). The initiative involved enhanced screening and the introduction of new care management guidelines and order sets pertaining to the DASH diagnoses.\nAn interprofessional group from medicine, nursing, and psychiatry jointly led a hospitalwide effort for the improvement of care and outcomes of patients presenting with a DASH diagnosis (delirium, alcohol withdrawal, and suicide harm). The care improvement process consisted of four phases: (1) development of guidelines, (2) imple mentation/rollout, (3) integration into practice, and (4) sustainability, including ongoing practice development and evaluation.\nImplementation outcomes were evaluated using eight parameters-acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, implementation cost, penetration, and sustainability. Internal billing data and ICD-9-CM [International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification] diagnostic codes were used to identify the DASH population. Patients were compared pre- and postprogram implementation for fiscal years 2010 through 2013. The average length of stay, reported as the number of midnights in the hospital, remained consistent for DASH patients-9.3-10.0 days (versus 5.3-6.0 days for BWH over all). The DASH readmission rate decreased by 9%-from 15.1% to 13.7%, approaching the overall BWH rate of 13.3%.\nClose nurse-physician collaboration, including joint leadership and simultaneous rollout for nurses and physicians, contributed to the initiative's effective implementation."}, {"Title": "Reward salience and risk aversion underlie differential ACC activity in substance dependence.", "Abstract": "The medial prefrontal cortex, especially the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), has long been implicated in cognitive control and error processing. Although the association between ACC and behavior has been established, it is less clear how ACC contributes to dysfunctional behavior such as substance dependence. Evidence from neuroimaging studies investigating ACC function in substance users is mixed, with some studies showing disengagement of ACC in substance dependent individuals (SDs), while others show increased ACC activity related to substance use. In this study, we investigate ACC function in SDs and healthy individuals performing a change signal task for monetary rewards. Using a priori predictions derived from a recent computational model of ACC, we find that ACC activity differs between SDs and controls in factors related to reward salience and risk aversion between SDs and healthy individuals. Quantitative fits of a computational model to fMRI data reveal significant differences in best fit parameters for reward salience and risk preferences. Specifically, the ACC in SDs shows greater risk aversion, defined as concavity in the utility function, and greater attention to rewards relative to reward omission. Furthermore, across participants risk aversion and reward salience are positively correlated. The results clarify the role that ACC plays in both the reduced sensitivity to omitted rewards and greater reward valuation in SDs. Clinical implications of applying computational modeling in psychiatry are also discussed."}, {"Title": "Disordered eating behavior among group fitness instructors: a health-threatening secret?", "Abstract": "The present study aimed to examine disordered eating behavior (DE) and self-reported eating disorders (ED) among Norwegian group fitness instructors.\nGroup fitness instructors from Norway (n\u2009=\u2009685 females and 152 males, response rate: 57\u00a0%) completed an online survey. The survey included the instruments Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI) and the Exercise Dependence Scale (EDS).\nA total of 22\u00a0% of the male and 59\u00a0% of the female respondents were classified with DE. The respondents classified with DE had higher BMI, more weight loss attempts, and higher total EDI score compared to the respondents with no DE.

The instructors with self-reported current ED had higher weekly volume of instructing classes compared to the other instructors. None of the respondents with self-reported ED had informed their center manager about it.\nThe high prevalence of DE behavior calls for concern. The reported secrecy regarding self-reported ED might decrease the possibility for early recognition and intervention. The findings reveal implications for the instructors' physical and mental health, for their reputation and impact as important healthy role models and health/fitness authorities, and for the importance of prevention, identification and management of such behavior in fitness center settings."}, {"Title": "The clinical profile of patients with anorexia nervosa in Singapore: a follow-up descriptive study.", "Abstract": "The prevalence rate of anorexia nervosa is lower in Asia than in the West, although studies have found that it is on the rise in Asia.

Stepwise logistic regression analyses were used to determine whether demographic characteristics or categories of psychotropic medications were able to independently predict patient refusals of off-label prescribing.\nThe final sample included 447 psychiatrists, and 93% of the respondents (416/447) had experiences with off-label prescribing to children. In addition, 39.7% of the respondents (165/416) experienced patient refusal of off-label prescribing when they informed the children and/or parents of the prescribing. The most commonly prescribed off-label psychotropic medications were antipsychotics (82.0%). Patient refusal was significantly more frequent when the respondents informed parents (p=0.02) and children (p<0.01) about off-label prescribing than when they did not. A stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that informing parents (odds ratio [OR], 2.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-6.82) or children (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.12-2.58) about off-label prescribing and antidepressant use (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.25-7.10) increased the odds of patient refusal of off-label prescribing; however, prescribers' years in practice decreased the odds (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-1).\nOff-label prescribing of psychotropic medications is common among child and adolescent psychiatrists in Japan. Furthermore, the psychiatrists' experiences with patient refusal of off-label prescribing were significantly associated with informing the parents/patients about off-label prescribing, particularly with regard to use of antidepressants.

Seventeen certified interviewers conducted 231 interviews (interviewers conducted several interviews; interviewees were only questioned once). Interviewees and interviewers anonymously rated their acceptance right after the interview was finished. The nested data structure was analysed regarding an individual interviewer bias and potential predictors of overall satisfaction. Therefore, factors improvable by interviewer training were included, as well as fixed factors which cannot be improved by professional training. The overall satisfaction was evaluated as highly positive with significant higher interviewee and interviewer ratings in the research as compared to the clinical recruitment setting. An individual bias of the interviewer on his or her own acceptance over time, but not on the evaluation of the corresponding interviewee was found. Neither the professional background nor the gender of the interviewer had a significant contribution in predicting these differences. The interviewer model showed no significant change over time and only the interview duration and the interviewee acceptance were significant predictors for interviewer overall satisfaction. Regarding the interviewee model, just the interviewer acceptance was a significant predictor.

Instead, the new compounding remuneration system for psychiatric and psychosomatic inpatient institutions (PEPP) will provide a new framework. The Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss, G-BA) has been given the task of elaborating a directive on the basis of the expiring Psych-PV in order to redefine standards for personnel allocation within this new framework. This task presupposes the existence of reliable data in the psychiatric hospitals and departments for categorizing patients following the Psych-PV. It presupposes further that these data allow an exact calculation of the personnel to which the clinics are entitled. This article shows that the so-called \u00a7-21 dataset from the database of the VIPP project (indicators of patient care in psychiatric and psychosomatic facilities) allows this calculation. The VIPP dataset was used as a basis to calculate the personnel requirements. Exemplary analyses illustrate that the information available regarding the Psych-PV can be transformed in minutes per day, minutes per month and full time positions.

Further, approximately 500,000 patients are admitted to psychiatric hospitals as an emergency. The most frequent reasons are intoxication, agitation, aggressiveness and suicidal ideation, posing a threat of self-harm to the patient or to other persons and evoking other life-threatening conditions. Emergency psychiatry also plays a role in collective injuries, such as mass disasters, catastrophes and rampage situations. There is some evidence that the number of psychiatric emergencies is increasing.

Such comparisons typically yield estimates of what we refer to as 'standard indices of diagnostic accuracy', including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value. However, whereas these statistics were originally designed to detect binary signals (e.g., diagnosis present or absent), screening questionnaires commonly used in psychology, psychiatry, and pediatrics typically result in ordinal scores. Thus, a threshold or 'cut score' must be applied to these ordinal scores before accuracy can be evaluated using such standard indices. To better understand the tradeoffs inherent in choosing a particular threshold, we discuss the concept of 'threshold probability'. In contrast to PPV, which reflects the probability that a child whose score falls at or above the screening threshold has the condition of interest, threshold probability refers specifically to the likelihood that a child whose score is equal to a particular screening threshold has the condition of interest.\nThe diagnostic accuracy and threshold probability of two well-validated behavioral assessment instruments, the Child Behavior Checklist Total Problem Scale and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire total scale were examined in relation to a structured psychiatric interview in three de-identified datasets.\nAlthough both screening measures were effective in identifying groups of children at elevated risk for psychopathology in all samples (odds ratios ranged from 5.2 to 9.7), children who scored at or near the clinical thresholds that optimized sensitivity and specificity were unlikely to meet criteria for psychopathology on gold standard interviews.\nOur results are consistent with the view that screening instruments should be interpreted probabilistically, with attention to where along the continuum of positive scores an individual falls."}, {"Title": "Lauren Slater and the Experts: Malingering, Masquerade, and the Disciplinary Control of Diagnosis.", "Abstract": "The work of psychologist and author Lauren Slater has elicited strong reactions from both medical professionals and disability studies theorists, ranging from criticism to high praise.

Arthur G. Lipman, Editor ABSTRACT Abusers of prescription opioids represent two distinct populations: those who develop addiction via opioids prescribed for pain, and those for whom prescription opioids represent a primary drug of abuse. Regardless of the pathway to abuse, outcomes for patients with untreated opioid addiction are poor, and consideration of the contextual factors surrounding their problematic use is critical to effective treatment. Reviewed are patterns of prescription opioid abuse among particularly vulnerable populations in underserved rural communities, and in an effort to prevent problematic use, principles of responsible opioid prescription for chronic pain are outlined so as to decrease the risk for developing addiction."}, {"Title": "An electrophysiological insight into visual attention mechanisms underlying schizotypy.", "Abstract": "A theoretical framework has been put forward to understand attention deficits in schizophrenia (Luck SJ & Gold JM. Biological Psychiatry. 2008; 64:34-39). We adopted this framework to evaluate any deficits in attentional processes in schizotypy. Sixteen low schizotypal (LoS) and 16 high schizotypal (HiS) individuals performed a novel paradigm combining a match-to-sample task, with inhibition of return (using spatially uninformative cues) and memory-guided efficient visual-search within one trial sequence. Behavioural measures and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Behaviourally, HiS individuals exhibited a spatial cueing effect while LoS individuals showed the more typical inhibition of return effect. These results suggest HiS individuals have a relative deficit in rule selection - the endogenous control process involved in disengaging attention from the uninformative location cue. ERP results showed that the late-phase of N2pc evoked by the target stimulus had greater peak latency and amplitude in HiS individuals. This suggests a relative deficit in the implementation of selection - the process of focusing attention onto target features that enhances relevant/suppresses irrelevant inputs. This is a different conclusion than when the same theoretical framework has been applied to schizophrenia, which argues little or no deficit in implementation of selection amongst patients. Also, HiS individuals exhibited earlier onset and greater amplitude of the mismatch-triggered negativity component. In summary, our results indicate deficits of both control and implementation of selection in HiS individuals."}, {"Title": "American Psychiatric Association: Position Statement on Firearm Access, Acts of Violence and the Relationship to Mental Illness and Mental Health Services.", "Abstract": "The American Psychiatric Association, (\"APA\"), with more than 36,000 members at present, is the Nation's leading organization of physicians who specialize in psychiatry.

However, it is unclear whether this applies in the area of post-communist Central and Eastern Europe where mental health care has not been deinstitutionalized yet. The present study aims to examine the rates of suicides among psychiatric patients during and shortly after discharge from inpatient hospitalization in the Czech Republic.\nAll inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations and all suicides committed between 2008 and 2012 have been merged on an individual data basis. The time horizon between the admission and two months after the discharge from inpatient psychiatric facility was utilized and multiple logistic regression was performed to calculate the odds of committing suicide.\nA total of 137,290 inpatients were hospitalized in Czech psychiatric facilities between 2008 and 2012, and 402 of the inpatients committed suicide during the hospitalization or within the 2 months after the discharge. Highly elevated risks of suicides were found to be associated with being a male, having a history of multiple hospitalizations, and having a diagnosis of affective, anxiety, or personality disorder.\nLimitations are related to the design of the study, and its reliance on routinely collected data. Also, it was not possible to assess the odds of suicide associated with inpatient psychiatric hospitalization against the odds of suicide in general population.\nDuring psychiatric treatment and recovery, suicial behavior and idealiation is increased. In psychiatry, hospitalization may be a risky period for suicide behavior. Suicide rates during and soon after the psychiatric hospitalization identified in this study from Central and Eastern Europe are similar to the findings from Western Europe. Preventive strategies should be tailored accordingly."}, {"Title": "[Deinstitutionalization in Italian psychiatry - the course and consequences Part II. The consequences of deinstitutionalization].", "Abstract": "The Italian mental health care is based on Law 180 (it. Legge 180), also called Legge Basaglia, from the name of the author of the reform, Franco Basaglia. It was adopted on May 13th 1978. The new legislation resulted from the actions of a strong anti-psychiatric movement and it brought about a major change in the organization of psychiatric care. The reform and its consequences were widely studied by the researchers, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The authors point out many successes of the reform, especially in its beginning. They seek the sources of its failure in a faulty and incomplete implementation. Legge Basaglia completely changed the structure of mental health care in Italy, finally bringing psychiatry back to medicine and the general hospitals, as well as promoting community-based psychiatry. Deinstitutionalization in Italy was not related to an increase in compulsory psychiatric hospitalizations, suicide attempts by the mentally ill, nor did it raise the number of crimes committed by them. It also did not cause common trans-institutionalization, with the transfer of patients to the private sector, as predicted by its opponents."}, {"Title": "[Deinstitutionalization in Italian psychiatry - the course and consequences Part I. The course of deinstitutionalization - the activity of Basaglia's group].", "Abstract": "Psychiatric reform in Italy consisted of the implementation of legislative changes derived from anti-institutional experiments conducted by Franco Basaglia and his group in the 60's and 70's of the 20th century. The activity of Basaglia's group was an integral part of the European reform movement of that time, which profited from the economic, cultural and political prosperity for changes in psychiatry. Italian antipsychiatry has led to the most radical experiment in deinstitutionalization in history. It involved the whole public sector of psychiatry and across a quarter-century resulted in a grand social debate on the situation of the mentally ill and the need for systemic change of their treatment and care. Inspired mainly by phenomenological analysis, Basaglia opted for close emphatic contact with the mentally ill. While the British, French and American anti-psychiatrists contested the psychiatric care system as such, the Italian radicals made an approach to disassemble it from the inside and successfully gained social support for the process of deinstitutionalization. Basaglia promoted his ideas across Europe, including the World Health Organization (WHO) forum."}, {"Title": "[From the editor].", "Abstract": "Dear Readers We are happy and proud to announce that we managed to achieve intention announced in the last issue: for the first time in PubMed there is a possibility of direct and free access to the full texts published in Polish Psychiatry (Polish and English language versions are available)!!! For the issue 6/2014 they have been downloaded by Medline users already 500 times. Owing to this, papers by Polish scientists-psychiatrists are more readily available to colleagues from around the world interested in them, and Polish Psychiatry actually becomes journal of international scope. We hope that it will result in a marked improvement in the bibliometric indicators (which, however, is unrealistic to expect in the current or next year) in the following years. Spring issue of Polish Psychiatry touches several important problems. We pay attention to the texts on addiction - behavioural (Internet addiction) and alcohol. Two papers by prof. M. Wojnar's team summarize the issues related to the coexistence of alcohol dependence with other psychiatric disorders. The issue of dual diagnosis has already appeared in our magazine (for example [1]). This is an extremely difficult problem, and patients are a real challenge, both therapeutic and diagnostic. They often require a comprehensive approach: pharmacotherapy of comorbid mental illness, psychoeducation, addiction treatment programmes. For these patients the maintenance of abstinence is particularly difficult, especially in a situation of exacerbation of psychopathological symptoms. An important direction is searching for additional pharmacotherapeutic methods which help to reduce the degree of alcohol abuse and the resulting damage. These include: acamprosate, drugs which are opioid receptor antagonists [2], and in the current issue the authors from the University of Cagliari focused on baclofen.

A detailed review of patient medical records was performed for all alert events generated when a physician prescribed a dopamine receptor antagonist concurrently with a dopamine receptor agonist in hospitalized patients. Two movement disorders neurologists determined the appropriateness of each prescription, based on patient medical history, through consensus. Physician response to alert was compared by indication for the prescription and physician specialty.\nOf 237 orders, 197 (83.1%) prescriptions for dopamine receptor antagonists were considered inappropriate. The prevalence of inappropriate dopamine receptor antagonist prescriptions per levodopa prescriptions was 16.10% (95% confidence interval 9.47, 22.73) in psychiatry, 7.51% (6.16, 8.86) in general medicine, 6.14% (4.49, 7.79) in the surgical specialties, and 0.85% (0.46, 1.25) in the neurologic/neurosurgical specialties. Of the inappropriate prescriptions, 146 (74.1%) were continued despite the alert. The strongest predictor of discontinuation of dopamine receptor antagonist medications was use of the medication to treat nausea or emesis (p < 0.001).\nDespite successfully identifying instances when dopamine antagonists were prescribed to patients with dopamine-requiring diseases, the alert system modestly affected physician prescribing behavior, highlighting the need for improved education of health care providers."}, {"Title": "Training Child Psychiatrists in Family-Based Integrated Care.", "Abstract": "Family-based assessment and intervention are essential skills for child psychiatrists that are often neglected in fellowship training.

Implications for Residency Training.", "Abstract": "In the changing landscape of healthcare the number of psychiatrists entering leadership positions has declined steadily over the years. One factor contributing to this appears to be lack of leadership training during residency training. International competency frameworks have addressed this and some programs, both national and international, have designed innovative curricula to provide didactic and experiential learning in administration during and after residency. Despite guidelines by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education regarding competency in administrative aspects of health care delivery, most psychiatrists feel ill-equipped to assume a leadership position after residency training. Inculcating comprehensive administrative training into residency faces many challenges related to funding and saturation of existing curricula. Administrative training should be a mandatory element in the training of all residents irrespective of the setting in which they intend to practice. Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education should consider taking a prescriptive approach in shaping competency frameworks to address the need for residents to be fluent in administrative aspects of practice. Training psychiatrist-administrators will be crucial in the future of mental health-care, both from the perspective of consumers as well as psychiatry as a specialty."}, {"Title": "Social Skills: Adolf Meyer's Revision of Clinical Skill for the New Psychiatry of the Twentieth Century.", "Abstract": "Adolf Meyer (1866-1950) exercised considerable influence over the development of Anglo-American psychiatry during the first half of the twentieth century. The concepts and techniques he implemented at his prominent Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins remain important to psychiatric practice and neuro-scientific research today. In the 1890s, Meyer revised scientific medicine's traditional notion of clinical skill to serve what he called the 'New Psychiatry', a clinical discipline that embodied social and scientific ideals shared with other 'new' progressive reform movements in the United States. This revision conformed to his concept of psychobiology - his biological theory of mind and mental disorders - and accorded with his definition of scientific medicine as a unity of clinical-pathological methods and therapeutics. Combining insights from evolutionary biology, neuron theory and American pragmatist philosophy, Meyer concluded that subjective experience and social behaviour were functions of human biology. In addition to the time-honoured techniques devised to exploit the material data of the diseased body - observing and recording in the clinic, dissecting in the morgue and conducting histological experiments in the laboratory - he insisted that psychiatrists must also be skilled at wielding social interaction and interpersonal relationships as investigative and therapeutic tools in order to conceptualise, collect, analyse and apply the ephemeral data of 'social adaptation'. An examination of his clinical practices and teaching at Johns Hopkins between 1913 and 1917 shows how particular historical and intellectual contexts shaped Meyer's conceptualisation of social behaviour as a biological function and, subsequently, his new vision of clinical skill for twentieth-century psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Neither Physicians Nor Surgeons: Whither Neuropathological Skill in Post-war England?", "Abstract": "Neuropathologists constituted a small field in post-war England, perched between neurology, psychiatry, neurosurgery and pathology, but recognised as a discrete field of expertise.

A discourse of skills, acquired and acquirable, became central to their attempts to situate the field in relation to surgeons' handicraft, physicians' diagnostic acumen and the technologies of the biological sciences."}, {"Title": "Metaphor in psychosis: on the possible convergence of Lacanian theory and neuro-scientific research.", "Abstract": "Starting from the theories of leading psychiatrists, like Kraepelin and de Cl\u00e9rambault, the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan (1901-1981) formulated an original theory of psychosis, focusing on the subject and on the structuring role of language. In particular, he postulated that language makes up the experience of subjectivity and that psychosis is marked by the absence of a crucial metaphorization process. Interestingly, in contemporary psychiatry there is growing empirical evidence that schizophrenia is characterized by abnormal interpretation of verbal and non-verbal information, with a great difficulty to put such information in the appropriate context. Neuro-scientific contributions have investigated this difficulty suggesting the possibility of interpreting schizophrenia as a semiotic disorder which makes the patients incapable of understanding the figurative meaning of the metaphoric speech, probably due to a dysfunction of certain right hemisphere areas, such as the right temporoparietal junction and the right superior/middle temporal gyrus. In this paper we first review the Lacanian theory of psychosis and neuro-scientific research in the field of symbolization and metaphoric speech. Next, we discuss possible convergences between both approaches, exploring how they might join and inspire one another. Clinical and neurophysiological research implications are discussed."}, {"Title": "Profiling School Shooters: Automatic Text-Based Analysis.", "Abstract": "School shooters present a challenge to both forensic psychiatry and law enforcement agencies. The relatively small number of school shooters, their various characteristics, and the lack of in-depth analysis of all of the shooters prior to the shooting add complexity to our understanding of this problem. In this short paper, we introduce a new methodology for automatically profiling school shooters. The methodology involves automatic analysis of texts and the production of several measures relevant for the identification of the shooters. Comparing texts written by 6 school shooters to 6056 texts written by a comparison group of male subjects, we found that the shooters' texts scored significantly higher on the Narcissistic Personality dimension as well as on the Humilated and Revengeful dimensions. Using a ranking/prioritization procedure, similar to the one used for the automatic identification of sexual predators, we provide support for the validity and relevance of the proposed methodology."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric symptoms in glioma patients: from diagnosis to management.", "Abstract": "Patients with primary intrinsic brain tumors can experience neurological, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms that greatly affect daily life.

Typically observed in a therapeutic trial, the placebo effect may have a major influence on the effectiveness of rTMS. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the magnitude of the placebo effect observed in controlled studies of rTMS treatment of AVH, and to determine factors that can impact the magnitude of this placebo effect, such as study design considerations and the type of sham used.The study included twenty-one articles concerning 303 patients treated by sham rTMS. A meta-analytic method was applied to obtain a combined, weighted effect size, Hedges's g. The mean weighted effect size of the placebo effect across these 21 studies was 0.29 (P < .001). Comparison of the parallel and crossover studies revealed distinct results for each study design; placebo has a significant effect size in the 13 parallel studies (g = 0.44, P < 10(-4)), but not in the 8 crossover studies (g = 0.06, P = .52). In meta-analysis of the 13 parallel studies, the 45\u00b0 position coil showed the highest effect size. Our results demonstrate that placebo effect should be considered a major source of bias in the assessment of rTMS efficacy. These results fundamentally inform the design of further controlled studies, particularly with respect to studies of rTMS treatment in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy: A system disorder of the brain.", "Abstract": "The prevailing understanding of generalized epilepsy is shaped by the traditional definition that \"the responsible neuronal discharge takes place, if not throughout the entire grey matter, then at least in the greater part of it and simultaneously on both sides\". This view is no longer tenable since concurrent findings using multiple methods have accumulated to reveal the role of bilateral networks of distributed and selective cortical and subcortical structures in so-called generalized ictogenesis. Most of this research has been focused on juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), which today is commonly considered the archetypical syndrome of the idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Based upon recent research in the fields of clinical epileptology, neuropsychology and psychiatry, clinical neurophysiology, neuroimaging and epilepsy genetics this article, for the first time, unites these new findings into a comprehensive nosological view.

The feasibility of fMRI-NF in healthy subjects has been documented for a variety of brain areas and neural systems, and this technique has also been proposed for the treatment of psychiatric disorders in recent years. Through a systematic review of the scientific literature this paper probes the rationale and expected applications of fMRI-NF in psychiatry, discusses issues that must be addressed in the use of this technique to treat mental disorders. Six relevant references and five ongoing studies were identified according to our inclusion criteria. These studies show that in most psychiatric disorders (major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, addiction), patients are able to learn voluntary control of the neuronal activity of the targeted brain region(s). Interestingly, in some cases, this learning is associated with clinical improvement, showing that fMRI-NF can potentially be developed into a therapeutic tool. However, only low-level evidence is available to support the use of this relatively new technique in clinical practice. Notably, no randomized, controlled trial is currently available in this field of research. Finally, methodological issues and clinical perspectives (especially the potential use of pattern recognition in fMRI-NF protocols) are discussed."}, {"Title": "Collaborative Depression Care in a Safety Net Medical Home: Facilitators and Barriers to Quality Improvement.", "Abstract": "Little is known about how to integrate primary care with mental/behavioral services outside of clinical trials.

The effect of psychological counseling is limited, with significant but very slight improvements in psychometric measures of fatigue and disability but no improvement on scientific measures of physical impairment compared to controls. Similarly, exercise regimes either produce significant, but practically unimportant, benefit or provoke symptom exacerbation. Many such patients are afforded the exclusionary, non-specific diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome if rudimentary testing fails to discover the cause of their symptoms. More sophisticated investigations often reveal the presence of a range of pathogens capable of establishing life-long infections with sophisticated immune evasion strategies, including Parvoviruses, HHV6, variants of Epstein-Barr, Cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma, and Borrelia burgdorferi. Other patients have a history of chronic fungal or other biotoxin exposure. Herein, we explain the epigenetic factors that may render such individuals susceptible to the chronic pathology induced by such agents, how such agents induce pathology, and, indeed, how such pathology can persist and even amplify even when infections have cleared or when biotoxin exposure has ceased. The presence of active, reactivated, or even latent Herpes virus could be a potential source of intractable fatigue accompanied by profound physical and or cognitive disability in some patients, and the same may be true of persistent Parvovirus B12 and mycoplasma infection. A history of chronic mold exposure is a feasible explanation for such symptoms, as is the presence of B. burgdorferi. The complex tropism, life cycles, genetic variability, and low titer of many of these pathogens makes their detection in blood a challenge.

Low resting HRV has been linked to several mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and alcohol dependence (Kemp et al. in Biological Psychiatry 67(11):1067-1074, 2010. doi:10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.12.012; Kemp et al. in PloS One, 7(2):e30777, 2012; Quintana et al. in Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 132(1-2):395-398, 2013. doi:10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2013.02.025). HRV has also been used as a method for indexing the relative balance of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity to parasympathetic nervous system activity. This balance--in particular, moderately dominant SNS activity--has been shown to play a significant role in women's genital sexual arousal in the laboratory; however, the role of SNS activity in clinically relevant sexual arousal function is unknown. The present study assessed the feasibility of using HRV as an index of women's self-reported sexual arousal function outside the laboratory. Sexual arousal function, overall sexual function, and resting HRV were assessed in 72 women, aged 18-39. Women with below average HRV were significantly more likely to report sexual arousal dysfunction (p < .001) and overall sexual dysfunction (p < .001) than both women with average HRV and women with above average HRV. In conclusion, low HRV may be a risk factor for female sexual arousal dysfunction and overall sexual dysfunction."}, {"Title": "Psychoanalysis in Crisis: The Danger of Ideology.", "Abstract": "Psychoanalysis is in crisis. Its prestige with the public has plummeted, as well as its economic viability and even its population. There are fewer analytic candidates and fewer patients, less insurance coverage, less presence in departments of psychiatry, and less prestige among the traditional academic disciplines. Analysts are getting older, and there are fewer and fewer young ones to replace us. A once-fascinated public now distrusts analysts as unscientific, deluded, authoritarian, reactionary, arrogant, sexist, and/or pass\u00e9. This paper examines some causes of this decline within psychoanalysis itself as well as possibilities for reform. The status of psychoanalysis as a science is in question, although Freud considered it as an empirical science, and modified his theories to fit new facts. In reality, however, transmission of psychoanalytic knowledge in the training analyst system has led to its perpetuation as an ideology, rather than a science, and to the formation of oligarchies in the structure of psychoanalytic organizations and some institutes. Psychoanalysis is nothing if not an exploratory endeavor, and it thrives in an open environment. Psychoanalytic theory becomes ideology when exploration, testing, and challenge are suppressed. There are many analysts for whom psychoanalysis is neither ideology or theology, but an intellectually stimulating and emotionally rewarding human and humane endeavor, where convention is enlivened by creative challenge, and innovation is disciplined by tradition. In that form, it is too valuable to lose. It is time for us to step back and reclaim our citizenship in the larger intellectual world of curiosity, creativity, and freedom."}, {"Title": "Person-Centered Care in the Home Setting for Parkinson's Disease: Operation House Call Quality of Care Pilot Study.", "Abstract": "Objective. (1) To evaluate the feasibility of implementing and evaluating a home visit program for persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) in a rural setting. (2) To have movement disorders fellows coordinate and manage health care delivery. Background. The University of Florida, Center for Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration established Operation House Call to serve patients with PD who could not otherwise afford to travel to an expert center or to pay for medical care. PD is known to lead to significant disability, frequent hospitalization, early nursing home placement, and morbidity. Methods. This was designed as a quality improvement project. Movement disorders fellows travelled to the home(s) of underserved PD patients and coordinated their clinical care. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was confirmed using standardized criteria, and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale was performed and best treatment practices were delivered. Results. All seven patients have been followed up longitudinally every 3 to 6 months in the home setting, and they remain functional and independent. None of the patients have been hospitalized for PD related complications. Each patient has a new updatable electronic medical record. All Operation House Call cases are presented during video rounds for the interdisciplinary PD team to make recommendations for care (neurology, neurosurgery, neuropsychology, psychiatry, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and social work). One Operation House Call patient has successfully received deep brain stimulation (DBS). Conclusion. This program is a pilot program that has demonstrated that it is possible to provide person-centered care in the home setting for PD patients. This program could provide a proof of concept for the construction of a larger visiting physician or nurse program."}, {"Title": "An update on the epigenetics of psychotic diseases and autism.", "Abstract": "The examination of potential roles of epigenetic alterations in the pathogenesis of psychotic diseases have become an essential alternative in recent years as genetic studies alone are yet to uncover major gene(s) for psychosis. Here, we describe the current state of knowledge from the gene-specific and genome-wide studies of postmortem brain and blood cells indicating that aberrant DNA methylation, histone modifications and dysregulation of micro-RNAs are linked to the pathogenesis of mental diseases. There is also strong evidence supporting that all classes of psychiatric drugs modulate diverse features of the epigenome.

These are 3-4-h sessions chosen by students from a list of over 900. Students are required to complete ten LOCS in each of their first 2 years of medical school, with at least one per year being in psychiatry. The objective of this study was to evaluate the educational experience of students undertaking LOCS in psychiatry, in part to understand whether this experience affects student understanding of psychiatry and the likelihood that they will pursue it as a career.\nA mixed methods approach was used. Qualitative focus group discussions were conducted with medical students to explore perceptions of psychiatry and experiences of psychiatry LOCS. Findings informed the development of a structured quantitative survey aimed at a larger sample of students.\nSix qualitative themes emerged: (1) limited exposure to psychiatry, (2) organizational issues, (3) positive LOCS experiences, (4) stigma, (5) anticipated emotional burden, (6) psychiatry at odds with current understanding of medicine. Questionnaire data showed that psychiatry is not a popular future career choice when compared to other specialties. Psychiatry LOCS are extremely popular with students and have a positive effect on their understanding of the specialty but did little to influence their stated likelihood of pursuing psychiatry as a career.\nEarly exposure to clinical psychiatry through LOCS gives students positive experiences, which improve understanding and awareness of psychiatry. They do not, however, affect stated career intentions for psychiatry as a profession."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry Residents' Use of Educational Websites: A Pilot Survey Study.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry residents have numerous online educational resources readily available to them although currently there are no data regarding residents' use and perception of such websites.\nA survey was offered to 62 residents from all four years of training as well as recent graduates of a single psychiatry residency training program.\nResidents reported utilizing online resources on average 68 % of the time, in comparison to 32 % on average for printed materials. Residents reported UpToDate, PubMed, and Wikipedia as the most visited websites and ranked each highly but for different purposes. Thirty-five percent of residents felt that insufficient faculty guidance was a barrier to use of these educational websites.\nPilot data indicate psychiatry residents use online resources daily for their education in various settings. Resident perceptions of individual website's trustworthiness, ease of use, and sources of clinical decision-making and personal learning suggest potential opportunities for educators to better understand the current use of these resources in residency training. Reported barriers including lack of faculty guidance suggest opportunities for academic psychiatry.

Needs assessment exemplified by the nursing profession in Germany].", "Abstract": "The Psychiatry Personnel Act (Psych-PV) as the basis for personnel assessment in psychiatry becomes invalid on 1 January 2019. Because the Psych-PV previously coupled the personnel quota with the intensity of services provided, current efforts are required to develop an instrument to adapt the extent of financed personnel resources to the manifold new legal requirements and advances in treatment in terms of guideline-based care.\nBased on a literature search and the additional use of a databank of routine data, an example of a calculation was made to estimate the additional personnel resources which would be necessary for psychoeducation and fulfill the legal requirements from 2019 onwards. An investigation was also carried out to identify which psychiatry guidelines contain time values which can be used for calculation of personnel requirements.\nA three-step approach was used: (1) screening of the current guidelines and determination of the average intervention times with respect to nursing staff, (2) exemplary comparison between the times for guideline-based psychoeducation for patients in the diagnosis groups F32-F33 with the times allocated by the Psych-PV and (3) determination of times between education measures prescribed by law and necessary training for which no (sufficient) time contingents are provided in the Psych-PV.\nTimes for individual activities (e.g. psychoeducation), which are also appropriate for nursing personnel can be found in the primary literature on guidelines; however, these include only a small proportion of tasks undertaken by nursing personnel. For psychoeducation it could be shown that additional time contingents would be necessary in the Psych-PV. Furthermore, there are new mandatory but disregarded schooling measures and instructions for nursing staff, the duration of which can be conservatively calculated as 21\u00a0min per case per hospital stay.\nThe empirical approach presented in this study shows the possibility to identify time resources needed for nursing personnel to provide guideline-based interventions; however, these represent only partial aspects of nursing activities. Further research and analytical methods are needed to calculate the currently needed personnel resources for all nursing activities and other professional groups involved in treatment in inpatient psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Single or double moral standards? Professional ethics of psychiatrists regarding self-determination, rights of third parties and involuntary treatment].", "Abstract": "The current intensive discussion on the legal and moral aspects of involuntary treatment of psychiatric patients raises a number of ethical issues. Physicians are unambiguously obligated to protect patient welfare and autonomy; however, in psychiatric patients disease-related restrictions in the capacity of self-determination and behaviors endangering the rights of third parties can seriously challenge this unambiguity. Therefore, psychiatry is assumed to have a double function and is also obligated to third parties and to society in general. Acceptance of such a kind of double obligation carries the risk of double moral standards, placing the psychiatrist ethically outside the community of physicians and questioning the unrestricted obligation towards the patient. The present article formulates a moral position, which places the psychiatrist, like all other physicians, exclusively on the side of the patient in terms of professional ethics and discusses the practical problems arising from this moral position."}, {"Title": "From culture to symptom: Testing a structural model of \"Chinese somatization\".", "Abstract": "\"Chinese somatization\" has been frequently discussed over the past three decades of cultural psychiatry, and has more recently been demonstrated in cross-national comparisons. Empirical studies of potential explanations are lacking, however. Ryder and Chentsova-Dutton (2012) proposed that Chinese somatization can be understood as a cultural script for depression, noting that the literature is divided on whether this script primarily involves felt bodily experience or a stigma-avoiding communication strategy. Two samples from Hunan province, China-one of undergraduate students (n = 213) and one of depressed psychiatric outpatients (n\u2009=\u2009281)-completed the same set of self-report questionnaires, including a somatization questionnaire developed in Chinese. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that Chinese somatization could be understood as two correlated factors: one focusing on the experience and expression of distress, the other on its conceptualization and communication. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that traditional Chinese cultural values are associated with both of these factors, but only bodily experience is associated with somatic depressive symptoms. This study takes a first step towards directly evaluating explanations for Chinese somatization, pointing the way to future multimethod investigations of this cultural script."}, {"Title": "Validation of the brief version of the Recovery Self-Assessment (RSA-B) using Rasch measurement theory.", "Abstract": "In psychiatry, the recovery paradigm is increasingly identified as the overarching framework for service provision. Currently, the Recovery Self-Assessment (RSA), a 36-item rating scale, is commonly used to assess the uptake of a recovery orientation in clinical services. However, the consumer version of the RSA has been found challenging to complete because of length and the reading level required. In response to this feedback, a brief 12-item version of the RSA was developed (RSA-B). This article describes the development of the modified instrument and the application of traditional psychometric analysis and Rasch Measurement Theory to test the psychometrics properties of the RSA-B.\nData from a multisite study of adults with serious mental illnesses (n = 1256) who were followed by assertive community treatment teams were examined for reliability, clinical meaning, targeting, response categories, model fit, reliability, dependency, and raw interval-level measurement. Analyses were performed using the Rasch Unidimensional Measurement Model (RUMM 2030).\nAdequate fit to the Rasch model was observed (\u03c72 = 112.46, df = 90, p = .06) and internal consistency was good (r = .86). However, Rasch analysis revealed limitations of the 12-item version, with items covering only 39% of the targeted theoretical continuum, 2 misfitting items, and strong evidence for the 5 option response categories not working as intended.\nThis study revealed areas for improvement in the shortened version of the 12-item RSA-B.

If detected early, it is reversible. Despite its prevalence and associated morbidity in clinical practice, it remains underrecognized and therefore undertreated. The 24-hour urine collection is limited by its convenience and practicality. This study explores the diagnostic accuracy of alternative tests such as questionnaires on subjective polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia (dichotomous and ordinal responses), early morning urine sample osmolality (EMUO), and fluid intake record (FIR). This is a cross-sectional study of 179 lithium-treated patients attending a general adult and an old age psychiatry service. Participants completed the tests after completing an accurate 24-hour urine collection. The diagnostic accuracy of the individual tests was explored using the appropriate statistical techniques. Seventy-nine participants completed all of the tests. Polydipsia severity, EMUO, and FIR significantly differentiated the participants with polyuria (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.646, 0.760, and 0.846, respectively). Of the tests investigated, the FIR made the largest significant change in the probability that a patient experiences polyuria (<2000 mL/24 hours; interval likelihood ratio, 0.18 and >3500 mL/24 hours; interval likelihood ratio, 14). Symptomatic questioning, EMUO, and an FIR could be used in clinical practice to inform the prescriber of the probability that a lithium-treated patient is experiencing polyuria."}, {"Title": "Philosophical and Psychopathological Perspective of Exile: On Time and Space Experiences.", "Abstract": "This article addresses the experience of exile from an interdisciplinary perspective (philosophy and psychiatry).

The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the clinical variables of BD and childhood trauma using the factor structure, psychometric features, and potential subdimensions of the Dissociative Experience Scale (DES).\nThis study included 200 BD patients who were in a remission period and 50 healthy volunteers. The BD patients were recruited from two psychiatry clinic departments in Turkey. The sociodemographic data of the two groups and their scores on the DES and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ)-28 were compared.\nThe overall DES scores and the scores for each DES item accurately and reliably measured dissociation in the BD patients (item-total correlation r scores: >0.20, Cronbach's alpha: 0.95), and a factor analysis revealed two subdimensions of the DES for BD: identity confusion/alteration (SubDES-1) and amnesia and depersonalization/derealization (SubDES-2). Although age at onset of BD was significantly correlated with both subdimensions, illness duration was significantly correlated only with the SubDES-2. Of all the subjects, 19.5% (39/200 patients) were identified as having dissociative experiences by the DES-Taxon (DES-T), and subjects in this subscale (DES-T-positive) had significantly higher total scores on the CTQ-28 as well as higher scores on each subgroup of this scale. The highest CTQ-28 subgroup score was emotional neglect, which was followed by emotional abuse and physical neglect and then sexual abuse and physical abuse. There was a significant correlation between total scores on the CTQ-28 and SubDES-2 but none of the CTQ-28 subscale scores was significantly correlated with either SubDES-1 or SubDES-2.\nThe DES sufficiently and reliably identified the experience of dissociative symptoms on the part of BD patients, and a factor analysis revealed two subdimensions of BD on this scale. In particular, DES-T-positive subjects experienced a greater amount of childhood trauma and, as a result, had an earlier age at onset of BD. Additionally, SubDES-2, which was associated with amnesia and depersonalization/derealization, was closely related to illness duration."}, {"Title": "Policies and Consequences: How America and Psychiatry Took the Detour to Erewhon.", "Abstract": "In the mid-1960s, federal legislation provided psychiatry with funds for construction and initial staffing of local community mental health programs and funded university psychiatry departments to support research, innovations, and education in social-community psychiatry.

Given the great responsibility conferred on physicians by recent laws allowing PAS, a careful examination of this subject is warranted by psychiatrists and other specialists who may be consulted during a patient's request for PAS. In this article, recent evidence regarding the implementation of PAS in the United States and The Netherlands is reviewed. Support is found for some concerns about PAS, such as the possibility that mental illness occurs at higher rates in patients requesting PAS, but not for other concerns, such as the fear that PAS will be practiced more frequently on vulnerable populations (the slippery-slope argument). These data and common arguments for and against PAS are discussed with an emphasis on the tension between values, such as maximizing patient autonomy and adhering to professional obligations, as well as the need for additional research that focuses more directly on the patient-centered perspective. Implications of the available evidence are discussed and lead to a consideration of mental anguish in terminally ill patients including aspects of existential distress and an acknowledgment of the importance of tailoring end-of-life care to the distinct set of values and experiences that shape each patient's perspective.

Because psychiatric patients are at a higher risk for completing suicide than patients of other specialties, psychiatry residents are at risk for experiencing the suicide of a patient during their training. A review of the literature shows that there is continually growing research into the negative emotional effects of patient suicides on psychiatry residents and the need for clear response protocols when a suicide occurs, also known as postvention protocols. However, there are no Graduate Medical Education requirements to specifically train psychiatry residents about this, even with a well-voiced desire by residents to receive this training. In the National Capitol Consortium Psychiatry Residency, encounters with patient suicides by residents in a time of war led us to a place in which interventions were designed and instituted to care for the caregiver, in this case focusing on psychiatry trainees.

FD is usually classified as a mental disorder involving deliberate and hidden feigning or inducement of illness, in order to achieve patient status. Both the nature of the disorder and the approach to treatment are controversial and under-researched. It is argued that FD should be classified as a mental disorder; may well expose the patient to extreme risk; can warrant paternalistic interventions, in order to fulfil duty of care. Moreover, treatment of FD is inherently paternalistic and therefore raises interesting questions about justifications and type of paternalistic interventions in psychiatry both for FD and in general. A brief account of key questions concerning psychiatry and paternalism is followed by some case histories of FD, the clinical dilemmas posed and the question of how this disorder might warrant paternalistic interventions. In order to answer this question, two things are considered: the legitimacy and character of FD as a mental disorder; possible frameworks for and types of paternalistic interventions. To conclude, it is argued that there are no compelling reasons for rejecting the use of paternalistic interventions for FD, but that further investigation of FD and type and frameworks for psychiatric paternalism, in relation to FD and other mental disorders, are urgently needed."}, {"Title": "Missing link in community psychiatry: When a patient with schizophrenia was expelled from her home.", "Abstract": "Treatment and disposition of homeless patients with schizophrenia represent a great challenge in clinical practice.

Data were collected until saturation. We carried out content analysis of two HTA reports and four other documents that were produced in relation with this HTA. We also used field notes taken during formal meetings and informal discussions with stakeholders. We performed thematic analysis based on a framework for assessing patient involvement in HTA. We then triangulated data.\nFor the majority of interviewees, patient consultation enriched the content of the HTA report and its recommendations. This also made it possible to suggest other alternatives that could reduce the use of restraint and seclusion and helped confirm some views and comments from healthcare professionals consulted in this HTA. The direct participation of patient representatives enabled rephrasing of some findings so as to bring the patient perspective to the HTA report.\nPatient consultation was seen as having directly influenced the content of the HTA report while direct participation made it possible to rephrase some findings.

Because little has been published on Brua, and because patients from Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura\u00e7ao are often reluctant to discuss their commitment to this tradition, they are often misdiagnosed and either over- or undertreated by biomedically trained health professionals. The present paper provides a review of the literature on Brua and its relation to psychiatry. A systematic search was carried out in PubMed, the Ovid database, Google Scholar, and the historical literature. Our search yielded 35 texts on Brua, including three peer-reviewed scientific papers and eight academic theses. From those texts Brua emerges as a holistic patchwork of creolized beliefs and practices which are considered to be both cause and remedy for a wide variety of ailments. Despite the fact that tension between the Brua discourse and Western-oriented psychiatric practice is significant, adherence to Brua does not seem to cause much patient delay in help-seeking.

Residents' involvement was described in four of the programs.\nThese innovative and integrated programs potentially enhance the care of vulnerable and culturally diverse women with major mental disorders. The authors discuss how these programs may contribute to the education of residents in psychiatry and obstetrics-gynecology."}, {"Title": "Involuntary psychiatric admission: The referring general practitioners' assessment of patients' dangerousness and need for psychiatric hospital treatment.", "Abstract": "In Norway, GPs may decide to refer patients to involuntary psychiatric treatment. Internationally, there has been a discussion regarding criteria for involuntary admission. In Norway and in other countries where the treatment criterion is still used, some have suggested its removal.\nTo examine which legal criteria GPs used to refer patients to involuntary admission, whether they had thought about using a different criterion, and on which information they based their decision.\nA total of 74 doctors who had referred patients to involuntary admission at one major Norwegian psychiatric hospital participated in semi-structured interviews.\nIn total, 38% (28) had applied the danger criterion only and 23% (17) had applied the treatment criterion only; 32% (24) had applied both criteria, while 7% (5) did not answer this question; 74% (55) said that they could not have chosen a different criterion; 45% (33) had based their decision on events/behaviour prior to and during the consultation, 43% (32) on events prior to the consultation only, and 8% (6) on information obtained during the consultation only; 4% (3) did not answer this question. None had used tools to aid in the assessment of danger.\nThe danger criterion was frequently used by the referring GPs. It is unclear how a removal of the treatment criterion from Norwegian legislation might impact clinical practice.\nWhile the danger criterion was applied by a majority, the treatment criterion was also chosen by many and was of importance to the doctors' reasoning regarding referrals to involuntary admission. Most thought they could not have chosen a different criterion."}, {"Title": "[Safer Swedish healthcare requires coherent and persistent efforts].", "Abstract": "Despite a development in Swedish patient safety work in recent years, unambiguous results are missing.

Circadian rhythms include all physiological processes displaying a period around 24 hours. Sleep/wake cycles, body temperature, hormone secretion and other functions are subjected to person's individual circadian rhythm. Circadian typology includes three chronotypes: morning, neither and evening. The aim of this study was to examine the chronobiological aspects of depression.\nThis cross-sectional study aimed to determine circadian rhythmic expression in 60 patients suffering from depression. The patients were in remission and were treated as outpatients at the Department of Psychiatry of the University Hospital Center Zagreb. The data were compared to a control group consisting of 40 medical workers employed at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb. A self-report measure of circadian typology was utilized - the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire.\nAccording to our findings, among depressed patients 35% were morning, 58.3% neither and 6.7% evening types. In the control group 46% were morning, 48% neither and 6.0% evening types. Depressed patients reported stronger morning fatigue. Further, they tended to go to sleep earlier and felt more tired earlier in the evening, and they were less prone to choosing morning periods for completing complex cognitive tasks.\nThis study supports the association between depression and some alterations in circadian rhythms of behavior and sleep. Depression may be considered as the consequence or trigger of circadian disturbances. However, both depression and circadian rhythm disturbances may have a common aetiology: a decreased cellular resilience associated with lower resistance to stressful events."}, {"Title": "Numbers of early career psychiatrists vary markedly among European countries.", "Abstract": "In the field of psychiatry the decline of recruitment and brain-drain are currently one of the most discussed topics among stakeholders on national and European level. Even though comprehensive data on psychiatric training in Europe have been already reported, no data are available on even the approximate number of early career psychiatrists (ECPs). With this objective in mind, the Early Career Psychiatrists Committee of the European Psychiatric Association (EPAECPC) and the European Federation of Psychiatric Trainees (EFPT) have undertaken a survey. Based on the methodology used, the total number of ECPs in all European countries was 46 144 with the average number of ECPs being 5.5/100 000 country inhabitants. The actual numbers in this respect varied greatly among countries from 0.4 and 0.6 ECPs/100 000 in Azerbaijan resp. Russia; to 20.4 and 28.4 ECPs/100 000 in Norway resp. Switzerland. An obvious East-West gradient with increasing numbers of ECPs when moving from East to West, and from South to North were found, mirroring the economic strength of European countries. This is the first study to specifically explore the number of ECPs across Europe which might have key implications for planning and establishing recruitment activities and for developing strategies for prevention of brain-drain, such as improvement of educational system and enlargement of professional opportunities."}, {"Title": "Boredom, dopamine, and the thrill of psychosis: psychiatry in a new key.", "Abstract": "Medication non-adherence is a great challenge in the treatment of psychotic disorders. Several factors leading to medication non-adherence in schizophrenia have been identified: drug side-effects, lack of illness insight, negative attitude of the patient and friends/relatives toward medication, stigma of mental illness and taking medication, poor therapeutic alliance, substance abuse, and role of the illness in maintaining the family system. In this work I propose a new vista on the phenomenon of medication non-adherence in psychosis. Rather rule than exception, non-adherence is to be expected in psychosis, it can be considered as a symptom of psychosis similarly as substance craving and use are symptoms of the substance use disorders. Relying on the last refinements of the concepts of boredom, anticipatory anhedonia, intrinsic motivation, and thrill I assume that there is a lure of psychotic episode. In order to escape an extremely unpleasant and distressing experience of boredom and to experience the thrill of psychosis, the patients are prone to quit antipsychotic therapy. The phenomena of boredom and the thrill of psychosis are evident but unexploited for strengthening the therapeutic adherence. Making the lure of psychosis an explicit reason for medication non-adherence would bring to the awareness a personal choice between short-term pleasure of the psychotic thrill and prevention of long-term losses due to a psychotic episode. Neurobiological and psychobiological underpinning of the psychotic thrill has been suggested. An explanation of the pleasure of psychosis and substance use, which overcomes the circular explanation of reward in which dopamine appears as the cause and consequence of reward, has been proposed. The present synthesis can be regarded as a contribution to the field of theoretical psychiatry. It points to a chance for psychiatry to do more for patients' wellbeing and treatment adherence performing in a new key - dealing with boredom and pleasure in patients' everyday life."}, {"Title": "The Role of Positive Personality Traits in Emotion Regulation of Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).", "Abstract": "Personality traits and emotion regulation processes play an important role in human health. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of positive personality traits (psychological hardiness and interpersonal forgiveness) in emotion regulation of patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\nThe research was a cross-sectional study. Statistical population included all of IBS patients referred to the Subspecialty Center of Psychiatry in Isfahan in 2013. Overall, 123 subjects (100 women, 83.3%, and 30 men, 16.7%) were selected by census method, according to criteria of research and during a particularperiod. To collect data, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Lang and Goulet Hardiness Scale (LGHS) and Interpersonal forgiveness Inventory (IFI) were used. Data was analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and Multivariate and Binary Logistic regression analyses.\nMean age of patients was 33.82\u00b110.45 years and 83.3% (100) of them were female. Regression analyses showed that both personality traits of hardiness and forgiveness were as protective factors for emotional dysregulation with OR, 95% CI: 0.93 and 0.96 sequentially, with adjusting demographic variables (age, gender, and education level and disease duration).\nPatients who are more hardy and forgiving toward others, are likely more successful at adaptive emotion regulation. It emphasizes the positive and beneficial role of the personality traits in regulating of emotional problems of IBS patients. Hence, these variables should be considered as effective factors in the treatment process of the patients."}, {"Title": "Correspondence of DNA Methylation Between Blood and Brain Tissue and Its Application to Schizophrenia Research.", "Abstract": "Given the difficulty of procuring human brain tissue, a key question in molecular psychiatry concerns the extent to which epigenetic signatures measured in more accessible tissues such as blood can serve as a surrogate marker for the brain. Here, we aimed (1) to investigate the blood-brain correspondence of DNA methylation using a within-subject design and (2) to identify changes in DNA methylation of brain-related biological pathways in schizophrenia.We obtained paired blood and temporal lobe biopsy samples simultaneously from 12 epilepsy patients during neurosurgical treatment. Using the Infinium 450K methylation array we calculated similarity of blood and brain DNA methylation for each individual separately. We applied our findings by performing gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of peripheral blood DNA methylation data (Infinium 27K) of 111 schizophrenia patients and 122 healthy controls and included only Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites that were significantly correlated across tissues.Only 7.9% of CpG sites showed a statistically significant, large correlation between blood and brain tissue, a proportion that although small was significantly greater than predicted by chance. GSEA analysis of schizophrenia data revealed altered methylation profiles in pathways related to precursor metabolites and signaling peptides.Our findings indicate that most DNA methylation markers in peripheral blood do not reliably predict brain DNA methylation status. However, a subset of peripheral data may proxy methylation status of brain tissue. Restricting the analysis to these markers can identify meaningful epigenetic differences in schizophrenia and potentially other brain disorders."}, {"Title": "Exploring the Relationship between Family Functioning and Psycho-Pathology in a Sample in the Pediatric Age.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in family functioning between families with clinical subjects in paediatric age and families taken from the Italian population.

The non-pathological sample is composed by 2,543 parents in different age periods of the life-cycle. Results showed significant differences in family functioning between pathological and non-pathological samples. Specifically, families from the pathological sample (particularly the ones who experienced eating disorders) were more frequently located in extreme or mid-range regions of Olson's circumplex model (p < .001). These findings suggest some considerations that can be useful in therapeutic works with families in a clinical setting.

In 67 patients, additional version of the scale was also used. Comparative analysis of average results in particular diagnostic groups (organically based disorders, disorders due to psychoactive substance use, psychotic disorders, neurotic disorders and personality disorders) was also carried out, as well as an analysis of the scale's accuracy as a diagnostic test in detecting organic disorders.\nThe reliability of the test measured with between tests correlation coefficient rho=0.92 (P=.000). Significant differences between particular diagnoses groups were detected (J-T=13736; P=.000). The cutoff points of 23 turned out to have a satisfactory sensitivity and specificity (0.82 and 0.70, respectively) in diagnosing organically based disorders. The area below the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC=0.854; P=.000) suggests that MoCA has a satisfactory value as a classifier.\nThe initial data suggest MoCA's high value in prediction of future diagnosis of organically based disorders.

The Workgroup for Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders, chaired by Kenneth J. Zucker, was employed by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) to update the DSM-5's GID diagnosis reflecting contemporary scientific knowledge. Additionally, in a pre-publication report to the APA, members of the Workgroup suggested that they would also be concerned with the destigmatization of transpeople while preserving a diagnosis that medical insurance companies would accept for issuing payments for transitioning treatments (Drescher, 2013). The aims of this article are, firstly, to question whether changing the diagnosis lessens the stigmatization of transpeople. I will suggest that the semantic change from GID to GD marks \"inverted\" gendered expressions as pathological and, thus, continues to stigmatize transpeople. Secondly, the article explores the development of the GD diagnosis, and illustrates how the scientific data this were founded on are contentious. The article then demonstrates how the trans anti-pathologization movement has challenged the perceived pathologizing effects of the DSM-5 classification of GD. The article examines a selection of Western transgender community advocates' websites, forums, and blogs. From these sources, the article then explores the different narratives of transpeople and political groups who offer details of their praxis, and evidences how the trans anti-pathologization advocates use the available science and human rights discourses to contest the role of psychiatry in the treatment of transpeople."}, {"Title": "Evaluating a new model of nurse-led emergency department mental health care in Australia; perspectives of key informants.", "Abstract": "Mental health nurse services have existed in Emergency Departments (ED) for many years.

This review of an array of longitudinal studies supports that they are arguably an essential component of psychiatric investigations, but that they must be coupled with other approaches. The use of standardized, validated, repeated assessments in a disease over the course of time must be incorporated with pathophysiology investigations to identify underlying mechanisms, biomarker studies, comparative effectiveness clinical trials to identify the best treatments for different causes, and translational strategies to provide the right treatments to the right patients at the right time.

Mobile phones are well accepted by students, trainees, and doctors. A review of the current literature has identified the following specialties that have used mobile phones in education: pediatrics, ophthalmology, nephrology, plastic surgery, orthopedics, pharmacology, and urology. However, to date, there are no published papers examining the application of the latest mobile phone technologies for psychiatry education internationally.\nThe main objectives of this study are (1) to determine the feasibility and receptiveness of a locally-developed psychiatry mobile phone app and user perspectives (both quantitative and qualitative) towards it, and (2) to determine the receptiveness of a locally-developed app for psychiatry education internationally.\nA Web-based app that contained textbook contents, videos, and quizzes was developed using HTML5 technologies in 2012. Native apps were subsequently developed in 2013. Information about the apps was disseminated locally to Singaporean medical students, but the respective native apps were made available on the app stores. A user perspective survey was conducted locally to determine student's perception of the app.\nFrom the inception of the app until the time of preparation of this manuscript, there have been a cumulative total of 28,500 unique visits of the responsive HTML5 Web-based mobile phone app. There have been a cumulative total of 2200 downloads of the Mastering Psychiatry app from the Apple app store and 7000 downloads of the same app from the Android app store. The initial user perspective survey conducted locally highlighted that approximately a total of 95.2% (177/186) of students felt that having a psychiatry mobile phone app was deemed to be useful.

The program targets such career skills as writing, negotiating, time management, juggling multiple demanding responsibilities, networking, project management, responsible conduct of research, and career goal setting. The current program builds on the previous program by adding a longitudinal, long-distance, virtual mentoring, and training program, seen as integral components to sustaining these career skills.\nCareer development activities occur in four phases over a 24-month period for each annual class of up to 18 participants: online baseline career and skills self-assessment and goal setting, preparations for 4-day in-person workshop, long-distance structured mentoring and online continued learning, peer-mentoring activities, and post-program career progress and process evaluation. Program instructors and mentors consist of faculty from the University of Pittsburgh and Stanford University as well as successful past program graduates from other universities as peer mentors. A comprehensive website facilitates long-distance activities to occur online. Continued training occurs via webinars every other month by experts discussing topics selected for the needs of each particular class.

RA homeostasis in the adult CNS is tightly controlled through local RA synthesis and cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-mediated inactivation of RA. Here, we hypothesized that minocycline may directly affect RA homeostasis in the CNS via altering local RA degradation.\nWe used in vitro RA metabolism assays with metabolically competent synaptosomal preparations from murine brain and human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells as well as viable human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell cultures.\nWe revealed that minocycline potently blocks RA degradation as measured by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and in a viable RA reporter cell line, even at low micromolar levels of minocycline.\nOur findings provide evidence for enhanced RA signalling to be involved in minocycline's pleiotropic mode of action in the CNS.

This paper uses the methodology of Conversation Analysis to examine how psychiatrists justify their psychiatric treatment recommendations to clients. The analysis is based on audio-recordings of interactions between clients with severe mental illnesses (such as, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, etc.) in a long-term, outpatient intensive community treatment program and their psychiatrist. Our focus is on how practitioners design their accounts (or rationales) for recommending for or against changes in medication type and dosage and the interactional deployment of these accounts. We find that psychiatrists use two different types of accounts: they tailor their recommendations to the clients' concerns and needs (client-attentive accounts) and ground their recommendations in their professional expertise (authority-based accounts). Even though psychiatrists have the institutional mandate to prescribe medications, we show how the use of accounts displays psychiatrists' orientation to building consensus with clients in achieving medical decisions by balancing medical authority with the sensitivity to the treatment relationship."}, {"Title": "[The caregiver's intrusion in psychiatry, interaction or interference?].", "Abstract": "The intrusive nature of care can be examined using a clinical situation experienced bya nurse from a medical-psychological unit caring for a psychotic patient at home.

We examined ultra-high-risk (UHR) symptoms and criteria in a sample of individuals aged 8-40 years from the general population of Canton Bern, Switzerland, enrolled from June 2011 to May 2014. The current presence of attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS) and brief intermittent psychotic symptoms (BLIPS) and the fulfillment of onset/worsening and frequency requirements for these symptoms in UHR criteria were assessed using the Structured Interview for Psychosis Risk Syndromes. Additionally, perceptive and non-perceptive APS were differentiated. Psychosocial functioning and current non-psychotic DSM-IV axis I disorders were also surveyed. Well-trained psychologists performed assessments. Altogether, 9.9% of subjects reported APS and none BLIPS, and 1.3% met all the UHR requirements for APS. APS were related to more current axis I disorders and impaired psychosocial functioning, indicating some clinical significance. A strong age effect was detected around age 16: compared to older individuals, 8-15-year olds reported more perceptive APS, that is, unusual perceptual experiences and attenuated hallucinations. Perceptive APS were generally less related to functional impairment, regardless of age. Conversely, non-perceptive APS were related to low functioning, although this relationship was weaker in those below age 16. Future studies should address the differential effects of perceptive and non-perceptive APS, and their interaction with age, also in terms of conversion to psychosis."}, {"Title": "The effectiveness of psychodynamic psychotherapies: An update.", "Abstract": "This paper provides a comprehensive review of outcome studies and meta-analyses of effectiveness studies of psychodynamic therapy (PDT) for the major categories of mental disorders. Comparisons with inactive controls (waitlist, treatment as usual and placebo) generally but by no means invariably show PDT to be effective for depression, some anxiety disorders, eating disorders and somatic disorders. There is little evidence to support its implementation for post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bulimia nervosa, cocaine dependence or psychosis. The strongest current evidence base supports relatively long-term psychodynamic treatment of some personality disorders, particularly borderline personality disorder. Comparisons with active treatments rarely identify PDT as superior to control interventions and studies are generally not appropriately designed to provide tests of statistical equivalence. Studies that demonstrate inferiority of PDT to alternatives exist, but are small in number and often questionable in design. Reviews of the field appear to be subject to allegiance effects.

That this modest 'provisional description' turned out to be so significant and influential is perhaps unsurprising when the context in which it was made is appreciated. Griffith Edwards and his colleagues at the Maudsley Hospital had undergone a rigorous 3-year training in clinical psychiatry, during which they had been taught to think critically and were grounded in the art of clinical observation. As he assessed patients for various alcohol research studies he realized that there was a clustering of certain elements. Thus clinical observation and an appreciation of the patient's drinking history contributed to the genesis of the concept.

The development of molecular probes that specifically bind biochemical markers and the advances of instrumentation have revolutionized the possibilities to gain insight into the human brain organization and beyond this-visualize structure-function and brain-behavior relationships. The review describes the development and current applications of functional brain imaging techniques with a focus on applications in psychiatry. A historical overview of the development of functional imaging is followed by the portrayal of the principles and applications of positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), two key molecular imaging techniques that have revolutionized the ability to image molecular processes in the brain. We conclude that the juxtaposition of PET and fMRI in hybrid PET/MRI scanners enhances the significance of both modalities for research in neurology and psychiatry and might pave the way for a new area of personalized medicine."}, {"Title": "Latest guidelines for the management of the anxiety disorders - a report from The International Anxiety Disorders Society Conference, Melbourne 2014.", "Abstract": "The International Anxiety Disorders Society Conference, held in Melbourne in November 2014, enabled key researchers from Australia and internationally to interact with mental health practitioners with an interest in clinical anxiety disorders.

A frequent hypothesis is that increased sunlight exposure alters biological mechanisms. However, few attempts have been made to systematically untangle the putative suicidogenic risk of sunlight exposure from that of seasonality. We examined whether average hours of daily sunlight in a month confer additional risk over month of year when predicting monthly suicide rates.\nHistorical population-based ecological longitudinal study.\nWe used 3 longitudinal studies (n=31,060 suicides) with monthly suicide and meteorological data from Greece (1992-2001), Victoria, Australia (1990-1998) and Norway (1969-2009).\nWe used a negative binomial regression to observe (1) the association of month of year with suicides, adjusting for different sunlight exposures, and (2) the association of sunlight exposure with suicides, adjusting for month of year. We then investigated claims that suicides were associated with daily sunlight exposures, defined by us as 2550 sunlight exposure combinations corresponding to a 1-50 days exposure window with lags of 0-50 days.\nUsing monthly data, the association between month of year and suicides remained after adjusting for mean daily hours of sunlight and change in the mean daily hours of sunlight. Adjusted for month of year, the associations between sunlight exposure and suicides became non-significant and attenuated towards the null (the coefficient estimate for mean daily hours of sunlight decreased in absolute magnitude by 72%). The findings were consistent across all 3 cohorts, both when analysed separately and combined. When investigating daily sunlight exposures, we found no significant results after correcting for multiple testing.\nUsing monthly data, the robustness of our month of year effects, combined with the transient and modest nature of our sunlight effects, suggested that the association between sunlight exposure and suicide was a proxy for the association between seasonality and suicide."}, {"Title": "Functional neurologic disorders.", "Abstract": "Functional neurologic disorders, also called psychogenic, nonorganic, conversion, and dissociative disorders, are among the most common problems in neurologic practice.

It exerts rapid mood-elevating activity, similar to antidepressant medications, most likely mediated through both monoaminergic and circadian system melatonergic mechanisms. We assessed the efficiency of bright light therapy as an adjuvant treatment to antidepressant pharmacotherapy in patients with severe MDD randomized by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score to either (1) 150 mg venlafaxine hydrochloride daily at 7:00 AM or (2) 150 mg venlafaxine plus 60-minute light of 7000 lux the initial week of clinical management (venlafaxine + bright light therapy) daily at 7:00 AM.\n50 inpatients with severe MDD at the Psychiatry Clinic of Y\u00fcz\u00fcnc\u00fc Y\u0131l University Training and Education Hospital participated. The study, which was conducted from January 2013 through June 2014, entailed patients diagnosed with severe MDD based on DSM-IV-TR for the first time. Mood states were assessed by the HDRS, Profile of Mood States (POMS), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) before treatment and at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks of treatment.\nOn the basis of the HDRS score as the primary outcome variable, both strategies significantly improved depression and negative mood states already at the first treatment week (P < .001). Differences in therapeutic effects by treatment strategy were remarkable at the second and fourth weeks of clinical management (P = .018 and P = .011, respectively), with beneficial effects continuing until trial conclusion. Those treated with venlafaxine + bright light therapy evidenced significantly lower HDRS depression scores (P < .05) as well as BDI scores (P < .05) and POMS negative mood states scores (depression-dejection, tension-anxiety, anger-hostility, fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewilderment subscales; all P < .05) after the second week. At week 4 of the trial, 19 (76%) of the 25 venlafaxine + bright light therapy patients versus just 11 (44%) of the 25 venlafaxine patients (P < .05) attained the target goal of treatment, a HDRS score \u2264 13, indicative of mild depression, and, although not statistically significant in our small sample study (P = .36), at week 8, 76% of venlafaxine + bright light therapy patients (n = 19) versus just 64% of the venlafaxine patients (n = 16) experienced complete remission of depression (HDRS score \u2264 7).\nBoth venlafaxine and venlafaxine + bright light therapy treatment strategies significantly reversed the depressive mood of patients with severe MDD; however, the latter induced significantly stronger and more rapid beneficial effects.

Surprisingly, little is known about the effect of environmental music on concurrent cognitive functioning and whether young and older adults are differentially affected by music. Here, we investigated the impact of background music on a concurrent paired associate learning task in healthy young and older adults.\nYoung and older adults listened to music or to silence while simultaneously studying face-name pairs. Participants' memory for the pairs was then tested while listening to either the same or different music. Participants also made subjective ratings about how distracting they found each song to be.\nDespite the fact that all participants rated music as more distracting to their performance than silence, only older adults' associative memory performance was impaired by music. These results are most consistent with the theory that older adults' failure to inhibit processing of distracting task-irrelevant information, in this case background music, contributes to their memory impairments.\nThese data have important practical implications for older adults' ability to perform cognitively demanding tasks even in what many consider to be an unobtrusive environment."}, {"Title": "A comparison of mental state examination documentation by junior clinicians in electronic health records before and after the introduction of a semi-structured assessment template (OPCRIT+).", "Abstract": "The mental state examination (MSE) provides crucial information for healthcare professionals in the assessment and treatment of psychiatric patients as well as potentially providing valuable data for mental health researchers accessing electronic health records (EHRs).

Second, we conducted an audit to compare the frequency with which individual components of the MSE were documented in the normal MSEs compared with the OPCRIT+MSEs.\nPDQI-9 ratings indicated that the OPCRIT+MSEs were more 'Thorough', 'Organized', 'Useful' and 'Comprehensible' as well as being of an overall higher quality than the normal MSEs. The audit identified that the normal MSEs contained fewer mentions of the individual components of 'Thought content', 'Anxiety' and 'Cognition & Insight'.\nThese results indicate that a semi-structured assessment template significantly improves the quality of MSE recording by junior doctors within EHRs.

This retrospective study sheds light on these issues by investigating psychosis in a group of 128 Parkinson's disease patients who received DBS implants.\nA retrospective chart review was performed to obtain surgery dates, follow-up clinic visit dates, and associated stimulation parameter settings (contacts in use and the polarity of each along with stimulation voltage, frequency, and pulse width) for each patient.

The data were compiled into a database and analyzed.\nThe lifetime incidence of psychosis in this cohort of patients was 28.1%. The data suggest that risk of psychosis remains fairly constant throughout the first 5 years after implantation of a DBS system and that patients older at the time of receiving the first DBS implant are not only more likely to develop psychosis, but also to develop symptoms sooner than their younger counterparts. Further analysis provides evidence that psychosis is largely independent of the clinically used electrode contact and of stimulation parameters prior to psychosis onset.\nAlthough symptoms of psychosis are widely seen in patients with Parkinson's disease in the years following stimulator placement, results of the present suggest that most psychoses occurring postoperatively are likely independent of implantation and stimulation settings."}, {"Title": "Large-Scale Dissemination of Collaborative Care and Implications for Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The evidence is overwhelming that a collaborative care approach to common mental illnesses is superior to usual care.

The birth of GMH can be traced to London, 2007, with the publication of a series of high-profile papers in The Lancet. Since then, GMH has developed into a movement with proponents, adherents, opponents, an ideology and core activities. The stated aims of the Movement for GMH are 'to improve services for people living with mental health problems and psychosocial disabilities worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries where effective services are often scarce'. GMH could be considered an attempt to right a historic wrong. During the colonial and post-colonial eras, the mental health of subject populations was accorded a very low priority. This was fuelled by scientific racism, which alleged that mental illness was uncommon in places such as Africa. As developing nations have made the epidemiological transition, the burden of mental illness has proportionately increased, with research suggesting a massive 'treatment gap' between those in need and those actually receiving formal mental health care. As such, much GMH research and action has been devoted to: (i) the identification and scale-up of cost-effective evidence-supported interventions that could be made more widely available; (ii) task-shifting of such intervention delivery to mental-health trained non-specialist Lay Health Workers. GMH has come under sustained critique. Critics suggest that GMH is colonial medicine come full circle, involving the top-down imposition of Western psychiatric models and solutions by Western-educated elites. These critiques suggest that GMH ignores the various indigenous modalities of healing present in non-Western cultures, which may be psychologically adaptive and curative.

This survey aimed to examine inpatient experience of MDTMs and identify factors that significantly alter this experience.\nIn this cross-sectional survey we assessed patient opinion regarding patient inclusive MDTMs in a psychiatric inpatient unit. A total of 27 participants (response rate 90%) were included. We utilised descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test for non-parametric data where appropriate.\nIn all, 85% (n=23) of patients identified the consultant psychiatrist as a member that they would like to have present at the MDTM. The ward nurse was identified by 63% (n=17) of patients. In all, 48% (n=13) of patients reported feeling anxious/threatened at the MDTM. In all, 70% (n=19) of patients stated that they would have felt less threatened at the MDTM if there were fewer people in attendance. A significant number of voluntary patients (n=11) felt threatened/anxious at the MDTM compared with involuntary patients (n=2) (\u03c7 2=4.921, df=1, p=0.026).\nThe central findings of this study are that patients would prefer fewer people at the MDTM and would feel less threatened/anxious if they participated in selecting those in attendance. These findings suggest that greater patient involvement in preparation for the MDTM could result in a less anxiety filled experience for them."}, {"Title": "Mother-Child Interactions of Preterm Toddlers.", "Abstract": "We aimed to investigate the mother-toddler relationship in preterm toddlers.\nThe sample consisted of 18 mothers and their preterm toddlers (group 1) and 20 mothers and their fullterm toddlers (group 2). Anxiety and depressive symptom levels, attachment pattern, and parental attitudes of mothers and social-emotional problems and developmental level of the toddlers were explored to assess possible confounding factors in the mother-toddler relationship. Two researchers rated the Parent Infant Relationship Global Assessment Scales (PIRGAS).\nBoth the mothers in group 1 and group 2 had similar Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores. However, the mothers who gave birth before 32 weeks of gestation had higher trait anxiety scores than others (46\u00b12.4 vs. 42.3\u00b15.4, p=0.01). The groups had similar Brief Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment Scale (BITSEA) problem and competency scores. The parenting style of group 1 revealed that they had higher scores on the Parenting Attitude Research Instrument (PARI) subscale 5 (excessive discipline) (39.6 vs. 32.1; p=0.02).\nMother-toddler interaction and attachment security were found to be similar in fullterm and moderately preterm healthy toddlers. Our findings suggest that not the preterm birth itself but the medical, developmental, and/or neurological consequences of prematurity may affect the mother-toddler interaction. To explore the independent effect of prematurity in mother-toddler dyadic relationship, longitudinally designed studies are warranted."}, {"Title": "From Poster Presentation to Publication: National Congress of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The aims of this study were as follows: 1) to determine publication rate, time to publication, and study design of poster presentations accepted at the National Congress of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (NCCAP) and converted to publication and the degree of first author in a published article and journal index and 2) to investigate the relationship of these data with each other.\nThe poster presentations of four congresses organized between 2005 and 2008 were investigated separately. The presentations were screened by taking into account the title and the first and second author in English and Turkish languages via PubMed and Google Academic databases. Published studies, time between presentation and publishing date, study design, degree of first author, and journal index of these studies were recorded.\nFifty-four (25.2%) of 214 poster presentations were published in international and national peer-reviewed journals. Of the published articles, 74.1% (n=40) were research type and 61.1% (n=33) were found in the Science Citation Index (SCI) and Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E) peer-reviewed journals. The first author in 42.6% (n=23) of published articles were assistant professors. The average time between presentation and publishing date was 30.72\u00b118.89 months. Statistical differences were not determined between publication rate and study design; between time to publication and study type/study design, degree of first author, and journal index; and between journal index and study design and degree of first author (p>0.05). It was found that research articles were published significantly more by teaching staff than experts and other researchers (p<0.05).\nCompared with literature data, it was found that the time to publication was longer while the publication rate was similar for poster presentations in our congresses. Based on these results, it is important to create necessary conditions and encourage the researchers to publish the poster presentations presented in NCCAP."}, {"Title": "Forensic psychiatry in Pakistan.", "Abstract": "This article reviews existing forensic psychiatric services in Pakistan highlighting the role played by the judicial and the medical fraternity in managing the legal and forensic issues of the population of patients with mental illnesses. Until 2001, all legal and forensic issues were dealt with the mental health legislation of 1912, the Lunacy Act of 1912. This was inherited from the British rulers in the Sub-Continent at the time. The Mental Health Ordinance of 2001 could not sustain following the 18th constitutional amendment in 2010, whereby psychiatric healthcare was devolved to the provinces from the previous federal authority. The article also highlights the difficulties and the barriers in implementation of the forensic psychiatric services in Pakistan at various levels within the healthcare system. This article also delves into the current framework of training in forensic psychiatry for postgraduates as well as the assessments and management schedules for the mentally ill offenders at tertiary care institutions in Pakistan."}, {"Title": "Ethical Challenges in Psychiatric Administration and Leadership.", "Abstract": "As with all professional ethical principles, those in psychiatry have to evolve over time and societal changes. The current ethical challenges for psychiatric administration and leadership, especially regarding for-profit managed care, need updated solutions. One solution resides in the development by the American Association of Psychiatric Administrators (AAPA) of the first set of ethical principles designed specifically for psychiatric administrators. These principles build on prior Psychological Theories of leadership, such as those of Freud, Kernberg, and Kohut. Supplementing these theories are the actual real life models of psychiatrist leadership as depicted in the memoirs of various psychiatrists. Appreciating these principles, theories, and models may help emerging leaders to better recognize the importance of ethical challenges. A conclusion is that psychiatrists should have the potential to assume more successful leadership positions once again. In such positions, making the skills and well-being of all in the organization seems now to be the foremost ethical priority."}, {"Title": "Modulation of prenatal stress via docosahexaenoic acid supplementation: implications for child mental health.", "Abstract": "Pregnant women living in poverty experience chronic and acute stressors that may lead to alterations in circulating glucocorticoids. Experimental evidence from animal models and correlational studies in humans support the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to high levels of glucocorticoids can negatively affect the developing fetus and later emotional and behavioral regulation in the offspring. In this integrative review, recent findings from research in psychiatry, obstetrics, and animal and human experimental studies on the role of docosahexaenoic acid in modulation of the stress response and brain development are discussed. The potential for an emerging field of nutritionally based perinatal preventive interventions for improving offspring mental health is described. Prenatal nutritional interventions may prove to be effective approaches to reducing common childhood mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Relationships between polypharmacy and the sleep cycle among active-duty service members.", "Abstract": "Sleep disorders are frequent clinical presentations, especially among active-duty service members. Medications are one factor that can affect sleep in many ways.\nTo determine the effect of increasing numbers of medications on the sleep cycle of active-duty service members.\nMedical records for active-duty service members who completed enhanced sleep assessments at the Psychiatry Continuity Service at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center from October 1, 2010, through November 30, 2013, were retrospectively reviewed. Data were collected on home sleep study findings, sleep-related self-report instrument scores, and active medications.\nA total of 135 medical records were reviewed. One hundred patients (74.07%) had an active prescription for a psychoactive drug. Among all patients, the mean (SD) number of active medications per participant was 2.52 (2.09), with 118 patients (82.96%) having an active medication for depression or insomnia. As the number of prescribed medications increased, the percentage of the sleep cycle in deep sleep decreased (P=.049), the percentage of light sleep increased (P=.016), the percentage of rapid eye movement sleep decreased (P=.083), and the first episode of deep sleep was delayed (P=.056). An increased number of medications had no significant impact on total sleep time (P&gt;.05).\nAn increasing number of medications did not influence total sleep time but negatively affected the sleep cycle."}, {"Title": "A Shortage of Medical Residency Positions: Parallels with Psychology.", "Abstract": "Physician shortages in the US are expected to intensify with the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. These shortages may negatively impact access to care, quality of care, and confidence in the system's ability to adequately provide for health needs in the US. Concerns regarding physician demand underscore how critical Graduate Medical Education funding is to preparing the physician workforce. In 2014 5.6 % of US medical school seniors did not match into residency.

The authors summon attention to the damaging effects a training imbalance poses to a health care profession, its trainees, and ultimately the public it serves."}, {"Title": "'The meaning of the symptom in psychiatry. An overview', by Hans W. Gruhle (1913): Introduction by Johan Schioldann and German Berrios: Translation by Johan Schioldann.", "Abstract": "At the beginning of the 20th century there took place in German Psychiatry an important debate on the nature and relative importance of mental symptoms and diseases. Young psychiatrists such as St\u00f6rring, Ziehen, Gaupp, Hoche, Jaspers and Gruhle challenged, from various perspectives, the nosology of established figures such as Kraepelin and Wernicke. The Classic Text is a commented translation of Gruhle's 1913 lecture on the meaning of mental symptoms. After concluding that mental symptoms should be used as the epistemological unit of analysis in psychiatry, Gruhle rued the fact that little was yet known about their inner structure. He believed that any account of the latter should include an account of the 'meaning' of mental symptoms, that is, of their role in the patient's total disease. Gruhle found Freud's account of meaning wanting, but was himself unable to offer a viable alternative. Be that as it may, his concern remains unanswered and is as relevant today as it was in 1913."}, {"Title": "Herculano S\u00e1 de Figueiredo (1911-74): a sculptor in the Conde de Ferreira Hospital, Portugal.", "Abstract": "Herculano S\u00e1 de Figueiredo's sculptures remained anonymous inside the Conde de Ferreira Hospital of Oporto (Portugal) for over 30 years. The accidental discovery of the patient's clinical file enabled the authors of this paper to establish the link between the man, his work and his psychiatric pathology. The artwork kept in the hospital was not previously known in academic and artistic circles. Studying and recovering Figueiredo's work is important because a considerable part of his oeuvre was produced from 1955 to 1973, when he was a patient in the Conde de Ferreira Hospital. The models represented in his sculptures were technicians and patients at the institution."}, {"Title": "Psychiatrists, mental health provision and 'senile dementia' in England, 1940s-1979.", "Abstract": "Until around 1979, 'confused' or mentally unwell people over 65 years of age tended to be labelled as having 'senile dementia'. Senile dementia was usually regarded as a single, inevitably hopeless condition, despite gradually accumulating clinical and pathological evidence to the contrary. Specific psychiatric services for mental illness in older people began to emerge in the 1950s, but by 1969 there were fewer than 10 dedicated services nationally. During the 1970s, 'old age psychiatrists' established local services and campaigned nationally for them. By 1979, about 100 old age psychiatrists were leading multi-disciplinary teams in half the health districts in England. This paper explores the tortuous development of these new services, focusing on provision for people with dementia."}, {"Title": "World citizenship and the emergence of the social psychiatry project of the World Health Organization, 1948-c.1965.", "Abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between 'world citizenship' and the new psychiatric research paradigm established by the World Health Organization in the early post-World War II period. Endorsing the humanitarian ideological concept of 'world citizenship', health professionals called for global rehabilitation initiatives to address the devastation after the war. The charm of world citizenship had not only provided theoretical grounds of international collaborative research into the psychopathology of psychiatric diseases, but also gave birth to the international psychiatric epidemiologic studies conducted by the World Health Organization. Themes explored in this paper include the global awareness of mental rehabilitation, the application of public health methods in psychiatry to improve mental health globally, the attempt by the WHO to conduct large-scale, cross-cultural studies relevant to mental health and the initial problems it faced."}, {"Title": "'At variance with the most elementary principles': the state of British colonial lunatic asylums in 1863.", "Abstract": "In 1863 the Colonial Office reviewed colonial hospitals and lunatic asylums in those parts of the British Empire it administered - probably the first and widest international comparative study up to that date. This article outlines the background, process and scope of the review of asylums, and considers its significance. The resulting 'digest' is an important source to explain how, why, when and by whom metropolitan ideas acquired official endorsement and spread throughout the British world. Using the review's general findings and suggestions, a tool is provided for comparing inter-colonial achievements.

Issues of academic dissertations, lack of access to recent Russian language research in foreign databases, and recent reforms in the Ministry of Education and Science for overcoming these limitations are discussed in detail. Four exemplary dissertation studies published in Russian language are summarized. The first research examines the contribution of patient's verbal behavior to the reliable diagnosis of mild depression, identifying objective signs for distinguishing it from normal sadness; the mood component influenced the whole mental status and was represented in both structure and semantics of patients' speech. The second paper describes the course of panic disorder with agoraphobia, with the notable results that debut of panic disorder with full-blown panic attacks, often declines to a second accompanied with agoraphobia, which after several years gives way to limited symptom attacks and decreased agoraphobic avoidance. The third study describes the high prevalence of affective and anxiety disorders in patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2, and the role of personality traits in adherence to treatment in patients with poor glucose control. The fourth project uses functional MRI for probing the features of neuronal resting-state networks in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy; the association with affective symptoms provides a model for investigating the pathophysiology of mood disorder."}, {"Title": "Putting meaning into medicine: why context matters in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Mainstream psychiatry emphasises controlling symptoms by taking medications. This approach ignores the role of context in shaping illness experiences and how people engage with mental health professionals. The focus on symptom control and medication management also narrows the function of the psychiatrist. This editorial argues that knowledge of patients' lives is important for providing empathic care that is oriented to the outcomes that matter to patients. In addition, care that attends to the person-in-context motivates and sustains mental health providers by putting meaning back into medicine. Truly patient-centred care demands pushing back against the reductionism of contemporary psychiatry to thoughtfully engage with the complexities of patients' lives."}, {"Title": "\"After all the traumas my body has been through, I feel good that it is still working.\"--Basic Body Awareness Therapy for traumatised refugees.", "Abstract": "Basic Body Awareness Therapy (BBAT) is a form of physiotherapy that is often used for psychiatric patients in Scandinavian countries.

Nine persons were included in a male (N=4) and female (N=5) group. All participants were traumatised refugees. The BBAT treatment consisted of 14 sessions over a period of 14 weeks. Before and after treatment the participants were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. The interviews were transcribed and analysed with a thematic approach. The participants also filled out self-administrated questionnaires and two physiotherapists tested the participants' movement harmony using the Body Awareness Rating Scale-Movement Harmony (BARS-MH) test. At the end of the study, the participants filled out anonymous questionnaires about treatment satisfaction.\nThe results showed that the participants had a high compliance, acceptability and treatment satisfaction with BBAT. The majority of participants showed improvements in symptoms from baseline to post-intervention on the self-administrated questionnaires and in the BARS-MH test.\nFurther research is needed to expand the scientific knowledge regarding the use of BBAT in traumatised refugees.

Mental disorders are among those illnesses, which in particular cause suffering to the individual and society.\nTo study burden of disease for mental in comparison to somatic disorders, 2099 patients from 40 general practitioners filled in (a) the Burvill scale which measures acute and chronic illnesses in ten different body systems and (b) the IMET scale which measures impairment in ten different areas of life.\nPatients were suffering on average from acute and/or chronic illness in 3.5 (SD: 2.0) body systems and 56.6% of patients complained about acute and/or chronic mental disorders. The most significant negative impact on the IMET total score have acute and chronic mental disorders, followed by chronic neurological and musculoskeletal and acute respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders, while cardiovascular, metabolic, urogenital, haematological and ear/eye disorders have no greater impact. Acute as well as chronic mental disorders cause impairment across all areas of life and most burden of disease (functional burden of disease 1.69), followed by musculoskeletal disorders (1.62).\nMental disorders are among the most frequent health problems with high negative impact across all areas of life.

This empirical study was undertaken to determine what level of disclosure is optimal to achieve this goal.\nAttendees at five CME programs were randomly assigned to receive either a standard financial disclosure, an intermediate level that included whether speakers received more or less than 5% of their income from each company they disclosed, or a high level of disclosure that included the percent of their income derived from each company. A total of 169 attendees (85.4% response rate) completed a questionnaire regarding the objectivity of the CME presentation they attended.\nAttendees receiving the highest level of disclosure came significantly closer to the ratings of speaker bias made by peer reviewers than did attendees receiving medium or low levels of disclosure (p\u2009=\u20090.03; effect size 0.31). Among the minority of attendees who received the highest level of disclosure but whose assessment of bias differed from that of peer reviewers, however, there was a tendency to underestimate bias (5.9 vs 31.4%; p\u2009<\u20090.0001).\nThe major limitation of this study was an overall low level of bias in the presentations, making it difficult to generalize these findings to less objective programs.

The out-of-hours setting offers specific challenges, and trainees are expected to cope despite being underprepared. We hyphothesised that simulation-based training would increase trainees' competence and confidence in approaching high-risk out-of-hours scenarios.\nA pilot study focused upon the first cohort of psychiatry trainees joining the North East London NHS Foundation Trust in 2012. During their induction (and prior to any clinical duties) each trainee took part in five high-risk clinical scenarios, assessed by a senior psychiatrist and service-user representative. The trainees were required to complete a survey exploring their confidence across nine core psychiatric clinical domains, both before and after the simulation training.\nThe simulation training increased trainee confidence in all nine clinical domains. Before the simulation training, over half of the nine trainees self-rated themselves as having 'no confidence' in six of the nine clinical competencies. After the training, confidence levels had significantly increased, with only two of the competencies scoring any 'no confidence' ratings. There were mixed feelings by trainees on the use of service-user representatives in the training of doctors. Junior doctors have limited experience in psychiatry before starting their training placements\nWe found that high-fidelity simulation training is a useful tool to prepare junior trainees in psychiatry to familiarise themselves with some of the high-risk scenarios that they are likely to encounter during out-of-hour on-call duties. We showed that this intervention increased trainees' confidence across a range of core psychiatric skills.

In Phase I, we performed an initial screening using the Family History Screen (FHS). In Phase II, we identified an \"at-risk\" sample, as well as a randomly selected group of children. A total of 2,512 children (6-12 years old) were assessed using the FHS, the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Data analyses included descriptive and multivariate analytical techniques. 2,512 children (mean age: 8.86 \u00b1 1.84 years; 55.0% male) were categorized into one of the three diagnostic groups: OCD (n = 77), OCS (n = 488), and unaffected controls (n = 1,947). There were no significant socio-demographic differences (age, gender, socioeconomic status) across groups. The OCS group resembled the OCD on overall impairment, including school problems and delinquent behaviors. However, the OCD group did have significantly higher rates of several comorbid psychiatric disorders, including separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, and major depressive disorder, than OCS or unaffected controls. Moreover, the OCD group also scored higher than the SDQ, as well as on each of CBCL items rated by the parent. Our findings suggest that there is a psychopathological continuum between OCS and OCD in school-aged children.

The client's appreciation of his own problem behaviour is not systematically used for these purposes. The current study tests whether using a new client self-appraisal risk assessment instrument, based on the Short Term Assessment of Risk and Treatability (START), improves the assessment of re-offending risk and can support shared decision making in care planning.\nIn a sample of 201 outpatient forensic psychiatric clients, feasibility of client risk assessment, concordance with clinician assessment, and predictive validity of both assessments for violent or criminal behaviour were studied.\nAlmost all clients (98\u00a0%) were able to fill in the instrument. Agreement between client and case manager on the key risk and protective factors of the client was poor (mean kappa for selection as key factor was 0.15 and 0.09, respectively, and mean correlation on scoring -0.18 and 0.20). The optimal prediction model for violent or criminal behaviour consisted of the case manager's structured professional risk estimate for violence in combination with the client's self-appraisal on key risk and protective factors (AUC\u2009=\u20090.70; 95%CI: 0.60-0.80).\nIn outpatient forensic psychiatry, self-assessment of risk by the client is feasible and improves the prediction of re-offending. Clients and their case managers differ in their appraisal of key risk and protective factors. These differences should be addressed in shared care planning. The new Client Self-Appraisal based on START (CSA) risk assessment instrument can be a useful tool to facilitate such shared care planning in forensic psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Reasons for and frequency of off-label drug use.", "Abstract": "The application of drugs in accordance with the marketing authorization issued by the regulatory authority is considered on-label use, while off-label drug use frequently occurs in medical practice. It includes the application of drugs beyond approved indications; for unapproved age group, with different dosage regimens or different administration route. Medical specialists frequently prescribe an off-label drug in pediatrics, neonatology, geriatrics, psychiatry and oncology. Some countries have established registers of off-label drugs and guidelines for their prescribing and administration. The aim of the paper is to review practices in off-label drug use in order to satisfy the attitude of regulatory bodies and professional associations regarding the off-label use of drugs.\nThe sources of information used are articles published in scientific journals and information from the official websites of regulatory agencies.\nThe most common reasons why physicians decide to prescribe off-label drugs are primarily the absence of drugs for a particular indication or those for a particular age group. In their daily work, doctors prescribe drugs for an off-label use based on their own or other colleague's experience. There is no general agreement on off-label use of drugs at the national or international level, but more and more doctors' associations and regulatory bodies approve off-label drug use in compliance with certain scientific and legal requirements.\nOff-label drug use has its place in practice and it has been widely accepted by the medical community and by itself it is not a violation of the standards of healthcare. Off-label use is common in our country and worldwide, and it is necessary to establish a registry for off-label drug use."}, {"Title": "Childhood Traumatic Experiences, Dissociative Symptoms, and Dissociative Disorder Comorbidity Among Patients With Panic Disorder: A Preliminary Study.", "Abstract": "This study assessed childhood trauma history, dissociative symptoms, and dissociative disorder comorbidity in patients with panic disorder (PD). A total of 92 psychotropic drug-naive patients with PD, recruited from outpatient clinics in the psychiatry department of a Turkish hospital, were involved in the study. Participants were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D), Dissociation Questionnaire, Panic and Agoraphobia Scale, Panic Disorder Severity Scale, and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Of the patients with PD, 18 (19%) had a comorbid dissociative disorder diagnosis on screening with the SCID-D. The most prevalent disorders were dissociative disorder not otherwise specified, dissociative amnesia, and depersonalization disorders. Patients with a high degree of dissociation symptoms and dissociative disorder comorbidity had more severe PD than those without (p < .05). All of the childhood trauma subscales used were correlated with the severity of symptoms of dissociation and PD. Among all of the subscales, the strongest relationship was with childhood emotional abuse. Logistic regression analysis showed that emotional abuse and severity of PD were independently associated with dissociative disorder. In our study, a significant proportion of the patients with PD had concurrent diagnoses of dissociative disorder.

Weight suppression was the discrepancy between highest lifetime weight at adult height and weight at pretreatment assessment. Outcome variables were total weight gain, rate of weight gain, and bulimic symptoms in the month prior to post-treatment assessment [assessed using the Eating Disorders Examination (Fairburn et al., Binge-Eating: Nature, Assessment and Treatment. New York: Guilford, 1993)].\nWeight suppression was positively associated with total weight gain and rate of weight gain over treatment. Regression models showed that this association could not be explained by covariates (age at onset of anorexia nervosa and treatment modality). Weight suppression was not significantly associated with bulimic symptoms in the month prior to post-treatment assessment, regardless of whether bulimic symptoms were examined as continuous or dichotomous variables.\nThe present study reinforces the previous finding that weight suppression predicts total weight gain and rate of weight gain amongst patients being treated for anorexia nervosa. Methodological issues may explain the failure of the present study to find that weight suppression predicts bulimic symptoms. Weight suppression at pretreatment for anorexia nervosa should be assessed routinely and may inform treatment planning."}, {"Title": "Explaining pharmacophobia and pharmacophilia in psychiatric patients: relationship with treatment adherence.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study is to assess psychiatric patient attitudes towards psychotropic medication and their association with adherence, as well as to identify the factors that influence these attitudes.\nNine hundred and forty nine consecutive psychiatric outpatients categorized as \"pharmacophobic\" or \"pharmacophilic\" according to the Drug Attitude Inventory were compared with regard to adherence to prescribed treatment, socio-demographic variables, clinical characteristics, health locus of control, self-efficacy, and psychological reactance.\nSeventy three per cent of psychiatric outpatients showed a \"pharmacophilic\" attitude and 15.5% \"pharmacophobic\" one.

Consequently, treatment of these symptoms requires physical activation and pharmacological or physical immobilization should be avoided. The few trials that have been conducted in inpatient dementia care to investigate the effects of exercise on behavioural and psychological symptoms revealed inconsistent results. Due to a lack of evidence, there is a paucity of recommendations for physical activation in this stage of care. Therefore, this trial seeks to investigate the effects of a day-structuring exercise programme on behavioural and psychological symptoms as well as on circadian rhythms of patients with dementia, hospitalized because of their behavioural and psychological disturbances.\nA single-centre randomised controlled trial will be conducted in three special dementia care units of an old age psychiatry hospital. Enrolled patients will receive either a 2-week exercise programme, or a 2-week social stimulation programme in addition to usual care. Due to the provision of four day-structuring exercise-sessions in the course of an intervention day, the exercise programme for the study group is called exercise-carrousel. Baseline and post-intervention assessment for the primary outcome variable - the overall effects on behavioural and psychological symptoms--will be measured by the Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change. The following objectives are set up as secondary outcomes: dimensions of the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and caregiver burden, routine and on-demand psychotropic medication, patients' motor behaviour, diurnal cortisol-levels from saliva probes and brain-derived neurotrophic factor-levels from blood serum.\nIn order to be regarded as an important treatment option for behavioural and psychological symptoms, physical activation in inpatient hospital dementia care requires more evidence and appropriate recommendations. Respecting hospital routines and the intra-daily variability of the patients' motivation and behavioural disturbances in the provision of exercise sessions could lead to higher exercise adherence and better effects on patients' behavioural and psychological symptoms than former trials have presented. The concealment of allocation throughout the trial and the rating of individual exercise exertion present the key challenges and main limitations of this trial.\nDRKS00006740 (German Clinical Trial Register, date of registration: 28 October 2014)."}, {"Title": "Specificity and sensitivity of visual evoked potentials in the diagnosis of schizophrenia: rethinking VEPs.", "Abstract": "Alterations of the visual evoked potential (VEP) component P1 at the occipital region represent the most extended functional references of early visual dysfunctions in schizophrenia (SZ). However, P1 deficits are not reliable enough to be accepted as standard susceptibility markers for use in clinical psychiatry. We have previously reported a novel approach combining a standard checkerboard pattern-reversal stimulus, spectral resolution VEP, source detection techniques and statistical procedures which allowed the correct classification of all patients as SZ compared to controls. Here, we applied the same statistical approach but to a single surface VEP - in contrast to the complex EEG source analyses in our previous report. P1 and N1 amplitude differences among spectral resolution VEPs from a POz-F3 bipolar montage were computed for each component. The resulting F-values were then Z-transformed. Individual comparisons of each component of P1 and N1 showed that in 72% of patients, their individual Z-score deviated from the normal distribution of controls for at least one of the two components. Crossvalidation against the distribution in the SZ-group improved the detection rate to 93%. In all, six patients were misclassified. Clinical validation yielded striking positive (78.13%) and negative (92.69%) predictive values. The here presented procedure offers a potential clinical screening method for increased susceptibility to SZ which should then be followed by high density electrode array and source detection analyses.

We used voxel-based morphometry and a questionnaire to determine individual morningness-eveningness and its association with brain structures in 432 healthy men and 344 healthy women (age, 20.7\u00b11.8years). We demonstrated that morningness (less eveningness) was associated with (a) lower regional gray matter density (rGMD) in the precuneus and adjacent areas, (b) lower rGMD in the left posterior parietal cortex and adjacent areas, and (c) higher rGMD in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex. Further, our exploratory analyses revealed that (d) higher rGMD in hypothalamic areas around the bilateral suprachiasmatic nuclei were associated with morningness. These findings demonstrate that variations in morningness-eveningness reflect the GM structures of focal regions across the cortex, and suggest a structural basis for individual morningness-eveningness and its association with a wide range of psychological variables distributed across different GM areas of the brain."}, {"Title": "In Memoriam: Wayne Katon, MD (1950-2015).", "Abstract": "The following is a memorial of Dr. Wayne J.

Thematic analysis and constant comparison techniques were used for analysis. A problem, needs and practice analysis was also used to structure overall data interpretation.\nThirty three unique exposures to patient violence among the sample of nurses were analysed.

Issues of power, control and stigma also influenced nurse participant perceptions and their responses to patient violence. Nurses used a variety of strategies to maintain their personal safety and to prevent, and manage patient violence. Nurses endorsed the need for improved education, debriefing following an incident, and a supportive work environment to further prevent patient violence. Present findings have implications for reducing the barriers to reporting violent experiences and the creation of best practice guidelines to reduce patient violence in the workplace.\nUnderstanding the perspectives and experiences of nurses in acute inpatient psychiatry leads to greater understanding of the phenomenon of patient violence and may inform the development of interventions to prevent and to respond to patient violence, as well as support nurses working within the acute care setting."}, {"Title": "Limitations of the biopsychosocial model in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "A commitment to an integrative, non-reductionist clinical and theoretical perspective in medicine that honors the importance of all relevant domains of knowledge, not just \"the biological,\" is clearly evident in Engel's original writings on the biopsychosocial model.

It was in Trieste, Italy, in the 1970s that the radical psychiatrist, Franco Basaglia, implemented his vision of anti-institutional, democratic psychiatry. The Trieste model put the suffering person-not his or her disorders-at the center of the health care system. The model, revolutionary in its time, began with the \"negation\" and \"destruction\" of the traditional mental asylum ('manicomio'). A novel community mental health system replaced the mental institution. To achieve this, the Trieste model promoted the social inclusion and full citizenship of users of mental health services. Trieste has been a collaborating center of the WHO for four decades with a goal of disseminating its practices across the world. This paper illustrates a recent attempt to determine whether the Trieste model could be translated to the city of San Francisco, California. This process revealed a number of obstacles to such a translation. Our hope is that a review of Basaglia's ideas, along with a discussion of the obstacles to their implementation, will facilitate efforts to foster the social integration of persons with mental disorders across the world."}, {"Title": "Effects of palatable cafeteria diet on cognitive and noncognitive behaviors and brain neurotrophins' levels in mice.", "Abstract": "The consumption of palatable high-fat and high-sugar foods have increased dramatically over the past years. Overconsumption of calorically dense food contributes to increasing rates of overweight and obesity that are associated with psychiatry disorders, in particular mood and anxiety disorders. This study evaluated the impact of palatable cafeteria diet (CAF) intake on cognitive and noncognitive behaviors, as well as identified factors related to these behaviors through an evaluation of brain neurotrophic factor (BDNF, NGF, and GDNF) levels in hippocampus of mice. Male Swiss mice received two different diets during 13\u00a0weeks: standard chow (STA) and highly CAF. Posteriorly, forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), plus-maze test (PMT), open-field tests (OFT), and object recognition task (ORT) were utilized as behavioral tests. In addition, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and nerve growth factor (NGF) neurotrophins' levels were evaluated in hippocampus of mice. The results demonstrated that mice from the CAF group showed a decrease in the immobility time in the FST and TST. Besides, mice in the CAF group spent more time in the open arms of the PMT. No significant differences were observed in the cognitive behaviors, which were evaluated in the OFT and ORT. In addition, the CAF group showed that BDNF and NGF protein levels increased in the hippocampus of mice.

If disorders emerge they tend to be more severe and less responsive to treatment. We introduce the concept of latent vulnerability as a way of conceptualizing the nature of this psychiatric risk. We argue that vulnerability to mental health problems can be understood as changes in a suite of neurocognitive systems that reflect adaptation or altered calibration to early neglectful or maltreating environments. Altered threat processing is presented as one exemplar candidate system. Heightened neurocognitive vigilance to threat is argued to reflect a calibration to an early at-risk environment that becomes maladaptive (and instantiates vulnerability) in the longer term. Other neurocognitive domains, including reward and memory processing, represent equally promising candidates for indexing latent vulnerability and warrant future enquiry. We suggest that the operationalization of latent vulnerability has the potential to guide a preventative psychiatry approach. Intervention currently occurs at two stages when maltreatment is confirmed: first, by addressing issues of risk; and second, by providing clinical intervention if a child meets criteria for psychiatric disorder. We argue that indexing latent vulnerability represents a third intervention opportunity, with the potential to target an indicated prevention approach for the most vulnerable children, offsetting risk trajectories before psychiatric disorders emerge."}, {"Title": "Brain adaptation and alternative developmental trajectories.", "Abstract": "Resilience and adaptation in the face of early genetic or environmental risk has become a major interest in child psychiatry over recent years.

Diagnostic entities such as subthreshold PTSD are subject to a certain arbitrariness as they are mainly the result of empiricism. This fact stresses the urgent need for neurobiologically-informed psychiatric diagnoses and motivated the here-presented proposal of a symptom-based research concept.

The results of random coefficients modelling indicated that demographic and clinical variables were identified as being significant for HRQoL over time. In addition to lung function, transplant status, age, having a totally implantable vascular access device, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, BMI and B. cepacia complex impacted on many HRQoL domains longitudinally. Gender was important for the domain of body image.\nDemographic and changes in clinical variables were independently associated with a change in HRQoL over time. Compared with these longitudinal data, cross-sectional data are inadequate when evaluating the relationships between HRQoL domains and key demographic and clinical variables, as they fail to recognise the full impact of the CF disease trajectory and its treatments on quality of life."}, {"Title": "Enrich classifications in psychiatry with textual data: an ontology for psychiatry including social concepts.", "Abstract": "We propose a modular approach to develop an ontology of psychiatry, ONTOPSYCHIA, based on Patient Discharges Summaries (PDS) and divided into three modules (i.e. social, mental disorders and treatments).

Previous research has mainly focused on philosophical, conceptual issues or on evaluation of different tools for assessing patients' capacity. The aim of the present study is to investigate how the concept and its normative role are understood in Swedish psychiatric care. Of special interest for present purposes are the relationships between decisional capacity and psychiatric disorders and between health law and practical ethics.\nEight in-depth interviews were conducted with Swedish psychiatrists. The interviews were analysed according to descriptive qualitative content analysis in which categories and sub-categories were distilled from the material.\nDecision-making capacity was seen as dependent on understanding, insight, evaluation, reasoning, and abilities related to making and communicating a choice. However, also the actual content of the decision was held as relevant. There was an ambivalence regarding the relationship between psychiatric disorders and capacity and a tendency to regard psychiatric patients who made unwise treatment decisions as decisionally incapable. However, in cases relating to patients with somatic illnesses, the assumption was rather that patients who made unwise decisions were imprudent but yet decisionally capable.\nThe respondents' conceptions of decision-making capacity were mainly in line with standard theories. However, the idea that capacity also includes aspects relating to the content of the decision clearly deviates from the standard view. The tendency to regard imprudent choices by psychiatric patients as betokening lack of decision-making capacity differs from the view taken of such choices in somatic care. This difference merits further investigations."}, {"Title": "Assisting Undergraduate Physician Assistant Training in Psychiatry: The Role of Academic Psychiatry Departments.", "Abstract": "Physician assistants (PAs) are medical professionals who practice medicine with the supervision of a physician through delegated autonomy. PA school accreditation standards provide limited guidance for training PAs in psychiatry. As a result, PA students may receive inconsistent and possibly inadequate exposure to psychiatry. Providing broad and in-depth exposure to the field of psychiatry is important to attract PA students to pursue careers in psychiatry and provide a possible solution to the shortage of psychiatrists nationwide. Additionally, this level of exposure will prepare PA students who pursue careers in other fields of medicine to recognize and address their patient's psychiatric symptoms in an appropriate manner. This training can be provided by an academic department of psychiatry invested in the education of PA students. We describe a training model implemented at our university that emphasizes psychiatrist involvement in the preclinical year of PA school and full integration of PA students into the medical student psychiatry clerkship during the clinical years. The benefits and challenges to implementing this model are discussed as well."}, {"Title": "Commentary on: \"Satisfaction with information used to choose prostate cancer treatment.\" Gilbert SM, Sanda MG, Dunn RL, Greenfield TK, Hembroff L, Klein E, Saigal CS, Pisters L, Michalski J, Sandler HM, Litwin MS, Wei JT.

Data included Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ). Chi-squared test and t-test were used to compare women with men for variables with parametric distributions, and Mann-Whitney test for non-parametric distribution. Adjustments for potential confounders (age, level of education, ethnicity and comorbidites) were made by logistic regression models (for discrete variables) or analysis of covariance.\nThe female-to-male ratio (i.e., 844 women, 489 men) for any anxiety disorder was 1.73 : 1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.63-1.83), with the strongest skewness for post-traumatic stress disorder (2.80 : 1) and the smallest one for social phobia (1.18 : 1). Compared with men, women reported more severe self-rating scores on the BSI (on average, the scores were 12.3% higher on 3 of 9 subscales: somatisation, interpersonal sensitivity and anxiety), SF-36 (self-reported generic health status was lower on 5 of 8 subscales: physical functioning, social functioning, physical problems, vitality and bodily pain) and MASQ (on average, the scores were 6.6% higher on 4 of 5 subscales: anxious arousal, general distress, general distress depression, general distress anxiety). On the contrary, no gender difference was found in the severity of anxiety symptoms measured by the Brief Anxiety Scale.

The present study aimed to empirically measure the prevalence and distribution of complex co-occurring disorders (CCD) in a large geographic region that includes urban as well as rural and remote settings.\nLinked data were examined in a population of roughly 3.7 million adults. Inclusion criteria for the CCD subpopulation were: physician diagnosed substance use and mental disorders; psychiatric hospitalisation; shelter assistance; and criminal convictions.

Participants had high rates of hospitalisation (8.2 admissions), criminal convictions (8.6 sentences) and social assistance payments (over $36 000 CDN) in the past 5 years. There was wide variability in the geographic distribution of people with CCD, with high prevalence rates in rural and remote settings.\nPeople with CCD are not restricted to areas with large populations or to urban settings.

Meta-analyses addressing the association of the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) gene and ADHD were inconclusive due to excessive heterogeneity across studies. Both the great phenotypic heterogeneity of ADHD and the complexity of the genomic region where DRD2 is located could contribute to the inconsistent findings. Most previous DRD2 studies focused on the well-known Taq1A (rs1800497) SNP, which is actually placed in a neighbor gene (ANKK1). These two genes, together with NCAM1 and TTC12, form the NTAD gene cluster on Chr11q22-23. In order to address the reasons for the high heterogeneity previously reported on DRD2 effects on ADHD, this study investigates the role of NTAD variants on ADHD susceptibility in adults and on the modulation of comorbidity and personality profiles in these patients. Functional polymorphisms from NTAD were analyzed, both individually and in haplotypes, on a sample of 520 adults with ADHD and 630 non-ADHD controls. No direct association of NTAD variants with ADHD susceptibility itself was observed. However, different NTAD polymorphisms and haplotypes were associated to various phenotypes relevant to the clinical heterogeneity of ADHD, including Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Harm Avoidance and Persistence temperament scores. Therefore, these findings represent a possible explanation for the multiple conflicting findings regarding polymorphisms in this genomic region in psychiatry. The NTAD cluster may comprise a variety of independent molecular influences on various brain and behavior characteristics eventually associated with ADHD comorbidities and personality traits. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, {"Title": "A knowledge network for a dynamic taxonomy of psychiatric disease.", "Abstract": "Current taxonomic approaches in medicine and psychiatry are limited in validity and utility.

The nosology of modern psychiatry began with the German classifiers of the late 19th century, especially Emil Kraepelin. Psychoanalysis then blotted out the classificatory vision for the next half-century, and most of this European psychopathological science failed to cross the Atlantic. The DSM series was a homegrown American product, beginning with Medical 203 in 1945, then guided by psychoanalytic insights through DSM-I in 1952 and DSM-II in 1968. In 1980, DSM-III represented a massive \"turning of the page\" in nosology, and it had the effect of steering psychoanalysis toward the exit in psychiatry and the beginning of a reconciliation of psychiatry with the rest of medicine. With the advent of DSM-5, however, questions are starting to be asked about whether this massive venture is on the right track."}, {"Title": "French perspectives on psychiatric classification.", "Abstract": "This article reviews the role of the French schools in the development of psychiatric nosology.

From the 1880s until World War I, German-speaking schools exerted the most influence, featuring the work of major figures such as Emil Kraepelin and Eugen Bleuler. French schools were probably hampered by excessive administrative and cultural centralization. Between the 1880s and the 1930s, French schools developed diagnostic categories that set them apart from international classifications. The main examples are Bouff\u00e9e D\u00e9lirante, and the complex set of chronic delusional psychoses (CDPs), including chronic hallucinatory psychosis. CDPs were distinguished from schizophrenia by the lack of cognitive deterioration during evolution.

Throughout his professional life, Kraepelin put emphasis on establishing psychiatry as a clinical science with a strong empirical background. He preferred pragmatic attitudes and arguments, thus underestimating the philosophical presuppositions of his work. As for nosology, his central hypothesis is the existence and scientific accessibility of \"natural disease entities\" (\"nat\u00fcrliche Krankheitseinheiten\") in psychiatry. Notwithstanding contemporary criticism that he commented upon, this concept stayed at the very center of Kraepelin's thinking, and therefore profoundly shaped his clinical nosology."}, {"Title": "Descriptive psychopathology, phenomenology, and the legacy of Karl Jaspers.", "Abstract": "With his early publications (1910-1913), Karl Jaspers created a comprehensive methodological arsenal for psychiatry, thus laying the foundation for descriptive psychopathology. Following Edmund Husserl, the founder of philosophical phenomenology, Jaspers introduced phenomenology into psychopathology as \"static understanding,\" ie, the unprejudiced intuitive reproduction (Vergegenw\u00e4rtigung) and description of conscious phenomena. In a longitudinal perspective, \"genetic understanding\" based on empathy reveals how mental phenomena arise from mental phenomena. Severance in understanding of, or alienation from, meaningful connections is seen as indicating illness or transition of a natural development into a somatic process. Jaspers opted for philosophy early. After three terms of law, he switched to studying medicine, came to psychopathology after very little training in psychiatry; to psychology without ever studying psychology; and to a chair in philosophy without ever studying philosophy. In the fourth and subsequent editions of his General Psychopathology, imbued by his existential philosophy, Jaspers partly abandoned the descriptive method."}, {"Title": "Why do we need a diagnosis?

The mean time that elapsed from the initial sexual abuse occurrence until the date of examination was 22.7\u00b121.7months. The evaluation of the relationship between this time span and cortisol levels revealed that cortisol levels decreased with increasing time after trauma. Cortisol and BDNF levels were lower in the victims who experienced multiple sexual assaults.\nThe results of the present study suggest that cortisol and BDNF could be biological molecular mediators of the effects of trauma on biological and psychological systems.

As the world seek to generate more data on the mental health of the teeming children and youth population in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), cross-cultural issues need be considered. This consideration is imperative for reasons which include the high level of ethno-diversity in LMICs; the contextual issues in the conceptualization of normal (and abnormal) childhood across cultures, the cross-cultural nuances in risk and protective factors, and the plurality of nature and expression of childhood psychopathology. As much as it is imperative to do so, advancing cross-cultural child and adolescent research in LMICs will need to overcome challenges such as inclusive sampling and cultural validation of instruments developed in the industrialized countries of the West.

Obligations and injunctions of treatment are two different types of COT that differ in terms of proceedings (obligations of treatment require no preliminary forensic psychiatric assessment; as for injunctions of treatment, they require the appointment of a coordinating medical doctor) and that are applied for different offences. However, both are psychiatric commitment procedures connecting the judicial, medical and social fields and their overall numbers have been on the rise.

Better knowledge of such forensic practices is essential to their improvement and even to adjust the legal framework of these measures that are enjoying a boom. The purpose of this literature review is to define the prevalence of COT as well as the sociodemographic, criminal and psychiatric characteristics of those concerned by such measures.\nA review of the French medical literature on COT was carried out using Science Direct up to December 2013.

This was completed with a review of the articles listed in social sciences and law databases (Cairn and Dalloz).\nIt has become increasingly frequent to rely on psychiatric teams to implement COT while at the same time public mental health services have to face a surge in activity with restricted financial means. Obligations of treatment are far more common (about 20,000\u00a0court orders a year) than injunctions of treatment (about 4000\u00a0measures are currently being enforced). However the latter have showed an increase of 506% over the 2000\u00a0decade. Both measures mainly concern men (83-99%) who are rather low on the social scale. In about half of these men, no mental disorder was found, however the prevalence of personality disorders ranged from 22\u00a0to 65% while that of psychotic disorders was low. Injunctions of treatment concerned sex offenders (90% of cases) whereas obligations of treatment concern non-sexual abusers (40-70%) rather than sex offenders (20-30%).\nPsychiatric research on COT is still thin on the ground and its methodology does not allow rigorous evaluation though the use of such measures is growing. When confronted with people who have not sought any care or treatment, healthcare professionals are at a loss. In France, training in forensic psychiatry is inadequate and specialised healthcare (particularly for sex offenders) need improving to reach the level of those found in many other European countries. The purpose of psychiatric treatment differs from that of lawmakers whose aim is to prevent recidivism. However, better treatment consistency requires setting up partnerships between justice, health and social services. To improve connections, there are various avenues of work such as, for instance, the creation of coordinating medical doctors for injunctions of treatment in France or European experiments using a multidisciplinary approach to prevent recidivism in sex offenders. The framework of such a partnership remains to be created as it is part and parcel of COT but has not been provided for in the law. Healthcare jurisdictions as defined in the 2009\u00a0French National Health Law might provide an appropriate framework for mental health and law professionals to collaborate."}, {"Title": "[Hysterical pseudo-coma: A case report].", "Abstract": "Hysterical pseudo-coma corresponds to a state of clinical sleep with contrasting waking electroencephalogram. It can last several hours or even several days in the absence of an underlying organic disease. In psychiatry, this disorder is currently part of the \"dissociative disorder not otherwise specified\". Through this case report, we describe the evolution of a hysterical pseudo-coma that lasted four days in a 28-year-old man. The normality of biological, radiological and electroencephalographic assessments, and responsiveness of the patient during the implementation of a nasogastric tube, led us to suspect a mental origin. An adapted psychiatric care allowed the patient to recover his autonomy after three days of hospitalization. This had prevented the escalation of explorations and invasive treatments. However, the search for organic comorbidity and its management remains a priority."}, {"Title": "Reinforcement learning in depression: A review of computational research.", "Abstract": "Despite being considered primarily a mood disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by cognitive and decision making deficits. Recent research has employed computational models of reinforcement learning (RL) to address these deficits. The computational approach has the advantage in making explicit predictions about learning and behavior, specifying the process parameters of RL, differentiating between model-free and model-based RL, and the computational model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. With these merits there has been an emerging field of computational psychiatry and here we review specific studies that focused on MDD. Considerable evidence suggests that MDD is associated with impaired brain signals of reward prediction error and expected value ('wanting'), decreased reward sensitivity ('liking') and/or learning (be it model-free or model-based), etc., although the causality remains unclear. These parameters may serve as valuable intermediate phenotypes of MDD, linking general clinical symptoms to underlying molecular dysfunctions. We believe future computational research at clinical, systems, and cellular/molecular/genetic levels will propel us toward a better understanding of the disease."}, {"Title": "Parameters of consultee satisfaction with inpatient academic psychiatric consultation services: a multicenter study.", "Abstract": "Consultation-liaison psychiatrists commonly perceive consultee satisfaction as a useful global measure of consultation-liaison service performance. No tool exists to measure consultee satisfaction. A single-site study at Columbia University Medical Center elicited ratings of parameters importantly contributing to consultee satisfaction within consultation-liaison services.\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the generalizability of the rating of importance of these parameters in a larger, multicenter sample.\nFrom October 2013 to January 2014, a confidential and voluntary Web-based survey was distributed to 133 physicians at 7 academic centers in the United States asking them to rate the importance of 16 performance parameters (identified in the previous single-site study) in determining consultee satisfaction.\nOverall, 87 recipients (65%) responded to the survey. Among all the 16 items, there was no significant difference between sites in ratings of item importance. Of the 16 parameters, 9 received a mean rating in the \"important\" to \"very important\" range. Three items, \"completion of consultation within 24 hours of request,\" \"understanding the core questions being asked,\" and \"practical and helpful management suggestions for medical staff\" were rated as the most important. Quickly managing behavioral problems, management suggestions for nursing staff, verbal communication of recommendations, providing diagnostic clarification, facilitating transfer to inpatient psychiatry, and providing follow-up consultation were other parameters that were highly valued by consultees.\nWe found good generalizability across academic medical centers for ratings of parameters important for consultee satisfaction with consultation-liaison services, which can provide the basis for a consultee satisfaction measurement tool."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry in exceptional situations: the crash of flight AH5017 in Mali].", "Abstract": "The practice of the military psychiatrist comprises different perspectives, including a characteristic operational dimension.

One such disorder is excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, also known as dermatillomania, acne excori\u00e9e, neurotic excoriation, or psychogenic excoriation. First identified in the dermatologic literature in 1920, excoriation disorder involves repetitive scratching behavior that sometimes accompanies pruritus and is often associated with depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition, excoriation or skin-picking disorder is listed as a stand-alone disorder associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder. In certain patients, the skin lesions are shallow and have adherent crusts that can be mistaken for acne. These lesions, once healed, may appear white and partially atrophic. Because these patients often initially present to dermatologists or plastic surgeons for their skin conditions rather than to psychiatric professionals, it is important to recognize the salient diagnostic features and to acknowledge the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to patient care and management. We present a case of a 51-year-old woman with excoriation disorder who required medical management by dermatology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, and plastic surgery for a definitive surgical treatment."}, {"Title": "Primary mental health prevention themes in published research and academic programs in Israel.", "Abstract": "The World Health Organization Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan (CMHAP) 2013-2020 proposes the implementation of primary prevention strategies to reduce the mental health burden of disease. The extent to which Israeli academic programs and published research adhere to the principles spelled out by the CMHAP is unknown.\nTo investigate the presence of mental health primary prevention themes in published research and academic programs in Israel.\nWe searched for mental health primary prevention themes in: (1) three major journals of psychiatry and social sciences during the years 2001-2012; (2) university graduate programs in psychology, social work and medicine in leading universities for the academic year of 2011-2012; and (3) doctoral and master's theses approved in psychology and social work departments in five universities between the years 2007-2012. We used a liberal definition of primary prevention to guide the above identification of themes, including those related to theory, methods or research information of direct or indirect application in practice.\nOf the 934 articles published in the three journals, 7.2%, n\u2009=\u200967, addressed primary prevention. Of the 899 courses in the 19 graduate programs 5.2%, n\u2009=\u200947, elective courses addressed primary prevention.

Only 11 (4.7%) articles, 5 (0.6%) courses, and 5 (0.3%) doctoral and master's theses addressed primary prevention directly.\nThe psychiatric reform currently implemented in Israel and WHO CMHAP call for novel policies and course of action in all levels of prevention, including primary prevention. Yet, the latter is rarely a component of mental health education and research activities. The baseline we drew could serve to evaluate future progress in the field."}, {"Title": "Current state and recent developments of child psychiatry in China.", "Abstract": "China has a population of 1.3 billion, of which 238 million are children under age 15. The rapid economic development and social reforms that have taken place in recent years all had a great influence on child and adolescent mental health. Though a nationwide prevalence study for child and adolescent mental disorders in China is lacking, several regional studies have shown the prevalence of mental disorders in children to be close to the worldwide prevalence of 20%. This article reviews the current status of Chinese child psychiatry, the prevalence of specific disorders in China and the influence of culture on the diagnosis and treatment of child and adolescent mental disorders. Several important social issues are also explored in detail, including the one child policy and left-behind children of migrating workers. Changes in family structures along with the growing competitions in life have weakened the traditional social support system. As a result childhood behavioral problems, mood disorders in young college students, substance abuse and youth suicide are all increasing in China. Many who suffer from mental disorders are not adequately cared for because the scarcity of qualified service providers and pathways to care.

Research and other available data on the prevalence of psychiatric problems among children and adolescents in Singapore are summarized, although there has been no nation-wide epidemiological study done. One of the most recent developments has been the establishment of a community mental health service, which works collaboratively with schools and community partners. Some challenges are also discussed especially in the area of child and adolescent psychiatry training. Possible future directions include providing mental heath care for preschool children as well as epidemiological studies to identify disease prevalence and mental health needs among children and adolescents in Singapore."}, {"Title": "Perspective-taking abilities in the balance between autism tendencies and psychosis proneness.", "Abstract": "Difficulties with the ability to appreciate the perspective of others (mentalizing) is central to both autism and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. While the disorders are diagnostically independent, they can co-occur in the same individual. The effect of such co-morbidity is hypothesized to worsen mentalizing abilities. The recent influential 'diametric brain theory', however, suggests that the disorders are etiologically and phenotypically diametrical, predicting opposing effects on one's mentalizing abilities. To test these contrasting hypotheses, we evaluated the effect of psychosis and autism tendencies on the perspective-taking (PT) abilities of 201 neurotypical adults, on the assumption that autism tendencies and psychosis proneness are heritable dimensions of normal variation. We show that while both autism tendencies and psychosis proneness induce PT errors, their interaction reduced these errors. Our study is, to our knowledge, the first to observe that co-occurring autistic and psychotic traits can exert opposing influences on performance, producing a normalizing effect possibly by way of their diametrical effects on socio-cognitive abilities. This advances the notion that some individuals may, to some extent, be buffered against developing either illness or present fewer symptoms owing to a balanced expression of autistic and psychosis liability."}, {"Title": "Electroconvulsive therapy as a treatment for refractory neuropsychiatric lupus with catatonia: three case studies and literature review.", "Abstract": "Neuropsychiatric disorders associated with systemic lupus erythematosus are very common. Treatment generally consists of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive therapy; however, some cases are unresponsive. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a recognized treatment modality in psychiatry and is an option for refractory cases of neuropsychiatric lupus. This report describes three cases of neuropsychiatric lupus that improved with ECT after failure of antipsychotics and immunosuppressive therapy. All cases met DSM-5 criteria for catatonia (case 1: agitation, stereotypies, and grimacing; case 2: stupor, mutism, and grimacing; case 3: agitation, mutism, and stereotypies); therefore, ECT was indicated. This case series shows that ECT can be a therapeutic option in patients with neuropsychiatric lupus, especially when associated with catatonia and unresponsive to conventional treatment."}, {"Title": "Confidentiality principles in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Confidentiality stands out in psychiatry through its multiple connotations as an intrinsic necessity in the ethics of professional relationships. Thus it represents an important characteristic of this profession and at the same time a stringent request which, through its specificity, implies a direct contact with persons in need for help. Despite being inserted in professional codes and legislative systems, confidentiality in psychiatry is far from being considered a clarified matter and does not stand aside from ethical controversy. Keeping the professional secret is often a hard task due to the pressure of the law or of other professional groups who can bring multiple justifications, including that of action for the benefit of society. The therapist is often sub- mitted to a tension caused on the one hand by the promise of keeping the professional secret and on the other hand by multiple requests of breaking the confidentiality. So the problem of confidentiality in Psychiatry deserves special attention because in this profession, more than in other branches of medicine, the gain of the patient's trust is essential in the psychotherapeutic relationship."}, {"Title": "The mental health care bill 2013: a critical appraisal.", "Abstract": "The Mental Health Care Bill - 2013 has been introduced in Rajya Sabha and is now waiting for enactment. The Bill entails unprecedented measures to be undertaken by the Government ensuring everyone right to access mental health care and treatment from services run or funded by the Government. The Government is to meet the man-power requirement of mental health professionals according to international standard within a period of ten years. Various rights of persons with mental illness have been ensured. All the places where psychiatric patients are admitted and treated including the general hospital psychiatry units (GHPU) are to be registered as mental health establishments. Unmodified ECT has been banned and ECT to minors can be given only after approval from the Mental Health Review Board. This article advocates for exemption of GHPU from the purview of the Bill, taking into consideration impediment created in the treatment of vast majority of psychiatric patients who retain their insight into the illness and seldom require involuntary admissions. It is also advocated to reconsider ban on unmodified ECT and restriction placed on ECT to minor which are very effective treatment methods based on scientific evidence. In our country, family is an important asset in management of mental illness. But requirement of seeking approval from the Board in many of the mental health care decision may discourage the families to be proactive in taking care of their wards. The Board and Mental Health Authorities at the central and the state levels are authorized to take many crucial decisions, but these panels have very few experts in the field of mental health."}, {"Title": "Asperger syndrome in India: findings from a case-series with respect to clinical profile and comorbidity.", "Abstract": "Asperger syndrome (AS) is an autism spectrum disorder with a high rate of psychiatric comorbidity.

In this historical article, we present the details of Platter's life and his pioneering work on meningioma.\nIn 1614, Dr. Platter described the first case of meningioma. He described the tumor as a round, fleshy mass shaped like an acorn and as large as a medium-sized apple, and full of holes. The tumor was covered with its own membrane, had no connection with the matters of the brain, and left behind a cavity after removal. This first clear description of an intracranial tumor is most consistent with encapsulated meningioma. The succeeding scholar, Harvey Cushing, coined the term \"meningioma\" for this tumor; neurosurgeons today describe the tumor as \"parasagittal or falcine meningioma.\"\nIn addition to his contribution to meningioma study, Dr. Platter was also the first to describe Dupuytren's disease, hypertrophy of the thalamus, and the retina as the sensory organ of the eye. He contributed to the germ theory of disease and gave substantial accounts of mental illnesses, gynecological disorders, and certain dermatological conditions.\nDr. Platter published numerous accounts on various diseases. In 1614 he reported the case of meningioma in the book entitled \"Platerus Observations in Hominis\". Additionally, Dr. Platter published his work, 'Praxeos Medicae,' which contains his most important contribution on psychiatry and his classification of psychiatric diseases.\nBecause of his many contributions to neuroscience, particularly his identification of meningioma, Dr. Platter should be highly credited as a pioneer in the field of neurosurgery."}, {"Title": "Can findings from randomized controlled trials of social skills training in autism spectrum disorder be generalized? The neglected dimension of external validity.", "Abstract": "Systematic reviews have traditionally focused on internal validity, while external validity often has been overlooked. In this study, we systematically reviewed determinants of external validity in the accumulated randomized controlled trials of social skills group interventions for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. We extracted data clustered into six overarching themes: source population, included population, context, treatment provider, treatment intervention, and outcome. A total of 15 eligible randomized controlled trials were identified. The eligible population was typically limited to high-functioning school-aged children with autism spectrum disorder, and the included population was predominantly male and Caucasian. Scant information about the recruitment of participants was provided, and details about treatment providers and settings were sparse. It was not evident from the trials to what extent acquired social skills were enacted in everyday life and maintained over time. We conclude that the generalizability of the accumulated evidence is unclear and that the determinants of external validity are often inadequately reported. At this point, more effectiveness-oriented randomized controlled trials of equally high internal and external validity are needed. More attention to the determinants of external validity is warranted when this new generation of randomized controlled trials are planned and reported. We provide a tentative checklist for this purpose."}, {"Title": "Case report: low-titre anti-Yo reactivity in a female patient with psychotic syndrome and frontoparieto-cerebellar atrophy.", "Abstract": "Autoimmune and inflammatory mechanisms in psychotic disorders have attracted increasing scientific attention in recent years.

Over the past decade, there has been growing evidence for the use of NAC in treating psychiatric and neurological disorders, considering its role in attenuating pathophysiological processes associated with these disorders, including oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation and glutamate and dopamine dysregulation. In this systematic review we find favorable evidence for the use of NAC in several psychiatric and neurological disorders, particularly autism, Alzheimer's disease, cocaine and cannabis addiction, bipolar disorder, depression, trichotillomania, nail biting, skin picking, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, drug-induced neuropathy and progressive myoclonic epilepsy. Disorders such as anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and mild traumatic brain injury have preliminary evidence and require larger confirmatory studies while current evidence does not support the use of NAC in gambling, methamphetamine and nicotine addictions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Any positive score was associated with age (p<0.033), female gender (p<0.006), and a non-significant trend toward living alone (p<0.095). 8.87% had suicidal thoughts.\nScreening captured the most affectively symptomatic patients, including those with suicidal ideation, for intervention. The partnering of mental health professionals and primary care physicians offers a workable model for addressing the scarcity of expertise in geriatric psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Burden of care on caregivers of schizophrenia patients: a correlation to personality and coping.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a mental disorder where the caregivers are likely to face increasing levels of burden and stress. The present study aims to explore the relation between burden of care on the caregivers of schizophrenic patients with various psychological parameters including their coping strategies, personality type, overall quality of life and socio-demographic details.\nThe participants included in the study (n=110) were administered a socio-demographic data sheet and questionnaires to assess their personality type, burden, quality of life, and coping mechanisms of having a schizophrenic in the family. These questionnaires were administered in individual setting. Their informed consent was taken prior to the administration of tools and their privacy was taken care of. The data obtained was analysed statistically.\nMost of the caregivers were females. The caregivers were observed to have moderate and high levels of burden. Burden on the caregivers showed a significant correlation with psychoticism and their overall quality of life. A significant correlation was seen between the levels of coping and extrovert type of personality, and also with the environmental health of the caregivers. Caregivers belonging to nuclear families coped better than those of joint families.\nThe study concludes that certain personality traits like psychoticism and certain social traits such as living in joint families can increase the risk of caregiver burden in looking after family members suffering from schizophrenia. A need for psychological assistance for the vulnerable caregivers to help them reduce the burden levels and employ positive coping strategies has, therefore, been emphasized in our study."}, {"Title": "The current dialogue between phenomenology and psychiatry: a problematic misunderstanding.", "Abstract": "A revival of the dialogue between phenomenology and psychiatry currently takes place in the best international journals of psychiatry. In this article, we analyse this revival and the role given to phenomenology in this context. Although this dialogue seems at first sight interesting, we show that it is problematic. It leads indeed to use phenomenology in a special way, transforming it into a discipline dealing with empirical facts, so that what is called \"phenomenology\" has finally nothing to do with phenomenology. This so-called phenomenology tallies however with what we have always called semiology. We try to explain the reasons why phenomenology is misused in that way. In our view, this transformation of phenomenology into an empirical and objectifying discipline is explained by the role attributed to phenomenology by contemporary authors, which is to solve the problems raised by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders."}, {"Title": "Young and burnt?

The BOSS online questionnaire, which collected socio-demographic data and five psychometric tools (MBI-GS, AWLS, PHQ-9, SIBQ, BFI), was administered electronically to 180 Italian residents in psychiatry. Simple and multiple linear regressions were performed to analyse data.\n108 questionnaires provided data for the study (response rate: 60%). Mean age: 30.5 \u00b1 3.7 years. Eighty percent of the sample were female. A moderate level of BS emerged, related to work conditions, absence of major depression, satisfaction with pay or less academic activity. Only 0.9% (N=1) of the sample showed PHQ-9 scores suggestive of major depression, while lifetime suicidal ideation was admitted by 16% of residents. For the three dimensions of the MBI-GS, Italian sample scores were consistent with previously published results concerning pooled data in a French-Croatian sample, reporting moderate levels of BS. Higher workload, symptoms of depression and lower satisfaction predicted higher levels of Emotional Exhaustion and Cynicism.\nItalian residents in psychiatry showed overall moderate levels of BS, related to workload and work organization. Other alerts of psychic distress were found among participants, namely symptoms of depression, suicidal ideation and use of psychotropic medications."}, {"Title": "Facial emotion recognition in childhood-onset bipolar I disorder: an evaluation of developmental differences between youths and adults.", "Abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe mental illness with high healthcare costs and poor outcomes. Increasing numbers of youths are diagnosed with BD, and many adults with BD report that their symptoms started in childhood, suggesting that BD can be a developmental disorder. Studies advancing our understanding of BD have shown alterations in facial emotion recognition both in children and adults with BD compared to healthy comparison (HC) participants, but none have evaluated the development of these deficits. To address this, we examined the effect of age on facial emotion recognition in a sample that included children and adults with confirmed childhood-onset type-I BD, with the adults having been diagnosed and followed since childhood by the Course and Outcome in Bipolar Youth study.\nUsing the Diagnostic Analysis of Non-Verbal Accuracy, we compared facial emotion recognition errors among participants with BD (n\u00a0=\u00a066; ages 7-26\u00a0years) and HC participants (n\u00a0=\u00a087; ages 7-25\u00a0years). Complementary analyses investigated errors for child and adult faces.\nA significant diagnosis-by-age interaction indicated that younger BD participants performed worse than expected relative to HC participants their own age. The deficits occurred both for child and adult faces and were particularly strong for angry child faces, which were most often mistaken as sad. Our results were not influenced by medications, comorbidities/substance use, or mood state/global functioning.\nYounger individuals with BD are worse than their peers at this important social skill. This deficit may be an important developmentally salient treatment target - that is, for cognitive remediation to improve BD youths' emotion recognition abilities."}, {"Title": "[Hyperkinetic disorders in childhood and adolescence- an analysis of KinderAGATE 2009-2012].", "Abstract": "This contribution evaluates the prevalence, medication use as well as age and sex distribution in inpatients with hyperkinetic disorders at the KinderAGATE hospitals for 2009-2012.\nThe age, sex, leading diagnosis, prescribed medication, and dosage of each patient were recorded anonymously twice a year. They provide an outstanding epidemiological basis for the observation of the actual situation in child and adolescent psychiatry.\nCompared to our patient collective, patients diagnosed with hyperkinetic disorders (25.5% Pat) were on average 2 years younger and received psychopharmacological treatment more often (statistically significant). Although male patients are dominant here (84.3% HPat, mean age 9.9 years vs. 15.7% HPat, 10.1 years), the same proportion of female and male patients received psychostimulant treatment (48.0% vs. 52.2%). Besides methylphenidate, amphetamine, and atomoxetine, the antipsychotics risperidone, pipamperone, and quetiapine were noticeably often prescribed.\nMethylphenidate remains the drug of first choice in the treatment of ADHD. There is an upward trend in the proportion of patients being treated with antipsychotics, though this is not statistically significant. Because of the discrepancy between the available evidence and prescription practice in child and adolescent psychiatry, there is still a great demand for studies regarding long-term efficacy and side effects."}, {"Title": "Fluoxymesterone-induced gynaecomastia in a patient with childhood aplastic anaemia.", "Abstract": "Gynaecomastia is a benign condition characterised by enlargement of the male breast. Drug-induced gynaecomastia merits deep consideration as it may account for as many as 25% of all cases of gynaecomastia in adults. Although the mechanism is not fully clear, some mechanisms include oestrogen-like activities, stimulation of testicular production of oestrogens, inhibition of testosterone synthesis or blockade of androgen action. Anabolic steroids, in particular when used during the pubertal stage, may cause significant irreversible gynaecomastia. We report a case of 28-year-old Filipino man with persistent gynaecomastia from fluoxymesterone used for aplastic anaemia during his prepubertal stage. Hormonal work ups for gynaecomastia all turned out normal, thus isolating the drug as the cause. The patient was unable to undergo breast reconstruction surgery due to haematological contraindications, but eventually referred to psychiatry for counselling. This case will highlight the paradoxical effect of androgenic steroid used during childhood on male breast proliferation during puberty."}, {"Title": "Hispano-Americans in Europe: what do we know about their health status and determinants? A scoping review.", "Abstract": "Policy makers and health practitioners are in need of guidance to respond to the growing geographic mobility of Hispano-American migrants in Europe. Drawing from contributions from epidemiology, social sciences, demography, psychology, psychiatry and economy, this scoping review provides an up-to-date and comprehensive synthesis of studies addressing the health status and determinants of this population. We describe major research gaps and suggest specific avenues of further inquiry.\nWe identified systematically papers that addressed the concepts \"health\" and \"Hispano Americans\" indexed in five data bases from Jan 1990 to May 2014 with no language restrictions. We screened the 4,464 citations retrieved against exclusion criteria and classified 193 selected references in 12 thematic folders with the aid of the reference management software ENDNOTE X6. After reviewing the full text of all papers we extracted relevant data systematically into a table template to facilitate the synthesising process.\nMost studies focused on a particular disease, leaving unexplored the interlinkages between different health conditions and how these relate to legislative, health services, environmental, occupational, and other health determinants. We elucidated some consistent results but there were many heterogeneous findings and several popular beliefs were not fully supported by empirical evidence. Few studies adopted a trans-national perspective and many consisted of cross-sectional descriptions that considered \"Hispano-Americans\" as a homogeneous category, limiting our analysis. Our results are also constrained by the availability and varying quality of studies reviewed.\nBurgeoning research has produced some consistent findings but there are huge gaps in knowledge. To prevent unhelpful generalisations we need a more holistic and nuanced understanding of how mobility, ethnicity, income, gender, legislative status, employment status, working conditions, neighbourhood characteristics and social status intersect with demographic variables and policy contexts to influence the health of the diverse Hispano-American populations present in Europe."}, {"Title": "[The contributions by Emil Kraepelin to the knowledge on sleep disorders and their treatment].", "Abstract": "While Emil Kraepelin's comprehensive psychiatric oeuvre has attracted researchers' attention, his studies on sleep disorders and their treatment as well as on the interconnections between sleep and mental disorders so far seem to have been neglected.This article identifies and analyzes Kraepelin's sporadic contributions on the pathology of sleep, the comorbidities and treatment made between 1883 and 1924 in textbooks and isolated papers as well as in a presentation that was also published and compares them with current opinions in sleep research.Kraepelin never published a dedicated work on sleep, apart from a summary of the different narcotics; however, his occasional statements reveal astonishing insights and in particular his clear etiologically oriented classification of sleep disorders is captivating. Similar to the current classification, Kraepelin conceptualized sleep disorders as symptoms or rather a complex of symptoms and also identified associated diseases which once again are very near to current opinion. Apart from this his recommendations on sleep hygiene and, in a second step, pharmacological treatment of pathological sleep patterns are still clinically relevant. As early as the end of the nineteenth century Kraepelin laid down an algorithm of treatment which is very similar to the current clinical guidelines. At Kraepelin's time it seemed impossible to reach an agreement on classification and treatment issues of sleep disturbances and even though there has been an ongoing discussion until the present day, an agreement at least about guidelines could be reached. Against this background Kraepelin's contributions can still be regarded as a proposal for best practice."}, {"Title": "Analysis on evolution and research focus in psychiatry field.", "Abstract": "With the dramatic rise in mental disorders and mental illnesses, psychiatry has become one of the fastest growing clinical medical disciplines.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes associated with increased risk for both disorders. Single SNP analyses alone do not address the overall genomic or polygenic architecture of psychiatric disorders as the amount of phenotypic variation explained by each GWAS-supported SNP is small whereas the number of SNPs/regions underlying risk for illness is thought to be very large. The polygenic risk score models the aggregate effect of alleles associated with disease status present in each individual and allows us to utilise the power of large GWAS to be applied robustly in small samples. Here we make the case that risk prediction, intervention and personalised medicine can only benefit with the inclusion of polygenic risk scores in imaging genetics research."}, {"Title": "Genome-wide association study identifies common variants associated with pharmacokinetics of psychotropic drugs.", "Abstract": "Individual variation in pharmacokinetics of psychotropic drugs, particularly metabolism, is an important factor to consider in pharmacological treatment in psychiatry. A large proportion of this variance is still not accounted for, but evidence so far suggests the involvement of genetic factors. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with concentration dose ratio (CDR) as sub-phenotype to assess metabolism rate of psychotropic drugs in a homogenous Norwegian sample of 1334 individuals diagnosed with a severe mental disorder. The GWAS revealed one genome-wide significant marker (rs16935279, p-value=3.95\u00d710(-10), pperm=7.5\u00d710(-4)) located in an intronic region of the lncRNA LOC100505718. Carriers of the minor allele have a lower metabolism rate of antiepileptic drugs compared to major allele carriers. In addition, several nominally significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CDR for antipsychotic, antidepressant and antiepileptic drugs were disclosed. We consider standardised CDR to be a useful measure of the metabolism rate of a drug. The present findings indicate that common gene variants could affect the metabolism of psychotropic drugs. This warrants further investigations into the functional mechanisms involved as it may lead to identification of predictive markers as well as novel drug targets."}, {"Title": "Multidisciplinary, Nurse-Led Psychiatric Consultation in Nursing Homes: A Pilot Study in Clinical Practice.", "Abstract": "To determine the effects of multidisciplinary, nurse-led psychiatric consultation on behavioral problems of nursing home residents.

Eleven of the 42 patients screened with CHAT, were found to be at risk of an ASD outcome. ADOS was performed in 44 and 10 were diagnosed with ASD. The CHAT proved to correlate highly with the ADOS (80% ppv). Only patients with symptomatic IS developed ASD (p = 0.003).

Mutations in dystrophin (DMD) gene are also recognized as a cause of cognitive impairment. We aimed to determine the association between intelligence level and mutation location in DMD genes in Serbian patients with DMD. Forty-one male patients with DMD, aged 3 to 16 years, were recruited at the Clinic for Neurology and Psychiatry for Children and Youth in Belgrade, Serbia. All patients had defined DMD gene deletions or duplications [multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR)] and cognitive status assessment (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Brunet-Lezine scale, Vineland-Doll scale). In 37 patients with an estimated full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ), six (16.22%) had borderline intelligence (70<FSIQ \u226485), while seven (18.92%) were intellectually impaired (FSIQ <70). The FSIQ was not associated with proximal and distal mutations when boundaries were set at exons 30 and 45. However, FSIQ was statistically significantly associated with mutation location when we assumed their functional consequence on dystrophin isoforms and when mutations in the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) of Dp140 (exons 45-50) were assigned to affect only Dp427 and Dp260. Mutations affecting Dp140 and Dp71/Dp40 have been associated with more frequent and more severe cognitive impairment. Finally, the same classification of mutations explained the greater proportion of FSIQ variability associated with cumulative loss of dystrophin isoforms. In conclusion, cumulative loss of dystrophin isoforms increases the risk of intellectual impairment in DMD and characterizing the genotype can define necessity of early cognitive interventions in DMD patients."}, {"Title": "Stigma and discrimination related to mental illness in low- and middle-income countries.", "Abstract": "This paper aims to provide an overview of evidence from low- and middle-income countries (LAMICs) worldwide to address: the nature of stigma and discrimination, relevant context-specific factors, global patterns of these phenomena and their measurement and quantitative and qualitative evidence of interventions intended to reduce their occurrence and impact.

The variables analyzed included the following: patient demographic characteristics; dates of admission, psychiatric consultation, and discharge; psychiatric diagnoses based on the psychiatric diagnostic evaluation; psychiatric treatment disposition; and illness severity and total charges associated with the medical stay.\nEarlier psychiatry consultation was associated with shorter length of stay and lower hospitalization charges after adjusting for psychiatric functioning, physical illness severity, and psychiatric disposition. Poorer psychiatric functioning and milder physical illness were associated with shorter referral time.\nTimely involvement of psychiatry consultation services during a medical or surgical hospitalization was associated with reductions in length of stay and total hospital charges in pediatric settings. These findings have important effects on quality of care via decreasing burden on the patient and family and on the medical system resources. Educating pediatric health care providers about the importance of early psychiatry consultation regardless of physical illness severity or psychiatric acuity will likely improve resource management for patients and hospitals."}, {"Title": "Diagnostic neglect: the potential impact of losing a separate axis for personality disorder.", "Abstract": "Both major classifications in psychiatry have now moved away from the multi-axial nosological model. This is clinically understandable as the specific categorical diagnoses, other than borderline personality disorder and personality disorder 'NOS' (not otherwise specified) were so seldom used and empirical evidence would not support the polythetic categorical system. As a consequence, those with personality disorders, frequently referred to as Axis II disorders, now have to compete with all other mental disorders for clinical attention."}, {"Title": "What Is the Efficacy of Teaching Psychotherapy to Psychiatry Residents and Medical Students?", "Abstract": "Because there are no formal reviews, the authors set out to identify and evaluate studies on teaching psychotherapy to psychiatry residents and medical students.\nPubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched for papers with outcomes on teaching psychotherapy. Search terms included psychotherapy, teaching, residents, medical students, supportive, psychodynamic, cognitive, behavioral, learning, training, skills, competency, and mentalization.\nNine studies were found that met inclusion criteria. There were seven studies of psychiatry residents and two of medical students. Only two of the research designs had comparison groups, and these were both randomized controlled trials, while seven of the other designs were pretest and posttest. Teaching methods, course content, and outcome measures varied widely across studies. Common methodological problems included a lack of control, low numbers of subjects as learners, and a lack of validity of the outcome measures. Only one of the studies was judged to be methodologically rigorous.\nThese findings establish a priority for undertaking additional rigorously designed studies in evaluating the teaching of psychotherapy to psychiatry residents and medical students."}, {"Title": "Finding Time for Fiction.", "Abstract": "With growing advances in psychiatric care come growing amounts of knowledge to be read by psychiatry trainees.

Studies on the qualities of \"good\" psychiatrists have been completed in many countries. However, no such study has been undertaken in Korea. In Korea, recent growing interest in psychiatry demands the identification of qualities for a good psychiatrist. The purpose of this study was to define the qualities of a good psychiatrist in Korea, subsequently facilitating the improvement of psychiatric training programs. The questionnaire was based on a Singaporean survey with the permission from the original authors. Respondents were divided into patient group and psychiatrist group. The 40-item questionnaire contained items grouped into four themes: Professional, Personal Values, Academic Executive and Relationship. Of the four themes, both patient and psychiatrist groups considered Professional as the most important, whereas Academic Executive as the least important. The mean scores for all items of each theme in the patient group were higher than those in the psychiatrist group, reflecting higher expectations for good psychiatrist in the patient group. Patients emphasized Relationship more than psychiatrists did. It is concluded that a good psychiatrist in Korea can be defined as \"a good communicator and listener with a professional manner, who respects confidentiality and has good doctor-patient relationships.\""}, {"Title": "Language Barriers and Access to Psychiatric Care: A Systematic Review.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to synthesize the available evidence regarding the impact of patients' language proficiency on access to psychiatric care.\nA systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO was performed to identify studies published between January 1950 and July 2014 that examined the impact of language proficiency on access to and utilization of psychiatric services in the general population or among patients with psychiatric disorders. The keywords were psychiatry, language, utilization, access, and mental health care. Only articles in English were included. Cross-referencing of the identified articles was also performed.\nEighteen articles from four countries were identified, including 13 from the United States, two from Australia, two from Canada, and one from the Netherlands. These reports were generally consistent in showing a clear association between insufficient language proficiency and underutilization of psychiatric services; 15 studies reported that limited language proficiency was significantly associated with less frequent mental health care visits. Only one article showed an inverse relationship between limited language proficiency and use of mental health services, and two articles reported no association. No published data were found on the effects of linguistic interventions on access to mental health care among people with limited language proficiency.\nIt is plausible that limited language proficiency is closely associated with underutilization of psychiatric services. Still, the lack of prospective interventional data clearly highlights the need for further investigations of the impact of language barriers on access to psychiatric care."}, {"Title": "Discovery of serum biomarkers predicting development of a subsequent depressive episode in social anxiety disorder.", "Abstract": "Although social anxiety disorder (SAD) is strongly associated with the subsequent development of a depressive disorder (major depressive disorder or dysthymia), no underlying biological risk factors are known. We aimed to identify biomarkers which predict depressive episodes in SAD patients over a 2-year follow-up period. One hundred sixty-five multiplexed immunoassay analytes were investigated in blood serum of 143 SAD patients without co-morbid depressive disorders, recruited within the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Predictive performance of identified biomarkers, clinical variables and self-report inventories was assessed using receiver operating characteristics curves (ROC) and represented by the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Stepwise logistic regression resulted in the selection of four serum analytes (AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, vitronectin, collagen IV) and four additional variables (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Beck Anxiety Inventory somatic subscale, depressive disorder lifetime diagnosis, BMI) as optimal set of patient parameters. When combined, an AUC of 0.86 was achieved for the identification of SAD individuals who later developed a depressive disorder. Throughout our analyses, biomarkers yielded superior discriminative performance compared to clinical variables and self-report inventories alone. We report the discovery of a serum marker panel with good predictive performance to identify SAD individuals prone to develop subsequent depressive episodes in a naturalistic cohort design. Furthermore, we emphasise the importance to combine biological markers, clinical variables and self-report inventories for disease course predictions in psychiatry. Following replication in independent cohorts, validated biomarkers could help to identify SAD patients at risk of developing a depressive disorder, thus facilitating early intervention."}, {"Title": "Reducing non-attendance rates in community psychiatry: a case for sustainable development?", "Abstract": "Non-attendance at mental health clinics is an international problem. A survey was conducted in the UK investigating communication methods used by staff to inform and remind patients about appointments. Increased number of communication methods used was associated with a reduced non-attendance rate. A care modelling analysis is provided that explores the healthcare use of three hypothetical patients following clinic non-attendance. The financial and environmental costs of each are then calculated and results discussed. Reducing non-attendance is achievable through the use of multiple communication methods. This small change can improve the sustainability of mental healthcare in different countries by improving quality of care and reducing financial and environmental costs."}, {"Title": "New technologies in the management of risk and violence in forensic settings.", "Abstract": "Novel technological interventions are increasingly used in mental health settings. In this article, we describe 3 novel technological strategies in use for management of risk and violence in 2 forensic psychiatry settings in the United Kingdom: electronic monitoring by GPS-based tracking devices of patients on leave from a medium secure service in London, and closed circuit television (CCTV) monitoring and motion sensor technology at Broadmoor high secure hospital. A common theme is the use of these technologies to improve the completeness and accuracy of data used by clinicians to make clinical decisions. Another common thread is that each of these strategies supports and improves current clinical approaches rather than drastically changing them. The technologies offer a broad range of benefits. These include less restrictive options for patients, improved accountability of both staff and patients, less invasive testing, improved automated record-keeping, and better assurance reporting. Services utilizing technologies need also be aware of limitations. Technologies may be seen as unduly restrictive by patients and advocates, and technical issues may reduce effectiveness. It is vital that the types of technological innovations described in this article should be subject to thorough evaluation that addresses cost effectiveness, qualitative analysis of patients' attitudes, safety, and ethical considerations."}, {"Title": "OCD?

Not Me! is a novel, web-based, self-guided intervention designed to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in young people aged 12-18, using the principles of exposure and response prevention. The current paper presents the protocol for the development of the programme and for an open trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of this programme for OCD in young people, and associated distress and symptom accommodation in their parents and caregivers.\nWe will measure the impact of the OCD? Not Me! programme on OCD symptoms using the Children's Florida Obsessive Compulsive Inventory (C-FOCI), and both the self-report and parent report of the Children's Obsessional Compulsive Inventory-Revised (ChOCI-R). The impact of the programme on OCD-related functional impairment will be measured using the parent report of the Child Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale-Revised (COIS-R). Secondary outcome measures include the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Youth Quality of Life-Short Form (YQoL-SF). The 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) will be used to measure the impact of the programme on parent/caregiver distress, while the Family Accommodation Scale (FAS) will be used to measure change in family accommodation of OCD symptoms.

We will present psychopathological features, diagnostic criteria, genetic and physiopathological hypotheses, as well as therapeutic and prognostic characteristics.\nTwo searches were performed in the Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge (http://wokinfo.com/): 1 - search terms: \"panic disorder\" AND (\"respiratory symptom\" OR \"respiratory symptoms\" OR \"respiratory subtype\" OR \"respiratory panic\" OR \"cardiorespiratory\"); 2 - all articles citing Briggs and colleagues' 1993 article \"Subtyping of Panic Disorder by Symptom Profile\" (Br J Psychiatry 1993;163: 201-9). Only those articles involving human subjects and written English were included.\nIn comparison with patients of the non-respiratory subtype (NRS), RS patients showed greater familial history of PD, and higher comorbidity rates for anxiety disorders and depressive disorders. These patients were also more sensitive to CO2, hyperventilation and caffeine.\nCertain characteristics, such as heightened sensitivity to CO2 and the higher incidence of a family history of PD, clearly distinguished the Respiratory Subtype patients from the Non-Respiratory. Nonetheless, some studies failed to demonstrate differential responses to pharmacological treatment and CBT across the subtypes. RS patients seem to respond faster than NRS to pharmacological treatment with antidepressants and benzodiazepines, but more studies are needed to confirm this finding."}, {"Title": "Castration Depression: Affect, Signal Affect, and/or Depressive Illness?", "Abstract": "The value of Charles Brenner's ideas regarding depression is assessed, focusing on the significance of castration depressive affect.

We aimed to identify the diagnostic spectrum causing a late onset frontal lobe syndrome and examine the quality of commonly used instruments to distinguish between bvFTD and non-bvFTD patients, within this syndrome.\nA total of 137 patients fulfilling the criteria of late onset frontal lobe syndrome, aged 45 to 75 years, were included in a prospective observational study. Diagnoses were made after clinical and neuropsychological examination, and neuroimaging and cerebral spinal fluid results were taken into account. Baseline characteristics and the scores on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), frontal assessment battery (FAB), Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI), and Stereotypy Rating Inventory (SRI) were compared between the bvFTD and the non-bvFTD group.\nFifty-five (40%) of the patients received a bvFTD diagnosis (33% probable and 7% possible bvFTD). Fifty-one patients (37%) had a psychiatric disorder, including 20 with major depressive disorder. Thirty-one patients received an alternative neurological, including neurodegenerative, diagnosis. MMSE and FAB scores were unspecific for a particular diagnosis. A score above 12 on the positive FBI subscale or a score above 5 on the SRI were indicative of a bvFTD diagnosis.\nA broad spectrum of both neurological and psychiatric disorders underlies late onset frontal lobe syndrome, of which bvFTD was the most prevalent diagnosis in our cohort. The commonly used MMSE and the FAB could not successfully distinguish between bvFTD and non-bvFTD, but this could be achieved with the more specific FBI and SRI."}, {"Title": "Safety and Tolerability of Lisdexamfetamine: A Retrospective Cohort Study.", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurobehavioural disorder in children.

Likely because of his specific COMT polymorphism and intermediate metabolizing liver enzymes, when the patient's stimulant medications were titrated to affect for attentional needs, he became psychotic secondary to a hyperdopaminergic state. Past prescriptions of dopaminergic antidepressant agents (e.g., bupropion) likely would have exacerbated further the problem. The patient's serotonin transporter polymorphism also potentially was associated with SSRI inefficacy and increased side effects.

SJS is defined as having a widespread distribution throughout the whole body surface area with <10% extent of skin detachment and skin lesions. Some drugs, such as carbamazepine, have been reported to have a greater correlation to SJS. Although clozapine use has been mentioned as a risk factor for development of SJS, no report has clearly described the features of SJS as a reaction to clozapine use. Herein, we report the case of a patient presenting SJS after long-term clozapine treatment.\nMr A was a 54-year-old male with a diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia. He was hospitalized in a mental institute and received clozapine 200 mg/day for 2 years, without discomfort or drug side effects. He developed acute-onset mouth edema, multiple oral and ocular ulcers, oral and ocular mucosa swelling, and multiple erythematous skin rashes over his entire body and extremities with hypertension and high fever. SJS was diagnosed after referral to a general hospital.\nThe SJS subsided under supportive treatment.\nAccumulated lymphocytes and macrophages in the epidermis and elevated TNF-\u03b1 might cause an immune reaction and apoptosis and result in the clinical presentation of SJS. Clozapine is believed to modulate the immunologic reaction, and therefore might induce SJS through immunomodulation. This case highlights the importance of considering the possibility of SJS resulting from the use of drugs for which there are no reports of such a severe complication."}, {"Title": "5-HT1A Receptor-Mediated Autoinhibition and the Control of Serotonergic Cell Firing.", "Abstract": "The idea that serotonergic synaptic transmission plays an essential role in the control of mood and the pharmacotherapy of anxiety and depression is one of the cornerstones of modern biological psychiatry. As a result, there is intense interest in understanding the mechanisms controlling the activity of serotonin-synthesizing (serotonergic) neurons. One of the oldest and most durable ideas emerging from this work is that serotonergic neurons are capable of autonomously regulating their own basal firing rate. Serotonergic neurons express on their surface 5-HT1A receptors (autoreceptors) that, when activated, induce the opening of potassium channels that hyperpolarize and thereby inhibit cell firing. Activity-dependent release of serotonin within serotonergic nuclei is thought to activate these autoreceptors, thus completing an autoinhibitory feedback loop. This concept, which was originally proposed in the 1970s, has proven to be enormously fruitful and has guided the interpretation of a broad range of clinical and preclinical work. Yet, remarkably, electrophysiological studies seeking to directly demonstrate this phenomenon, especially in in vitro brain slices, have produced mixed results. Here, we critically review this work with a focus on electrophysiological studies, which directly assess neuronal activity. We also highlight recent work suggesting that 5-HT1A receptor-mediated autoinhibition may play other roles in the control of firing besides acting as a feedback regulator for the pacemaker-like firing rate of serotonergic neurons."}, {"Title": "The Relationship between Cognitive Decline and Psychopathology in Patients with Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder.", "Abstract": "The primary goals of the present study were to assess intellectual function in participants with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (BD) and to investigate the relationships between cognitive decline and the severity of each type of psychopathology.\nThe present study included 51 patients with schizophrenia and 42 with BD who were recruited from the psychiatry outpatient clinic of Jeju University Hospital between March 2011 and March 2014. The Korean Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (K-WAIS) was administered to each of the 93 participants, and they were categorized into two groups based on their current intelligence quotient (IQ) and their estimated premorbid IQ: severely impaired group (SIG) and mildly impaired group (MIG).

In this paper, we aim to reveal an even earlier presentation of the malady we now call OCD based on the 9th century work, Sustenance of the Body and Soul, written by Abu Zayd al-Balkhi during the Islamic Golden Era. Discovery of this manuscript reveals that Abu Zayd al-Balkhi should be credited with differentiating OCD from other forms of mental illnesses nearly a millennium earlier than is currently claimed by anthologies documenting the history of mental illness. Particular attention is paid to al-Balkhi's classifications, symptom descriptions, predisposing factors, and the treatment modalities for obsessional disorders.

Consequently, related international literature is sparse, especially concerning the evolution of offenders, and most studies concern small samples or anecdotal cases. We wished to identify the main characteristics of parricidal subjects and their victims, and to assess the socioclinical evolution of the offenders after the assault. To this end, we first studied the sociodemographic, clinical and forensic characteristics of all parricidal patients admitted to France's Henri Colin secure unit between 1996 and 2010 (40 patients). We also assessed the evolution of the 36 patients who had left the secure unit, using questionnaires sent to the psychiatric hospitals where the patients were transferred. We found most offenders to be men (97.5%), with a mean age of 28 years, who were mostly single, unemployed, living with the victim prior to the assault (77.5%), and with a history of psychiatric disorder (72.5%). The population of offenders also displayed an overrepresentation of schizophrenia (87.5%), significant toxic exposure and criminal or violent history. Some patients had attempted suicide before or right after the offense. The assault was mostly committed in the parent's house with an edged weapon, and was characterized by brutality and lack of premeditation. Precipitating factors included substance use and cessation of psychotropic medication. Matricide was more frequent than patricide. At the time of this study, half of the parricidal patients were working or attending therapeutic activities, and most were actively keeping in contact with their family, living as compliant outpatients with no signs of violent behavior. The results of our study on 40 parricidal patients are consistent with data in the literature. With regard to sample evolution, family and community reintegration was relatively effective considering the seriousness of the offense.

Analyses also examined potential classes based on resulting subfactors, gender differences, longitudinal associations with later behavioral problems, and concurrent personality associations.\nBurke's (2010) two-factor model composed of Irritability and Oppositionality subfactors best fit the data. Irritability and Oppositionality showed convergent and divergent patterns of association with personality traits at T1 and with externalizing and internalizing problems at T2. Latent class analyses revealed three classes (low severity, irritable/combined, and oppositional) which showed parallel divergence in externalizing and internalizing problem comorbidity. These findings were largely robust across gender and samples.\nThese findings support Irritability/Oppositionality subfactors of ODD in two mixed-gender samples, demonstrate strong evidence for a lack of gender differences in such subfactors, and demonstrate their convergent and divergent validity in emergent latent classes, later behavioral problems, and personality correlates."}, {"Title": "Advancing the screening of fibromyalgia in late-life depression: practical implications for psychiatric settings.", "Abstract": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is common in older adults suffering from mood disorders. However, clinical diagnosis of FM is challenging, particularly in psychiatric settings. We examined the prevalence of FM and the sensitivity of three simple screeners for FM.\nUsing cross-sectional data, we evaluated three tests against the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 Criteria for the Classification of FM: a \"Do you often feel like you hurt all over?\" question, a pain map score, and the Pope and Hudson (PH) interview for FM. Participants were 185 community-dwelling adults \u2265 60 years old with comorbid depression and chronic low back pain evaluated at a late-life mental health clinic.\nFifty three of 185 participants (29%) met the ACR 1990 FM criteria. Compared to those without FM, the FM group had more \"yes\" answers to the \"hurt all over?\" question and higher pain map scores. To reach a sensitivity of at least 0.90, the cut-off score for the pain map was 8. The sensitivity of the pain map, \"hurt all over?\" question, and PH criteria were 0.92 [95%CI 0.82-0.98], 0.91 [95%CI 0.79-0.97], and 0.94 [95%CI 0.843-0.99] respectively.\nNearly one in three older adults suffering from depression and chronic low back pain met ACR 1990 FM criteria.

This analysis aimed to study the cost and burden of neuropsychiatric disorders among refugees from Syria and Iraq requiring exceptional, United Nations-funded care in a country of first asylum.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees works with multi-disciplinary, in-country exceptional care committees to review refugees' applications for emergency or exceptional medical care. Neuropsychiatric diagnoses among refugee applicants were identified through a retrospective review of applications to the Jordanian Exceptional Care Committee (2012-2013). Diagnoses were made using International Classification of Disease-10(th) edition codes rendered by treating physicians.\nNeuropsychiatric applications accounted for 11% (264/2526) of all Exceptional Care Committee applications, representing 223 refugees (40% female; median age 35\u00a0years; 57% Syrian, 36% Iraqi, 7% other countries of origin). Two-thirds of neuropsychiatric cases were for emergency care. The total amount requested for neuropsychiatric disorders was 925,674 USD. Syrian refugees were significantly more likely to request neurotrauma care than Iraqis (18/128 vs. 3/80, p\u2009=\u20090.03). The most expensive care per person was for brain tumor (7,905 USD), multiple sclerosis (7,502 USD), and nervous system trauma (6,466 USD), although stroke was the most frequent diagnosis. Schizophrenia was the most costly and frequent diagnosis among the psychiatric disorders (2,269 USD per person, 27,226 USD total).\nNeuropsychiatric disorders, including those traditionally considered outside the purview of refugee health, are an important burden to health among Iraqi and Syrian refugees.

Beside these academic syndromic manifestations, some nonvascular neurological manifestations of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLAbs) are progressively emerging, being associated with a wide range of polymorphic neurological, psychological and psychiatric manifestations. Animal models and in vitro experimental data support an immune-mediated pathogenesis, with direct binding and effect of aPLAbs on neurons and glial cells which are thought to occur after a disruption or a permeability alteration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

This minimum level of structural quality will probably be abolished in the context of the convergence of hospital budgets starting in 2019.\nThe aim of this study was to analyze the current fulfilment of staffing regulations in terms of time per patient in a large nationwide sample.\nThe required minutes of staff time as defined by staffing regulations were calculated for each patient using the treatment classifications provided by a large nationwide database. The actual use of staff time was calculated on the basis of average costs published by the German Institute for Hospital Reimbursement. Both figures were compared to calculate the fulfilment of staffing regulations.\nThe study included approximately 95,000 inpatient episodes from 46 psychiatric hospitals and departments with a total length of stay of almost 2.5 million days. On average, the weekly use of staff resources per patient was 190\u00a0min (10\u2009%) below the requirements of the staffing regulations. The largest gap in absolute terms was found in nursing staff where the weekly time per patient was 189\u00a0min (14\u2009%) below the requirements of the staffing regulations.\nThe convergence of psychiatric hospital budgets starts in 2019 below a level of funding required to fulfil staffing regulations. This would perpetuate inadequately funded structures and should initially be opposed with a demand for complete fulfilment of staffing regulations. Thereafter, a normative consent should be reached to define the resources required for current inpatient mental health care."}, {"Title": "Common and rare variants of microRNA genes in autism spectrum disorders.", "Abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators that have been shown to be involved in disease susceptibility.

A replication study was performed in a sample of 449 ASD cases and 415 controls. Additionally, rare variants in 701 miRNA genes of 41 ASD patients were examined using whole-exome sequencing.\nThe most significant association in the discovery sample was obtained for the miR-133b/miR-206 cluster (rs16882131, P = 0.00037). The replication study did not reach significance. However, the pooled analysis (1,085 cases and 1,088 controls) showed association with two miRNA clusters: miR-133b/miR-206 (rs16882131, permP = 0.037) and miR-17/miR-18a/miR-19a/miR-20a/miR-19b-1/miR92a-1 (rs6492538, permP = 0.019). Both miR-133b and miR-206 regulate the MET gene, previously associated with ASD. Rare variant analysis identified mutations in several miRNA genes, among them miR-541, a brain-specific miRNA that regulates SYN1, found mutated in ASD.\nAlthough our results do not establish a clear role for miRNAs in ASD, we pinpointed a few candidate genes.

Trainees were divided into small groups. Each trainee undertook two scenarios each. Feedback was delivered by facilitators, peers and the simulated patients. Written feedback was also given.\nThe courses were delivered in a local postgraduate medical education centre.\nActors were used to simulate adult psychiatric patients and their relatives. Other scenarios involved actors portraying colleagues.\nThe simulations offered an opportunity for experiential learning while the debriefs allowed for focused feedback on trainees' communication styles.\nChanges in trainees' perception of their ability to deal with difficult situations at work were measured. Semistructured interviews further explored trainees' experience of the course and its educational impact.\n100% (n=39) of the trainees felt that their communication skills had improved after the training. 97% felt more able to defuse an angry/tense situation at work while 92% felt more able to deal with a difficult situation requiring sophisticated communication skills. 97% felt that regular simulation training would be valuable while 100% (n=24) of facilitators agreed that the experience was valuable to the trainees' professional development. Qualitative analysis showed that trainees found the scenarios realistic, that the experience had led to an increased awareness of their communication style and that original improvements in confidence had translated to their clinical work.\nThe programme demonstrates that it is possible to use simulation in a simple, inexpensive and time-effective manner to provide realistic, enjoyable and educationally beneficial advanced communication skill training relevant to psychiatric practice."}, {"Title": "How animal models inform child and adolescent psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Every available approach should be used to advance the field of child and adolescent psychiatry.

Model systems have not only demonstrated causality of risk factors for psychiatric pathophysiology, but have also allowed child psychiatrists to think in different ways about risks for psychiatric disorders and multiple levels that might be the basis of recovery and prevention.\nWe present examples of how animal systems are used to benefit child psychiatry, including through environmental, genetic, and acute biological manipulations. Animal model work has been essential in our current thinking about childhood disorders, including the importance of dose and timing of risk factors, specific features of risk factors that are significant, neurochemistry involved in brain functioning, molecular components of brain development, and the importance of cellular processes previously neglected in psychiatric theories.\nAnimal models have clear advantages and disadvantages that must be considered for these systems to be useful.

This study was done to evaluate the impact on marriage when donation occurs to someone other than the spouse. Two groups of donors from our centre who donated around the same period were studied: donation to a spouse (spouse donor (SD)) or to someone other than the spouse (non-spouse donor (ND)). A survey, the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale, was used to evaluate the effect of donation on the marriage. This tool consists of 14 questions that measure how satisfying and stable the relationship is. The results showed equal or better marriage scores in the ND group compared with the SD group. The NDs scored higher on two questions, one regarding agreement or disagreement on career choices (P\u2009=\u20090.05) and the other regarding the frequency of having stimulating exchanges of ideas with one's spouse (P\u2009=\u20090.02). With the highest possible total score of 69, NDs scored 53.4 and SDs scored 47.7 (P\u2009=\u20090.16). Scores of 47 and below indicate marital distress.

Deliberations included clinically useful and viable biomarkers, why suitable markers are not available, and the need for tightly-controlled sample collection.\nDifferent types of biomarkers, appropriate sensitivity, specificity, and broad-based exploitability were discussed. Whilst a number of candidates are in the discovery phases, all will require replication in larger, real-life cohorts. Clinical cost-effectiveness also needs to be established.\nSince a single measure is unlikely to suffice, multi-modal strategies look more promising, although they bring greater technical and implementation complexities.

Depressed older depressed adults also reported more anhedonia compared to younger adults, but no differences in terms of reported sadness were found. Finally, older and younger adults differed in their descriptions of symptoms with older adults describing anxiety as feeling stressed and tense, while younger adults described anxiety as feeling anxious, worried or nervous.\nClinicians need to assess symptoms broadly to avoid missing the presence of anxiety and mood disorders especially in older adults."}, {"Title": "[Diagnosis of Metabolic Risk Factors in Psychiatric Inpatients].", "Abstract": "Individuals suffering from mental illness have one to two decades reduced life expectancy. The increased morbidity and mortality is mainly due to cardiometabolic disorders. Despite these numbers, international studies give evidence that diagnoses and treatment of metabolic risk factors in psychiatric patients is insufficient. We assume that in Germany metabolic risk factors are also underdiagnosed and insufficiently treated.\nWe tested for the frequency of diagnoses of the metabolic risk factors obesity, nicotine dependence and abuse, disorders of lipid metabolism, hypertension and diabetes in 139\u200a307 cases of residential treatment and semi-residential care in 47 psychiatric hospitals in Germany in the year 2012. Data were derived from the VIPP(indicators of treatment quality in psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine)-project, a project that comprises the routine data of psychiatric hospitals, that are sent to the InEK (institute for the lump sum payment system for hospitals). Frequencies were compared with prevalence of metabolic risk factors in the German population and prevalences of metabolic risk factors found in psychiatric patients in international studies.\nIn particular obesity (2.8\u200a%), disorders of lipid metabolism (2.8\u200a%) and nicotin dependence (4.2\u200a%) were underdiagnosed. We assume that also diabetes (6.8\u200a%) and hypertension (17.7\u200a%) were underdiagnosed.\nThe results give evidence that metabolic risk factors are underdiagnosed and possibly insufficiently treated in German psychiatric hospitals.

The database includes the annual number of newly diagnosed outpatients with ADHD in Slovenia. The evaluation for ADHD diagnoses was done in accordance with the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) outpatient data codes. In model 1, a linear increase was proposed to fit the data in the period from 1997 to 2003 in order to extrapolate the data before 1997. In model 2 and 3, an exponential increase in the annual incidence rate was proposed.\nThe incidence rate of ADHD diagnosis in 1997 was 0.032% and in 2012 it increased to 0.082%. Mean prevalence rate was 750 (95% confidence interval: 660-840) per 100\u2009000 children and adolescents. It was estimated that the prevalence rate in 2020 would be 1% (95% confidence interval: 0.875-1.125), which is 6.3-fold higher than in 1997.\nADHD is a common mental health disorder among Slovenian children and adolescents, but it remained underdiagnosed compared with Western countries.

The question is how do we better motivate and engage learners within the session. Thus, we incorporated narratives into the learning environment and hypothesised that the use of narratives in the teaching of biomedical research ethics and informed consent would be associated with greater engagement, motivation, understanding, reflective learning and effectiveness of the teaching session.\nThe narratives were chosen from the history of research ethics and the humanities literature related to human subject research. Learners were asked to provide post-session feedback through an anonymised questionnaire on their learning session. An outcomes logic model was used for assessment with focus on immediate outcomes such as engagement, motivation, understanding and reflective learning.\nOverall, 70.5% (N\u2009=\u2009273) of the learners responded to the questionnaire. Amongst the respondents, 92.6% (N\u2009=\u2009253) of the participants ranked use of narratives as most helpful in appreciating the historical context of research ethics and informed consent in research.

This study examined when doctors in this new system make specialty choices, which factors influence choices, and whether doctors who choose a specialty they were interested in at medical school are more confident in their choice than those doctors whose interests change post-graduation.\nTwo cohorts of students in their penultimate year at one medical school (n = 227/239) were asked which specialty interested them as a career. Two years later, 210/227 were sent a questionnaire measuring actual specialty chosen, confidence, influence of perceptions of the specialty and experiences on choice, satisfaction with medicine, personality, self-efficacy, and demographics. Medical school and post-graduation choices in the same category were deemed 'stable'. Predictors of stability, and of not having chosen a specialty, were calculated using bootstrapped logistic regression. Differences between specialties on questionnaire factors were analysed.\n50% responded (n = 105/277; 44% of the 239 Year 4 students). 65% specialty choices were 'stable'. Factors univariately associated with stability were specialty chosen, having enjoyed the specialty at medical school or since starting work, having first considered the specialty earlier. A regression found doctors who chose psychiatry were more likely to have changed choice than those who chose general practice. Confidence in the choice was not associated with stability. Those who chose general practice valued lifestyle factors. A psychiatry choice was associated with needing a job and using one's intellect to help others. The decision to choose surgical training tended to be made early. Not having applied for specialty training was associated with being lower on agreeableness and conscientiousness.\nMedical school experiences are important in specialty choice but experiences post-graduation remain significant, particularly in some specialties (psychiatry in our sample). Career guidance is important at medical school and should be continued post-graduation, with senior clinicians supported in advising juniors. Careers advice in the first year post-graduation may be particularly important, especially for specialties which have difficulty recruiting or are poorly represented at medical school."}, {"Title": "'Simulation-based learning in psychiatry for undergraduates at the University of Zimbabwe medical school'.", "Abstract": "The use of simulated patients to teach in psychiatry has not been reported from low-income countries. This is the first study using simulation teaching in psychiatry in Africa. The aim of this study was to introduce a novel method of psychiatric teaching to medical students at the University of Zimbabwe and assess its feasibility and preliminary effectiveness. We selected depression to simulate because students in Zimbabwe are most likely to see cases of psychoses during their ward-based clinical exposure.\nZimbabwean psychiatrists adapted scenarios on depression and suicide based on ones used in London. Zimbabwean post-graduate trainee psychiatrists were invited to carry out the teaching and psychiatric nursing staff were recruited and trained in one hour to play the simulated patients (SPs). All students undertaking their psychiatry placement (n = 30) were allocated into groups for a short didactic lecture on assessing for clinical depression and then rotated around 3 scenarios in groups of 4-5 and asked to interview a simulated patient with signs of depression. Students received feedback from peers, SPs and facilitators. Students completed the Confidence in Assessing and Managing Depression (CAM-D) questionnaire before and after the simulation session and provided written free-text feedback.\nPost-graduate trainers, together with one consultant, facilitated the simulated teaching after three hours training. Student confidence scores increased from mean 15.90 to 20.05 (95% CI = 2.58- 5.71) t (20) = 5.52, (p > 0.0001) following the simulation teaching session. Free-text feedback was positive overall with students commenting that it was \"helpful\", \"enjoyable\" and \"boosted confidence\".\nIn Zimbabwe, simulation teaching was acceptable and could be adapted with minimal effort by local psychiatrists and implemented by post-graduate trainees and one consultant, Students found it helpful and enjoyable and their confidence increased after the teaching. It offers students a broader exposure to psychiatric conditions than they receive during clinical attachment to the inpatient wards.

Psychiatry is an unpopular career choice for many medical students and this impacts negatively on the supply of psychiatrists to the workforce. The psychiatry clerkship can play an important role in influencing students' attitudes towards psychiatry, either positively or negatively. However, stigma towards mental illness detracts students from considering a career in psychiatry. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of an eight week psychiatry clerkship on i) student knowledge and interest in psychiatry; ii) psychiatry as a career choice; iii) attitudes towards psychiatry; and iv) perceptions of stigma towards mental illness.\nYear 4 medical students at the University of Western Australia completed two questionnaires, the Balon Attitudes Towards Psychiatry and the Mental Illness Clinicians Attitudes (MICA), at the beginning and end of the psychiatry clerkship. Interest in, knowledge of, and consideration of psychiatry as a career were also assessed. Non-parametric tests were used to compare baseline and follow-up differences on the Balon and MICA. Unpaired t-tests compared mean differences for interest, knowledge and psychiatry as a career.\nAttitudes towards psychiatry were positive at the beginning of the clerkship. Overall, there was a significant decrease in negative and stigmatising views towards mental illness post clerkship measured by the MICA, but the follow-up mean score remained close to the neutral value with views in some areas becoming more negative. There was no significant improvement in students' interest in psychiatry post clerkship, however, knowledge of psychiatry improved significantly. Numbers of students 'definitely considering' psychiatry as a career increased significantly from 7 (4.6%) students at baseline to 17 (10.5%) at follow-up.\nThe clerkship made a modest impact on students' attitudes to psychiatry, stigma and consideration of psychiatry as a career. Integration of strategies to overcome stigma towards mental illness and the mental health profession into pre-clinical teaching may provide students with skills to prepare them for the clerkship.

One argument against respect for dignity as a principle is that anything it stands for can be subsumed into respecting people's autonomy. This seems not to be correct. Another argument has been that the term dignity has too often been used loosely and vaguely. This does not mean that the term itself is necesarily without value.

For these reasons, the purpose of this project was to explore survey response rates among physician specialists in a large metropolitan Canadian city.\nAs part of a larger project to look at physician payment plans, an online survey about medical billing practices was distributed to 904 physicians from various medical specialties. The primary method for physicians to complete the survey was via the Internet using a well-known and established survey company (www.surveymonkey.com). Multiple methods were used to encourage survey response such as individual personalized email invitations, multiple reminders, and a draw for three gift certificate prizes were used to increase response rate. Descriptive statistics were used to assess response rates and reasons for non-response.\nOverall survey response rate was 35.0%. Response rates varied by specialty: Neurology/neurosurgery (46.6%); internal medicine (42.9%); general surgery (29.6%); pediatrics (29.2%); and psychiatry (27.1%). Non-respondents listed lack of time/survey burden as the main reason for not responding to our survey.\nOur survey results provide a look into the challenges of collecting healthcare research where response rates to surveys are often low.

Although mental disorders comprise mostly functional abnormalities, there is a substantial overlap between neurology and psychiatry in addressing cognitive disturbances. In schizophrenia, the presence of cognitive impairment prior to the onset of psychosis and early after its manifestation suggests that some neurocognitive abnormalities precede the onset of psychosis and may represent a trait marker. These cognitive alterations may arise from functional disconnectivity, as no significant brain damage has been found. In this review we aim to revise A.R. Luria's systematic approach used in the neuropsychological evaluation of cognitive functions, which was primarily applied in patients with neurological disorders and in the cognitive evaluation in schizophrenia and other related disorders. As proposed by Luria, cognitive processes, associated with higher cortical functions, may represent functional systems that are not localized in narrow, circumscribed areas of the brain, but occur among groups of concertedly working brain structures, each of which makes its own particular contribution to the organization of the functional system. Current developments in neuroscience provide evidence of functional connectivity in the brain. Therefore, Luria's approach may serve as a frame of reference for the analysis and interpretation of cognitive functions in general and their abnormalities in schizophrenia in particular. Having said that, modern technology, as well as experimental evidence, may help us to understand the brain better and lead us towards creating a new classification of cognitive functions. In schizophrenia research, multidisciplinary approaches must be utilized to address specific cognitive alterations. The relationships among the components of cognitive functions derived from the functional connectivity of the brain may provide an insight into cognitive machinery."}, {"Title": "Combination therapy with monoamine oxidase inhibitors and other antidepressants or stimulants: strategies for the management of treatment-resistant depression.", "Abstract": "Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a major health concern. More than 40% of patients treated for major depressive disorder with an appropriate antidepressant dose for an adequate duration fail to respond. Further, approximately half of adults with major depressive disorder fail to achieve sustained remission despite various medication trials. The utilization of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) for the treatment of depression in clinical practice today is low due to their widely known adverse effects, some of which may be life threatening, and the risk for dietary and drug interactions. For these reasons, MAOIs are not recommended to be prescribed along with other antidepressants or certain prescription or nonprescription drugs. Pharmacologic options are limited for individuals with TRD, however, and there is a paucity of data on the efficacy of MAOIs in combination with other antidepressants for the management of TRD. We performed a search of the PubMed database (inception through January 25, 2015) to identify cases that illustrate the potential utility, as well as risks, of combination treatment with MAOIs and other antidepressants for the management of TRD; 18 articles met the criteria for our search. In addition, we performed a retrospective case series by reviewing the medical records of 29 adults treated for depression with an MAOI plus another psychotropic agent (an antidepressant or stimulant medication) between 2003 and 2012 at a large Midwestern teaching hospital. We compared the findings of the published experience with our local experience to allow for more informed decisions regarding pharmacotherapy in patients with TRD. We separated the local experience into two groups: 15 cases with the selective MAO type B inhibitor selegiline combined with medications presumed to increase the risk of serotonin syndrome and 14 cases with nonselective MAOIs (phenelzine and tranylcypromine) combined with other contraindicated medications. Although risks of combination treatment certainly exist with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or clomipramine, the current literature supports cautious use of combining MAOIs with other antidepressants in patients with TRD who have failed multiple treatment modalities. In addition, the data from the 29 patients receiving combination therapy with an MAOI and another antidepressant or stimulant medication revealed that 21% improved significantly, with no complications. This case series and literature review suggest that when used under close supervision and under the care of an experienced clinician in psychiatry, combination therapy may be a consideration for the management of TRD in patients not responding to monotherapy or other combinations of antidepressants."}, {"Title": "Neuroimaging Biomarkers for Psychosis.", "Abstract": "Biomarkers provide clinicians with a predictable model for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of medical ailments.

As explained in the first part of the paper, due to the recently increased emigration of Greek psychiatrists and psychiatric trainees, and the fact that the United Kingdom is a popular destination, it has become necessary to inform those aspiring to train in the United Kingdom of the system and the circumstances they should expect to encounter. This paper principally describes the structure of the United Kingdom's psychiatric training system, including the different stages trainees progress through and their respective requirements and processes. Specifically, specialty and subspecialty options are described and explained, special paths in training are analysed, and the notions of \"special interest day\" and the optional \"Out of programme experience\" schemes are explained. Furthermore, detailed information is offered on the pivotal points of each of the stages of the training process, with special care to explain the important differences and similarities between the systems in Greece and the United Kingdom. Special attention is given to The Royal College of Psychiatrists' Membership Exams (MRCPsych) because they are the only exams towards completing specialisation in Psychiatry in the United Kingdom. Also, the educational culture of progressing according to a set curriculum, of utilising diverse means of professional development, of empowering the trainees' autonomy by allowing initiative-based development and of applying peer supervision as a tool for professional development is stressed. We conclude that psychiatric training in the United Kingdom differs substantially to that of Greece in both structure and process. \u03a4here are various differences such as pure psychiatric training in the United Kingdom versus neurological and medical modules in Greece, in-training exams in the United Kingdom versus an exit exam in Greece, and of course the three years of higher training, which prepares trainees towards functioning as consultants. However, perhaps the most important difference is one of mentality; namely a culture of competency- based training progression in the United Kingdom, which further extends beyond training into professional revalidation. We believe that, with careful cultural adaptation, the systems of psychiatric training in the United Kingdom and Greece may benefit from sharing some of their features.

DSM-5 has introduced Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome (APS) as a condition for further study, arguing for its clinical validity and the need for identifying sub- threshold psychotic states. Early psychosis intervention has an already established role in reducing the Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP), delaying psychosis onset and relieving Ultra High Risk (UHR) individuals from their presenting symptoms. Pharmacological and mainly psycho-therapeutical approaches are suggested for this purpose. Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) seems to have clear evidence of favorable outcome concerning transition to psychosis rates, omega-3 fatty acids lower but promising evidence, while low-dose antipsychotic medication or antidepressant treatment may seem beneficial, but it remains unclear if the reported favorable effects persist in the long term and how long intervention in UHR subjects should be given for. Case management and close monitoring based on principles of social psychiatry are considered key elements for the management of UHR individuals. However, the blazing case about early psychosis concerns the accurate specification of the prodromal stage of psychosis, which may set the basis for meaningful and effective early intervention. Although psychometric tools have been developed and provide a common criteria-based recognition method, debate is alive and well regarding \"false positive\" cases, since most UHR subjects will not finally develop psychosis. Moreover, transition rates to psychosis have been declining over the years, leading to fierce criticism over the validity of the UHR/ APS state and legitimacy of its treatment. On this framework, ethical issues of stigmatizing through unnecessary diagnosing and antipsychotics' prescribing are matters of serious questioning. Clinical heterogeneity and high comorbidity are further implications of the UHR state. Current research emphasizes on improving validity of inclusion criteria and formulating personalised and clinical stage- based intervention strategies. In order to do that, early psychosis recognition and intervention services are established throughout the world, trying to contribute in research by applying clinical, cognitive or neuropsychological criteria. Nevertheless, in the majority of so far conducted studies, samples sizes are considered small and duration of follow-up short, which are limitations yet to overcome. Other scientific voices argue that the UHR state might represent a non-specific risk factor for psychiatric disorders in general and not necessarily for psychosis and tend to examine the UHR and early intervention idea under the prism of subthreshold or early mental distress state. Either way, recognizing and intervening early in emerging psychiatric states, especially in those with psychotic or psychotic-like symptomatology, share indisputable benefits under the broader concept of prevention, setting a strong scientific-clinical rationale for service provision to help-seeking people and the possibility of changing the course for those with vulnerability to psychotic illnesses."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric patients' perspectives of student involvement in their care.", "Abstract": "In the education of professionals in psychiatry, one challenge is to provide clinical placements with opportunities for students to interact and have direct contact with patients.

We hypothesised also that this difference in matched scores would predict objective progress including conditional discharge.\nIn a prospective naturalistic observational cohort study in a forensic hospital, we examined whether scores on the self-rated DUNDRUM-3 programme completion and DUNDRUM-4 recovery scales or differences between clinician and patient ratings on the same scales (concordance) would predict moves between levels of therapeutic security and conditional discharge over the next twelve months.\nBoth scales stratified along the recovery pathway of the hospital, but clinician ratings matched the level of therapeutic security more accurately than self ratings. The clinician rated scales predicted moves to less secure units and to more secure units and predicted conditional discharge but the self-rated scores did not. The difference between clinician and self-rated scores (concordance) predicted positive and negative moves and conditional discharge, but this was not always an independent predictor as shown by regression analysis. In regression analysis the DUNDRUM-3 predicted moves to less secure places though the HCR-20 C & R score dominated the model. Moves back to more secure places were predicted by lack of concordance on the DUNDRUM-4. Conditional discharge was predicted predominantly by the DUNDRUM-3.\nPatients accurately self-rate relative to other patients however their absolute ratings were consistently lower (better) than clinicians' ratings and were less accurate predictors of outcomes including conditional discharge. Quantifying concordance is a useful part of the recovery process and predicts outcomes but self-ratings are not accurate predictors."}, {"Title": "Microsurgical Penile Replantation after Self-inflicted Amputation in a Schizophrenic Patient: 5-year Follow-up.", "Abstract": "In this article, we report on the long-term follow-up of a microvascular penile replantation resulting from self-inflicted amputation in a schizophrenic patient.

This review presents the summary of research on potential genetic basis of neuroplasticity-modulation mechanism underlying tDCS and its implications for treating various psychiatric disorders.\nA systematic review highlighting the genes involved in neuroplasticity and their role in psychiatric disorders was carried out. The focus was on the established genetic findings of tDCS response relationship with BDNF and COMT gene polymorphisms.\nSynthesis of these preliminary observations suggests the potential influence of neuroplastic genes on tDCS treatment response. These include several animal models, pharmacological studies, mentally ill and healthy human subject trials.\nTaking into account the rapidly unfolding understanding of tDCS and the role of synaptic plasticity disturbances in neuropsychiatric disorders, in-depth evaluation of the mechanism of action pertinent to neuroplasticity modulation with tDCS needs further systematic research. Genes such as NRG1, DISC1, as well as those linked with the glutamatergic receptor in the context of their direct role in the modulation of neuronal signalling related to neuroplasticity aberrations, are leading candidates for future research in this area. Such research studies might potentially unravel observations that might have potential translational implications in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Resource use and financing of guideline-adherent psychotherapeutic inpatient care].", "Abstract": "The financing of psychiatric psychotherapeutic care in Germany is determined by the German psychiatric staffing regulations which are unchanged since 1991.

A further aim was to compare these results to the resources defined by the German psychiatric staffing regulations and in the new prospective payment system for psychiatry and psychosomatics in Germany.\nUniversity hospitals for psychiatry and psychotherapy were asked to retrospectively provide data of patients for which guideline-adherent care was possible. Participating institutions provided both data describing the staff time utilization of psychotherapeutic services provided by psychiatrists and psychologists and patient classifications according to the German psychiatric staffing regulations and the new prospective payment system for psychiatry and psychosomatics.\nResources defined by the German psychiatric staffing regulations covered a mean of only 71 min of psychotherapy per patient and week while the actual mean intensity of psychotherapeutic care provided by the participating hospitals was 194 min per patient and week. The associated use of staff time was 102 min per patient and week. Both figures increased during an inpatient episode. The resources defined by the German psychiatric staffing regulations covered only 70\u2009% of medical and psychological personnel. The current configuration of the new prospective payment system for psychiatry and psychosomatics covered only 59\u2009% of staff time.\nThe results of this study provide another unambiguous recommendation to adjust the out-dated German psychiatric staffing regulations to the current evidence and S3 guidelines for psychiatric psychotherapeutic hospital care.

This qualitative study explores old age psychiatrists' experience of and approach to working with patients at the EOL.\nAustralian old age psychiatrists were purposively sampled and interviewed in-depth. Data saturation was achieved after nine participant interviews. Verbatim transcripts were analysed for themes, which were independently verified.\nTwo dichotomous overarching themes were identified. Death is not our business reflected participants' experience of working in a mental health framework and incorporated four themes: death should not occur in psychiatry; working in a psychiatric treatment model; keeping a distance from death and unexpected death is a negative experience. Death is our business reflected participants' experience of working in an aged care context and incorporated four themes: death is part of life; encountering the EOL through dementia care; doing EOL work and expected death is a positive experience.\nParticipants reported conflict because of the contradictory domains in which they work. They were comfortable working with patients at the EOL when death was expected, particularly in dementia. By contrast, they struggled with death as an adverse outcome in circumstances influenced by mental health culture, which was characterised by risk management, suicide prevention and a focus on recovery.

In France, criminal assessment is not contradictory. The psychiatric expert is commissioned by judges to determine whether or not the accused has a mental disorder and specify whether it affects discernment and control of actions at the time of offense. Its mission focuses on the mental element required to constitute an offense, and is structured around Article 122-1 of the Criminal Code. This article, composed of two paragraphs, distinguishes the framework of the abolition of discernment \u2014 a cause of non-imputability and therefore of a statement of lack of criminal responsibility due to mental disorder \u2014 and the framework of the alteration of discernment. Nowadays expertise seems to meet discomfort, with criticism focusing on possible differences among psychiatric experts, without specific studies having been conducted to confirm it.\nOur objective was to identify the main points of disagreement between psychiatric experts and to propose explicative hypotheses.\nFor this, we carried out a literature review on PubMed, Science Direct and Cairn, and studied the report of the 2007 public hearing on forensic psychiatric assessment with contributions from different authors. The keywords were: forensic psychiatry, psychiatric court report, psychiatric expertise, differences among experts, legal responsibility, and discernment. We defined differences as disagreements between experts, or as a mismatch in conclusions and approaches of experts.\nThe differences among experts concerned mainly forensic interpretation, i.e. the discussion of the relationship between pathology and offense, particularly in contexts that involve a larger forensic discussion, including interruption of medication, use of drugs, association with antisocial personality, premeditation, denial of facts, especially when the accused suffers from a mental illness (especially schizophrenia). For a finding of abolition of discernment, an expert must consider two requirements, one temporal (the mental disease must be active during offense) and the other causal that involves seeking a direct and exclusive relationship between the offence and the mental state, according to expert jurisprudence. Some experts do not comply with these two requirements or this jurisprudence, whence differences. There were also diagnostic differences and disputes relating to the concept of \"alteration of discernment\". Disagreements appeared to be related primarily to personal ideologies or different schools of thought that influenced interpretations and conclusions of experts, e.g. accountability as a therapeutic response for the psychotic person. Then, the lack of clarity of expert mission regarding necessary causal relationship \u2014 between any disease and crime \u2014 to demonstrate to conclude an abolition of discernment, could also contribute to differences. Moreover, time available to achieve the mission is too short and the expert would not devote enough time to an expert examination, which could lead to less good expertise and differences; especially as observed clinical examination in expertise is sometimes difficult, misleading, due to pathological reticence of accused mentally ill but also sometimes due to possible simulations. Finally, the low quality of some expert reports \u2014 due in part to the less well-trained experts, but also the particular conditions of achievement of expertise, especially in prisons \u2014 were mentioned by some authors as causes of differences.\nIt appears from this review of literature that differences mainly concern forensic interpretation and are mainly explained by ideologies.

Understanding dysfunctional brain network profiles in task-active states provides important information on network engagement in an experimental context. This in turn may be predictive of many of the cognitive and behavioral deficits associated with complex behavioral phenotypes. Here we investigated brain network profiles in youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), contrasting them with a group of age-comparable controls. Network interactions were assessed during simple working memory: in particular, we focused on the modulation by the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) of cortical, striatal, and thalamic regions. The focus on the dACC was motivated by its hypothesized role in the pathophysiology of OCD. However, its task-active network signatures have not been investigated before. Network interactions were modeled using psychophysiological interaction, a simple directional model of seed to target brain interactions. Our results indicate that OCD is characterized by significantly increased dACC modulation of cortical, striatal, and thalamic targets during working memory, and that this aberrant increase in OCD patients is maintained regardless of working memory demand. The results constitute compelling evidence of dysfunctional brain network interactions in OCD and suggest that these interactions may be related to a combination of network inefficiencies and dACC hyper-activity that has been associated with the phenotype."}, {"Title": "Attenuated psychosis syndrome: benefits of explicit recognition.", "Abstract": "Given the unique characteristics of people who meet criteria for attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) and the growing literature on the clinical benefits of providing services to individuals who meet these criteria, the APS diagnosis serves an important, and previously missing, role in psychiatry. The promotion of the APS diagnosis should help reduce the over-diagnosis and over-treatment of individuals with prodromal psychotic conditions and it should also encourage expanded training about attenuated psychosis among clinicians who primarily provide services to youth (a primary group who are diagnosed with APS). Only some of the individuals with APS subsequently develop psychosis, but all have existing clinical needs - regardless of subsequent conversion. The formal recognition of APS in DSM-5 will facilitate the research needed to identify and meet those needs."}, {"Title": "Prevalence of abuse in mentally ill patients visiting outpatient setting in a tertiary care hospital in India.", "Abstract": "In a developing country such as India, the abuse of patients suffering from psychiatric disorders has been underreported. The aim of this study was to detect abuse in chronically ill psychiatric patients visiting a psychiatric outpatient setting in a tertiary care hospital in Delhi, India.\nA cross-sectional descriptive written survey was carried out on 406 patients. A self-administered questionnaire for patient abuse was developed in Hindi based on the World Health Organization's Domestic Violence Questionnaire that encompassed questions regarding physical, emotional and sexual abuse.\nOf the 406 patients, 294 (72%) suffered from abuse, with 64% experiencing emotional abuse, 39% physical abuse and 21% sexual abuse. In chronically ill psychiatric patients, a significant association was found between education and abuse, with most abuse occurring among senior secondary pass outs (i.e. 11-12 years of education) and least among junior high school pass outs (6-8 years of education). A majority (74%) of these patients lived in urban areas (p\u2009=\u2009.020). A significant association was also found between abuse and the psychiatric diagnosis of the patient, with 53% suffering from depression, 66% anxiety disorder, 81% bipolar disorder, 94% psychotic disorder, 86% obsessive compulsive disorder, 44% sexual disorder and 12% other psychiatric disorders.\nThere is a need to create awareness in society in order to prevent abuse. Screening for abuse in routine psychiatric practice is of utmost importance so that timely interventions can be given, thereby preventing its deleterious health consequences."}, {"Title": "Genetics in child and adolescent psychiatry: methodological advances and conceptual issues.", "Abstract": "Discovering the genetic basis of early-onset psychiatric disorders has been the aim of intensive research during the last decade. We will first selectively summarize results of genetic research in child and adolescent psychiatry by using examples from different disorders and discuss methodological issues, emerging questions and future directions. In the second part of this review, we will focus on how to link genetic causes of disorders with physiological pathways, discuss the impact of genetic findings on diagnostic systems, prevention and therapeutic interventions. Finally we will highlight some ethical aspects connected to genetic research in child and adolescent psychiatry. Advances in molecular genetic methods have led to insights into the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders, but not yet provided definite pathways to pathophysiology. If replicated, promising findings from genetic studies might in some cases lead to personalized treatments. On the one hand, knowledge of the genetic basis of disorders may influence diagnostic categories. On the other hand, models also suggest studying the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders across diagnoses and clinical groups."}, {"Title": "The association of students requiring remediation in the internal medicine clerkship with poor performance during internship.", "Abstract": "To determine whether the Uniformed Services University (USU) system of workplace performance assessment for students in the internal medicine clerkship at the USU continues to be a sensitive predictor of subsequent poor performance during internship, when compared with assessments in other USU third year clerkships.\nUtilizing Program Director survey results from 2007 through 2011 and U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 3 examination results as the outcomes of interest, we compared performance during internship for students who had less than passing performance in the internal medicine clerkship and required remediation, against students whose performance in the internal medicine clerkship was successful. We further analyzed internship ratings for students who received less than passing grades during the same time period on other third year clerkships such as general surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, family medicine, and psychiatry to evaluate whether poor performance on other individual clerkships were associated with future poor performance at the internship level. Results for this recent cohort of graduates were compared with previously published findings.\nThe overall survey response rate for this 5 year cohort was 81% (689/853). Students who received a less than passing grade in the internal medicine clerkship and required further remediation were 4.5 times more likely to be given poor ratings in the domain of medical expertise and 18.7 times more likely to demonstrate poor professionalism during internship. Further, students requiring internal medicine remediation were 8.5 times more likely to fail USMLE Step 3. No other individual clerkship showed any statistically significant associations with performance at the intern level. On the other hand, 40% of students who successfully remediated and did graduate were not identified during internship as having poor performance.\nUnsuccessful clinical performance which requires remediation in the third year internal medicine clerkship at Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences continues to be strongly associated with poor performance at the internship level. No significant associations existed between any of the other clerkships and poor performance during internship and Step 3 failure. The strength of this association with the internal medicine clerkship is most likely because of an increased level of sensitivity in detecting poor performance."}, {"Title": "Is psychiatry only neurology? Or only abnormal psychology? D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu after 100 years.", "Abstract": "Forgetting history, which frequently repeats itself, is a mistake. In General Psychopathology, Jaspers criticised early 20th century psychiatrists, including those who thought psychiatry was only neurology (Wernicke) or only abnormal psychology (Freud), or who did not see the limitations of the medical model in psychiatry (Kraepelin). Jaspers proposed that some psychiatric disorders follow the medical model (Group I), while others are variations of normality (Group III), or comprise schizophrenia and severe mood disorders (Group II). In the early 21st century, the players' names have changed but the game remains the same. The US NIMH is reprising both Wernicke's brain mythology and Kraepelin's marketing promises. The neo-Kraepelinian revolution started at Washington University, became pre-eminent through the DSM-III developed by Spitzer, but reached a dead end with the DSM-5. McHugh, who described four perspectives in psychiatry, is the leading contemporary representative of the Jaspersian diagnostic approach. Other neo-Jaspersians are: Berrios, Wiggins and Schwartz, Ghaemi, Stanghellini, Parnas and Sass. Can psychiatry learn from its mistakes? The current psychiatric language, organised at its three levels, symptoms, syndromes, and disorders, was developed in the 19th century but is obsolete for the 21st century. Scientific advances in Jaspers' Group III disorders require collaborating with researchers in the social and psychological sciences. Jaspers' Group II disorders, redefined by the author as schizophrenia, catatonic syndromes, and severe mood disorders, are the core of psychiatry. Scientific advancement in them is not easy because we are not sure how to delineate between and within them correctly."}, {"Title": "Stimulation mapping of white matter tracts to study brain functional connectivity.", "Abstract": "Despite advances in the new science of connectomics, which aims to comprehensively map neural connections at both structural and functional levels, techniques to directly study the function of white matter tracts in vivo in humans have proved elusive. Direct electrical stimulation (DES) mapping of the subcortical fibres offers a unique opportunity to investigate the functional connectivity of the brain. This original method permits real-time anatomo-functional correlations, especially with regard to neural pathways, in awake patients undergoing brain surgery. In this article, the goal is to review new insights, gained from axonal DES, into the functional connectivity underlying the sensorimotor, visuospatial, language and sociocognitive systems. Interactions between these neural networks and multimodal systems, such as working memory, attention, executive functions and consciousness, can also be investigated by axonal stimulation. In this networking model of conation and cognition, brain processing is not conceived as the sum of several subfunctions, but results from the integration and potentiation of parallel-though partially overlapping-subnetworks. This hodotopical account, supported by axonal DES, improves our understanding of neuroplasticity and its limitations. The clinical implications of this paradigmatic shift from localizationism to hodotopy, in the context of brain surgery, neurology, neurorehabilitation and psychiatry, are discussed."}, {"Title": "High prevalence of sleep and mood disorders in dry eye patients: survey of 1,000 eye clinic visitors.", "Abstract": "We aimed to explore the prevalence of probable sleep and mood disorders in eye clinic visitors.\nThis was a cross-sectional study. The participants were outpatients at six eye clinics from January through March, 2014. Outpatients were invited to complete a questionnaire containing the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). A final diagnosis was made, and patients were classified into six diagnostic groups. The main outcome measures were the scores of the PSQI and HADS among the diagnostic groups.\nA total 1,000 outpatients participated, and 730 patients (mean age 59.5\u00b119.0 years; 487 females) were analyzed after exclusion of children and patients diagnosed with healthy eyes, acute injury, or unilateral pseudophakia. The mean PSQI and HADS scores across all patients were 5.3\u00b13.1 and 9.2\u00b16.2, respectively. For the diagnostic groups, the mean PSQI and HADS scores, respectively, were 5.7\u00b13.3 and 10.2\u00b16.0 for dry eye (n=247), 5.4\u00b13.2 and 9.2\u00b15.7 for bilateral cataracts (n=159), 5.3\u00b13.3 and 8.0\u00b15.3 for bilateral pseudophakia (n=99), and, 5.0\u00b13.1 and 9.8\u00b16.6 for glaucoma (n=109). Overall, 37.3% of patients were poor sleepers (PSQI \u22656), and 45.5% had possible mood disorders (HADS \u226510). Stepwise regression analysis revealed that the PSQI and HADS scores were significantly correlated with both age (P<0.05) and the presence of dry eye (P<0.05).\nThe prevalence of sleep and mood disorders was significantly higher in patients with dry eye.

One of the use is to soothe the clinical conditions caused by the use of various psychoactive substances. The paper presents and discusses the reports of quetiapine misuse, abuse, and even mental addiction, as well as symptoms similar to the so-called discontinuation syndrome, often mixed with withdrawal syndrome occurring in the course of addiction. Most reports concern males, and especially those with a history of other psychoactive substance abuse, and personality disorders, often in conflict with the law. Therefore, clinicians should be cautious when prescribing quetiapine to such patients. The article discusses potential mechanisms responsible for quetiapine abuse. This is probably related to its sedative and anxiolytic activity which results in the frequent use with stimulants.

The related biological changes, especially complications in its course and in the course of delivery, carry a risk of developing a variety of psychological problems and mental disorders. However, their treatment is challenging due to the teratogenic effects of most psychoactive drugs and specific requirements for entering different psychotherapeutic programs. Mental disorders during pregnancy are undoubtedly an important issue for both gynecology and psychiatry. There is still a discussion considering the question whether psychotherapy during pregnancy is safe, although no scientifically valid data contradicting the safety of psychotherapy during pregnancy has been published so far. Together with psychotherapy - as a treatment of choice - clinicians approve some other relatively safe treatment methods for psychiatric disorders in pregnant women. Light therapy, limited pharmacotherapy, ECT are included.

Little attention has been given, however, to deinstitutionalization before 1954. Using United States census data on discharge and readmission rates of US mental hospitals from 1935 to 1964, this article analyzes deinstitutionalization using an interrupted time-series model, with particular attention to the statistical significance of trends before and after the advent of antipsychotics. Discharge rates significantly increased in the period before antipsychotics, indicating that deinstitutionalization began before 1954, although readmissions during that same period increased at the same rate as discharges. A reasonable inference is that patients discharged in the pre-antipsychotic period were unable to live independently outside the hospital. After 1954, both discharges and readmissions increased significantly, but due to a continuing increase in admissions, no significant decrease in mental hospital populations occurred during the seven-year period after 1954. The decline began in 1961 and coincided with changes in federal policy. The fate of mental patients discharged from hospitals during this second period of deinstitutionalization is examined. The central conclusions are (1) the overall reduction in the population of mental hospitals did not coincide with the 1954 introduction of antipsychotic medications, and (2) deinstitutionalization before and after drugs has been met with inadequate community-based care."}, {"Title": "Blueprint for an Indian nobel laureate in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "There are a number of spoofs and light-hearted writings in blogs, journalistic pieces and book form (even from former Nobel Laureates), which attempt at 'understanding' the secret of getting a Nobel.

Further discussion in the paper is divided into 5 parts: (1)General qualities for a Nobel: The need to be really bright is a given; what is necessary is to be sufficiently crazy about a research topic to make it an obsession; be ready to forgo many creature comforts for long stretches of time; and after all this, be ready to accept that the Nobel may never happen, yet continue to do a type of research solely because it is intrinsically worth doing.(2)Nobel in Physiology or Medicine: Here, the key is to do fundamental/basic research to answer persistent, nagging, unanswered questions of medicine which others neglect because they are discomforting. Or, find treatments that change the whole manner a disease has been hitherto treated.(3)Nobel in Psychiatry: There are many Nobels waiting to be won, provided: (a) The branch becomes more precise; (b) Science, quantitative study and biology remain its bedrock; and (c) There is an almost obsessive preoccupation with unravelling the mysteries of the brain. One has to choose wisely where to put in efforts, e.g., fields like fundamental research into the causes of psychiatric disorders, especially schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorders. Or their definitive treatments. Or, work at the cellular or molecular level of the neuron and brain; or, the glandular or genetic level of the systems connected with psychiatric disorders; or, in brain radio imaging. If other, or allied, fields are chosen, to work with finding quantitative data and attempt to pinpoint their precise biological correlates.(4)Indian Nobel in Medicine: There is first the need to give up the colonial mindset that everything trend-setting in science comes only from the West.

For governments, to set up an autonomous Research Excellence Council to expressly and exclusively cater to promoting research excellence, with a sizeable fund to put this into practice.All these four points are summarised as four rules.(5)Indian Nobel in psychiatry: Practical suggestions are presented in the form of an 11 Point Action Plan based on 1-4 above."}, {"Title": "Changing Medical Students' Attitudes to Psychiatry through Newer Teaching Techniques.", "Abstract": "The significance of mental health in the entire health scenario has increased.

Modern parents are overly aware, concerned and anxious about their children's future. As a result children get under the pressure of comparison, competition, ambition and goal-setting. All this typically results in the vicious cycle of parental pressures, miscommunication, generation gap etc. No textbook gives clear-cut guidelines about practical aspects of parenting, which is more an art than a science.

In Japan, novel expressive forms of psychiatric phenomena such as \"modern-type depression\" and \"hikikomori\" (a syndrome of severe social withdrawal lasting for at least six months) have been reported especially among young people. Economic games such as the trust game have been utilized to evaluate real-world interpersonal relationships as a novel candidate for psychiatric evaluations. To investigate the relationship between trusting behaviors and various psychometric scales, we conducted a trust game experiment with eighty-one Japanese university students as a pilot study. Participants made a risky financial decision about whether to trust each of 40 photographed partners. Participants then answered a set of questionnaires with seven scales including the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS)-6 and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9. Consistent with previous research, male participants trusted partners more than female participants. Regression analysis revealed that LSNS-family (perceived support from family) for male participants, and item 8 of PHQ-9 (subjective agitation and/or retardation) for female participants were associated with participants' trusting behaviors. Consistent with claims by social scientists, our data suggest that, for males, support from family was negatively associated with cooperative behavior toward non-family members. Females with higher subjective agitation (and/or retardation) gave less money toward males and high attractive females, but not toward low attractive females in interpersonal relationships.

It suggests that there have been three major shifts in the ideological and intellectual orientation of the \"psy complex.\" The first period sees the dominance of the asylum in the provision of mental health care, with psychology, once it emerges in the early twentieth century, remaining a small enterprise largely operating outside the clinical arena, save for the development of psychometric technology. It is followed, between 1945 and 1980, by the rise of psychoanalytic psychiatry and the emergence of clinical psychology. Finally, the re-emergence of biological psychiatry is closely associated with two major developments: an emphasis that emerges in the late 1970s on rendering the diagnosis of psychiatric illnesses mechanical and predictable; and the long-term effects of the psychopharmacological revolution that began in the early 1950s.

Conflicting Attitudes towards Technology and Science during the Psychosurgery Controversy of the 1970s.", "Abstract": "In the 1970s a public controversy erupted over the proposed use of brain operations to curtail violent behavior. Civil libertarians, civil rights and community activists, leaders of the anti-psychiatry movement, and some U.S. Congressmen charged psychosurgeons and the National Institute of Mental Health, with furthering a political project: the suppression of dissent. Several government-sponsored investigations into psychosurgery rebutted this charge and led to an official qualified endorsement of the practice while calling attention to the need for more \"scientific\" understanding and better ethical safeguards. This paper argues that the psychosurgery debate of the 1970s was more than a power struggle between members of the public and the psychiatric establishment. The debate represented a clash between a postmodern skepticism about science and renewed focus on ultimate ends, on the one hand, and a modern faith in standards and procedures, a preoccupation with means, on the other. These diverging commitments made the dispute ultimately irresolvable."}, {"Title": "Of psychometric means: Starke R. Hathaway and the popularization of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.", "Abstract": "The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was developed at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in the 1930s and 1940s. It became a highly successful and highly controversial psychometric tool. In professional terms, psychometric tools such as the MMPI transformed psychology and psychiatry. Psychometric instruments thus readily fit into the developmental history of psychology, psychiatry, and neurology; they were a significant part of the narrative of those fields' advances in understanding, intervening, and treating people with mental illnesses. At the same time, the advent of such tools also fits into a history of those disciplines that records the rise of obsessional observational and evaluative techniques and technologies in order to facilitate patterns of social control that became typical during the Progressive Era in the United States and after. It was those patterns that also nurtured the resistance to psychometrics that emerged during the Vietnam War and after."}, {"Title": "Telomeres, early-life stress and mental illness.", "Abstract": "Telomeres are structures of tandem TTAGGG repeats that are found at the ends of chromosomes and preserve genomic DNA by serving as a disposable buffer to protect DNA termini during chromosome replication. In this process, the telomere itself shortens with each cell division and can consequently be thought of as a cellular 'clock', reflecting the age of a cell and the time until senescence. Telomere shortening and changes in the levels of telomerase, the enzyme that maintains telomeres, occur in the context of certain somatic diseases and in response to selected physical stressors. Emerging evidence indicates that telomeres shorten with exposure to psychosocial stress (including early-life stress) and perhaps in association with some psychiatric disorders. These discoveries suggest that telomere shortening might be a useful biomarker for the overall stress response of an organism to various pathogenic conditions. In this regard, telomeres and their response to both somatic and psychiatric illness could serve as a unifying stress-response biomarker that crosses the brain/body distinction that is often made in medicine. Prospective studies will help to clarify whether this biomarker has broad utility in psychiatry and medicine for the evaluation of responses to psychosocial stressors. The possibility that telomere shortening can be slowed or reversed by psychiatric and psychosocial interventions could represent an opportunity for developing novel preventative and therapeutic approaches."}, {"Title": "Then and now \u2026 HIV consultation psychiatry update.", "Abstract": "Over the last 2 decades, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) illness has transformed to a chronic disease model.

Detailed account of the models is given and quantitative and qualitative outcome data is reviewed. Rationales behind the concept include increased patient autonomy, promotion of coping skills, early help-seeking, avoidance of power struggles, establishment of an asylum function, reduced time spent in inpatient care and prevention of coercive measures. Quantitative data points toward a dramatic reduction of total time spent in inpatient care and of involuntary admissions in patients with previously high inpatient care consumption, whereas qualitative data indicates that the concept increases patient autonomy, responsibility and confidence in daily life.\nPatient-controlled admission is a promising novel approach to inpatient care in psychiatry.

To date, studies comparing serum drug levels in patients switched to generic antipsychotics in a standard clinical setting are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate if switching to generic olanzapine in patients affected by schizophrenia is associated with differences in its serum concentrations and therapeutic response.\nPreswitching and postswitching serum olanzapine concentrations were compared in schizophrenic outpatients who were switched from a chronic treatment with branded olanzapine to the same dose of its generic alternative. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was concurrently administered to assess modifications in schizophrenia symptom control.\nA total of 25 patients (13 women and 12 men, mean age 41.2 \u00b1 12.8 years) concluded the study. Mean olanzapine dose was 12.2 \u00b1 5.4 mg/d. The mean olanzapine serum concentrations decreased from 27.7 \u00b1 14.4 ng/mL during treatment with the branded formulation to 22.6 \u00b1 12.3 ng/mL after switching to the generic formulation (P < 0.01). The log-transformed ratio of generic/brand-name olanzapine serum concentration at steady state was 0.81 (90% confidence interval: 0.72-0.91). The total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores did not significantly change after switching from branded to generic formulation (49.6 \u00b1 8.3 versus 48.6 \u00b1 9.5, P = 0.777). No patient exhibited disease relapse or required dose adjustment after switching.\nSignificantly lower serum olanzapine concentrations were found after switching from branded to generic olanzapine. Although these modifications did not significantly impair schizophrenia symptoms control, it cannot be excluded that a longer exposure to lower olanzapine serum concentrations may result in relapse of schizophrenic symptoms. Generic substitution should be considered as an indication for therapeutic drug monitoring in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Time trends in incidence rates of diagnosed attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder across 16 years in a nationwide Danish registry study.", "Abstract": "To investigate time trends in incidence rates of first-time diagnosed attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a nationwide sample aged 4-65 years across 16 years and identify potential contributing factors to these time trends.\nIncidence rates of first-time diagnosed ADHD based on ICD-10 criteria in Danish psychiatric hospitals per 100,000 person years (PY) were calculated for the total population, the 2 sexes, and 4 age groups using data from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Registry and annual census data. Time trends and the role of contributing factors were analyzed and identified using joinpoint regression procedures by calculating annual percent changes for the time period 1995-2010.\nA total of 20,281 patients were diagnosed with ADHD and incidence rates increased from 7.3 to 91.2 per 100,000 PY during the study period.

There have been several theories on the nature and definition of delusions. Jaspers described them as entailing a total transformation of reality and considered primary delusions as un-understandable. When it comes to clinical practice, psychiatrists resort to criteria of falsity, incorrigibility, conviction and being out of keeping with the person's culture. All these criteria have been subject to various criticisms, some of which will be discussed in the paper. We will use the concept of epistemic injustice to explore the role of stereotypes and prejudice in the identification of delusions. We will discuss cases where patients are suffering from testimonial injustice by virtue of having a mental disorder that is so often associated with attributions of irrationality, bizarreness and incomprehensibility. Two vignettes will be presented to show that this is often the case in clinical practice. We will discuss relevant issues around the epistemology of the delusions. We think that in order to challenge the testimonial injustice, there needs to be an awareness of its possibility and thus recognition of the role of certain stereotypes in assessing these mental states. Challenging the stigma against mentally ill and adopting a holistic view of delusions can help tackle the prejudice that pre-empt the testimonial injustice."}, {"Title": "Duration of daily TV/screen watching with cardiovascular, respiratory, mental and psychiatric health: Scottish Health Survey, 2012-2013.", "Abstract": "The link of duration of TV and/or screen watching and chronic health conditions by subtypes is unclear.

This review outlines the phenomenology of auditory hallucinations, their assessment and clinical significance. Auditory hallucinations are seen in the course of acute medical disorders, often together with decreased levels of consciousness, as in febrile illness and in toxic, neurologically compromised states; they can also be a feature of episodic neurological conditions such as migraine and temporal lobe epilepsy. Auditory hallucinations are key symptoms in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenic and other psychotic states, but they can also present with depressive and anxiety disorders, and in the context of virtually every psychiatric disorder of childhood. In fact hallucinations--usually simple and transient--are common in the general child populations. Auditory hallucinations become clinically significant when they occur as part of a medical disorder or in the context of acute psychotic states and schizophrenia, when they are frequent, complex, distressing and cause impairment. The treatment of clinically relevant hallucinations is that of the primary medical or psychiatric disorder. Occasionally they require treatment in their own right with psychological treatments, and only when these have been tried and fail, a careful trial of antipsychotic medication may be appropriate."}, {"Title": "Movement disorders and psychiatry: Five new things.", "Abstract": "In this article we report recent interesting diagnostic and therapeutic advances in a diverse range of movement disorders with associated psychiatric comorbidity.

These concepts were then linked to the ICF-CY by two independent researchers using a standardized linking procedure. New concepts were extracted from the studies until saturation of identified ICF-CY categories was reached.\nSeventy-one studies were included in the final analysis and 2475 meaningful concepts contained in these studies were linked to 146 ICF-CY categories. Of these, 99 categories were considered most relevant to ASD (i.e., identified in at least 5% of the studies), of which 63 were related to Activities and Participation, 28 were related to Body functions, and 8 were related to Environmental factors. The five most frequently identified categories were basic interpersonal interactions (51%), emotional functions (49%), complex interpersonal interactions (48%), attention functions (44%), and mental functions of language (44%).\nThe broad variety of ICF-CY categories identified in this study reflects the heterogeneity of functional differences found in ASD--both with respect to disability and exceptionality--and underlines the potential value of the ICF-CY as a framework to capture an individual's functioning in all dimensions of life.

Nonetheless, a preliminary understanding is always the first step of phenomenological as well as other qualitative research methods addressing persons with psychotic experiences in their life-world. In contrast to Rashed's assertions, in order to achieve such understanding, phenomenological psychopathologists need not necessarily adopt the transcendental-phenomenological attitude, which, however, is often required if performing phenomenological philosophy. Additionally, in the course of these (non-philosophical) scientific endeavors, differences between persons with psychosis/schizophrenia and so-called normal people seem to have a methodological function and value driving the scientist in her enterprise. Yet, these differences do not extend to ethical dimensions, and therefore, do not by any means touch ethical equality."}, {"Title": "A critical perspective on second-order empathy in understanding psychopathology: phenomenology and ethics.", "Abstract": "The centenary of Karl Jaspers' General Psychopathology was recognised in 2013 with the publication of a volume of essays dedicated to his work (edited by Stanghellini and Fuchs). Leading phenomenological-psychopathologists and philosophers of psychiatry examined Jaspers notion of empathic understanding and his declaration that certain schizophrenic phenomena are 'un-understandable'. The consensus reached by the authors was that Jaspers operated with a narrow conception of phenomenology and empathy and that schizophrenic phenomena can be understood through what they variously called second-order and radical empathy. This article offers a critical examination of the second-order empathic stance along phenomenological and ethical lines. It asks: (1) Is second-order empathy (phenomenologically) possible? (2) Is the second-order empathic stance an ethically acceptable attitude towards persons diagnosed with schizophrenia? I argue that second-order empathy is an incoherent method that cannot be realised.

CBZ is known to be a potent inducer of various CYP isoenzymes of cytochrome P450, which might result in a decrease in the plasma concentration of associated treatments. We describe two cases of CBZ overdosage in adolescent inpatients (14 and 16 years). The patients were treated with risperidone associated with fluoxetine in one and with loxapine in the other case, and CBZ was introduced as a mood stabilizer. Patients presented typical clinical symptoms (fatigue, dizziness, gastrointestinal signs, blurred vision). Overdosage was confirmed by an elevated CBZ plasma concentration (17 and 15.5 mg/L, therapeutic range 4-12 mg/L). We recommend introducing CBZ very progressively in patients treated with psychotropics, particularly when it is associated to several treatments. An intensification of clinical and biological follow-up with early plasma concentration testing should allow for better treatment adjustment."}, {"Title": "The lived experience of US parents of children with autism spectrum disorders: a systematic review and meta-synthesis.", "Abstract": "Current US statistics indicate that 1 in 68 children is diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder (Centers for Disease Control (2014) Prevalence of autism spectrum disorder among children aged 8 years-autism and developmental disabilities monitoring network, 11 Sites, United States, 2010.

However, they are often undiagnosed and untreated, and their relationship to sexual dysfunction is complex. This study examines the frequency and correlates of comorbid anxiety and depression in men with ED or PE.\nThe case records of 64 men with ED or PE attending a clinic for psychosexual disorders in a general hospital psychiatry unit during the period 2010-14 were reviewed. Information on comorbid anxiety disorders and depression was extracted from these records, and their clinical and demographic associations were analyzed.\nEight (12.5%) men had comorbid depressive disorders, and fifteen (23.4%) had anxiety disorders. These disorders predated the onset of sexual dysfunction in the majority of patients. Generalized anxiety disorder was the commonest anxiety disorder. Men with comorbid depression had significantly elevated rates of suicidal ideation or behavior related to their sexual dysfunction, and were more likely to report a lack of libido. Men with pre-existing anxiety disorders were more likely to experience performance anxiety related to sex, and to have PE without comorbid ED.\nDepression and anxiety affect a substantial minority of men with sexual dysfunction. Men presenting for the evaluation of ED and PE should be carefully screened for these disorders.

Roots of the self-medication concept in psychiatry date back at least to the 1980s. Observations that rates of smokers in schizophrenic patients are multiple times the rates for regular smoking in the general population, as well as those with other disorders, proved particularly tempting for a self-medication explanation. Additional evidence came from experiments with animal models exposed to nicotine and the identification of neurobiological mechanisms suggesting self-medication with smoking is a plausible idea. More recently, results from studies comparing smoking and non-smoking schizophrenic patients have led to the questioning of the self-medication hypothesis. Closer examination of the literature points to the possibility that smoking is less beneficial on schizophrenic symptomology than generally assumed while clearly increasing the risk of cancer and other smoking-related diseases responsible for early mortality. It is a good time to examine the evidence for the self-medication concept as it relates to smoking.

Of 20 factors discussed, only three were often linked to high placebo responses: low baseline severity of symptoms, more recent trials, and unbalanced randomisation (more patients randomly assigned to drug than placebo). Randomised controlled trials in non-drug therapy have not added further predictors, and laboratory studies with psychological, brain, and genetic approaches have not been successful in identifying predictors of placebo responses.

Modeling psychiatric disorders is currently performed by targeting various key neurobehavioral clusters of phenotypic traits (domains), including affective, cognitive, social, motor and reward. Analyses of such domains and their 'smaller units' - individual endophenotypes - are critical for the study of complex brain disorders and their neural underpinnings. The spectrum nature of brain disorders and the importance of pathogenetic linkage among various disordered domains or endophenotypes have also been recognized as an important strategic direction of translational research. Here, we discuss cross-domain analyses of animal models, and focus on their value for mimicking the clinical overlap between disordered neurobehavioral domains in humans. Based on recent experimental evidence, we argue that understanding of brain pathogenesis requires modeling the clinically relevant inter-relationships between various individual endophenotypes (or their domains)."}, {"Title": "Oral mucosal diseases in anxiety and depression patients: Hospital based observational study from south India.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of different Oral Mucosal diseases in Anxiety and Depression patients.\nA hospital based observational Study was conducted in the department of Psychiatry and department of Oral Medicine and Radiology.

Given their widespread occurrence, such experiences cannot merely reflect pathological functioning. Moreover, reflecting the multi-dimensionality of schizotypy, some dimensions might be informative for healthy functioning while others less so. Here, we explored these possibilities by reviewing research that links schizotypy to favorable functioning such as subjective wellbeing, cognitive functioning (major focus on creativity), and personality correlates. This research highlights the existence of healthy people with psychotic-like traits who mainly experience positive schizotypy (but also affective features mapping onto bipolar disorder). These individuals seem to benefit from a healthy way to organize their thoughts and experiences, that is, they employ an adaptive cognitive framework to explain and integrate their unusual experiences. We conclude that, instead of focusing only on the pathological, future studies should explore the behavioral, genetic, imaging, and psychopharmacological correlates that define the healthy expression of psychotic-like traits. Such studies would inform on protective or compensatory mechanisms of psychosis-risk and could usefully inform us on the evolutionary advantages of the psychosis dimension."}, {"Title": "Time trends in lifetime incidence rates of first-time diagnosed anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa across 16 years in a Danish nationwide psychiatric registry study.", "Abstract": "To study recent time trends in the incidence of diagnosed anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) based on nationwide psychiatric register data.\nThe Danish Psychiatric Central Research Registry was used to identify the incidence of diagnosed cases with AN and BN at the ages of 4-65 years from 1995 to 2010.

Three embedding entropy measurements (approximate entropy, sample entropy, permutation entropy (PermEn)) are used to estimate single channel EEG complexity for 19-channel eyes closed cortical measurements. Mean coherence and mutual information are examined to measure the level of interhemispheric dependency in frequency and statistical domain, respectively for eight distinct electrode pairs placed on the scalp with respect to the international 10-20 electrode placement system. All methods are applied to short EEG segments of 2 s. The classification performance is measured 20 times with different 2-fold cross-validation data for both single channel complexity features (19 features) and interhemispheric dependency features (eight features). The highest classification accuracy of 85 \u00b15.2% is provided by PermEn at prefrontal regions of the brain. Even if the classification success do not provided by other methods as high as PermEn, the clear differences between patients and controls at prefrontal regions can also be obtained by using other methods except coherence.

The goal of the present paper was to examine the concept of psychopathology from a network perspective, combining complementary top-down and bottom-up approaches using momentary assessment techniques.\nA pooled Experience Sampling Method (ESM) dataset of three groups (individuals with a diagnosis of depression, psychotic disorder or no diagnosis) was used (pooled N = 599). The top-down approach explored the network structure of mental states across different diagnostic categories. For this purpose, networks of five momentary mental states ('cheerful', 'content', 'down', 'insecure' and 'suspicious') were compared between the three groups. The complementary bottom-up approach used principal component analysis to explore whether empirically derived network structures yield meaningful higher order clusters.\nIndividuals with a clinical diagnosis had more strongly connected moment-to-moment network structures, especially the depressed group. This group also showed more interconnections specifically between positive and negative mental states than the psychotic group. In the bottom-up approach, all possible connections between mental states were clustered into seven main components that together captured the main characteristics of the network dynamics.\nOur combination of (i) comparing network structure of mental states across three diagnostically different groups and (ii) searching for trans-diagnostic network components across all pooled individuals showed that these two approaches yield different, complementary perspectives in the field of psychopathology.

In the absence of such guidance, recovery-oriented multifocal treatment planning has been imported into forensic mental health systems from community psychiatric settings, despite the fact that conditions of admission and discharge are vastly different for forensic psychiatry inpatients. We propose that instead of focusing on recovery, forensic treatment planning should prioritize forensic outcomes, such as restoration of trial competence or mitigation of violence risk, as the first steps in a continuum of care that eventually leads to the patient's ability to resolve forensic issues and return to the community for recovery-oriented care. Here we offer a model for treatment planning in the forensic setting."}, {"Title": "What can qualitative studies reveal about recruitment into psychiatry?", "Abstract": "Studies examining recruitment problems in psychiatry have been mostly quantitative and limited in their ability to elucidate perceptions and day-to-day influences that may affect recruitment. This review aimed to identify factors on recruitment into psychiatry by appraising available qualitative studies.\nThe authors searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase using Health Database Advanced Search tool on NHS Evidence. Inclusion criteria were qualitative studies and English-language published papers. The authors appraised 10 qualitative studies and identified common themes.\nThe ten qualitative studies used thematic analysis, phenomenology, and narrative study methods. Populations studied were medical students, foundation doctors, residents/trainees, psychiatrists, and undergraduate psychiatry teachers from the USA, UK, Australia, Canada, and Ghana. The studies highlighted importance of role models, mentorship, and supervision in improving recruitment. Additional factors included stigmatization in mental illness, satisfaction rates, interactive nature, and academic interest within psychiatry.\nThe appraised studies were limited in their number and methodology. More qualitative studies are needed to inform policy on recruitment into psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Team cohesiveness, team size and team performance in team-based learning teams.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships among variables associated with teams in team-based learning (TBL) settings and team outcomes.\nWe administered the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Psychiatry Subject Test first to individuals and then to teams of Year three students at four medical schools that used TBL in their psychiatry core clerkships. Team cohesion was analysed using the Team Performance Scale (TPS). Bivariate correlation and linear regression analysis were used to analyse the relationships among team-level variables (mean individual TPS scores for each team, mean individual NBME scores of teams, team size, rotation and gender make-up) and team NBME test scores. A hierarchical linear model was used to test the effects of individual TPS and individual NBME test scores within each team, as well as the effects of the team-level variables of team size, team rotation and gender on team NBME test scores. Individual NBME test and TPS scores were nested within teams and treated as subsampling units.\nIndividual NBME test scores and individual TPS scores were positively and statistically significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) associated with team NBME test scores, when team rotation, team size and gender make-up were controlled for. Higher team NBME test scores were associated with teams rotating later in the year and larger teams (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Gender make-up was not significantly associated.\nThe results of an NBME Psychiatry Subject Test administered to TBL teams at four medical schools suggest that larger teams on later rotations score higher on a team NBME test. Individual NBME test scores and team cohesion were positively and significantly associated with team NBME test scores. These results suggest the need for additional studies focusing on team outcomes, team cohesion, team size, rotation and other factors as they relate to the effective and efficient performance of TBL teams in health science education."}, {"Title": "[New developments in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "In this review of recent therapeutic developments in psychiatry, we will report on three domains where new strategies have been proposed.

They are activated by abnormal physiological parameters, symptoms or clinical concern, and are believed to decrease hospital mortality rates. We evaluated the reasons for activation and the outcome of rapid response interventions in a 222-bed psychiatric hospital in New York City using data obtained at the time of all activations from January through November, 2012. The primary outcome was the admission rate to a medical or surgical unit for each of the main reasons for activation. The 169 activations were initiated by nursing staff (78.7 %) and psychiatrists (13 %) for acute changes in condition (64.5 %), abnormal physiological parameters (27.2 %) and non-specified concern (8.3 %). The most common reasons for activation were chest pain (14.2 %), fluctuating level of consciousness (9.5 %), hypertension (9.5 %), syncope or fall (8.9 %), hypotension (8.3 %), dyspnea (7.7 %) and seizures (5.9 %). The rapid response team transferred 127 (75.2 %) patients to the Emergency Department and 46 (27.2 %) were admitted to a medical or surgical unit. The admission rates were statistically similar for acute changes in condition, abnormal physiological parameters, and clinicians' concern. In conclusion, a majority of rapid response activations in a self-standing psychiatric hospital were initiated by nursing staff for changes in condition, rather than for policy-specified abnormal physiological parameters. The findings suggest that a rapid response system may empower psychiatric nurses to use their clinical skills to identify patients requiring urgent transfer to a general hospital."}, {"Title": "Innovative training with virtual patients in transcultural psychiatry: the impact on resident psychiatrists' confidence.", "Abstract": "Virtual patients are now widely accepted as efficient and safe training tools in medical education, but very little is known about their implementation in psychiatry, especially in transcultural clinical care of traumatized refugee patients.\nThis study aimed at assessing the impact of training with a virtual patient on confidence in providing clinical care for traumatized refugee patients.\nThe authors developed an educational tool based on virtual patient methodology portraying the case of \"Mrs. K\", a traumatized refugee woman with symptoms of PTSD and depression.

A targeted pharmacotherapy is complicated by the underlying cognitive impairment and physical comorbidities. The current review focusses on recent evidence on the use of antidepressives and antipsychotics for psychotic disturbances, agitation and depression in dementia and analyzes currently published randomized controlled clinical trials and meta-analyses. The evidence on the use of antipsychotics for different indications favors risperidone, with lower evidence levels for quetiapine and aripiprazole, whereas haloperidol should be avoided. Increased mortality and the risk of cerebrovascular events due to antipsychotics are of major concern. With respect to antidepressives, the benefit of antidepressive pharmacotherapy in dementia is critically discussed because of limited efficacy and increased side effects; however, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), such as citalopram and sertraline have demonstrated efficacy on neuropsychiatric behavioral symptoms in general.

Multiple myths and pitfalls may be encountered during capacity evaluations; many of these can be avoided by proper education and training. We discuss the case of a 71-year-old man who presented to the emergency department by ambulance and was refusing non-emergent neurosurgery after a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He was evaluated for medical decision-making capacity, specifically on whether he had the capacity to refuse neurosurgery and accept intravenous antibiotic treatment.

However, epidemiological and correlational studies of PLEs showed mixed findings - it is observed that different studies use a wide variety of definitions of PLEs, as well as different assessment tools that are designed to capture such described experiences. The differences in definitions and assessment tools adopted could contribute to the discrepancy of findings. The current review aims to examine the definitions and assessment tools adopted in the studies of PLEs.\nLiterature search was conducted between October 2013 and February 2014 using three search engines: Medline, Web of Science and PubMed.\nA total of 76 papers met the selection criteria and were included in the current review. It is found that the majority of papers reviewed defined PLEs quantitatively using assessment tools and do not have a specific phenomenological definition, whereas assessment tools adopted have a wide variety. Furthermore, phenomenological studies of PLEs were rare.\nThe variations in definitions and assessment tools of PLEs might contribute to mixed findings in researches. Reaching to a consensus through the study of phenomenology of PLEs is essential to further advancement of the research in this area."}, {"Title": "What Do Medical Students Perceive as Meaningful in the Psychiatry Clerkship Learning Environment? A Content Analysis of Critical Incident Narratives.", "Abstract": "In order to better understand the professional development of medical students during their psychiatry clerkship, this study identifies common themes and characteristics of students' critical incident narratives which are designed to capture a recount of clerkship experiences they perceived as meaningful.\nA total of 205 narratives submitted by psychiatry clerkship students in 2010-2011 were subjected to a thematic analysis using a methodological approach and adaptation of categories derived from prior similar research. Descriptive content analysis was also carried out to assess the valence of the narrative content, characters involved, and whether there was evidence that the experience changed students' perspectives in some way.\nNarratives contained a variety of positive (19%) and negative content (24%) and many contained a hybrid of both (57%). The most common theme (29%) concerned issues of respect and disrespect in patient, clinical, and coworker interactions. In general, the majority (68%) of students' meaningful experience narratives reflected a change in their perspective (e.g., I learned that...). Narratives containing positive and hybrid content were associated with a change in students' perspective (\u03c7(2)\u2009=\u200910.61, df\u2009=\u20092, p\u2009<\u20090.005).\nMedical students are keenly aware of the learning environment.

Beginning in the 1980s, the Air Force started collaborating with University partners to create hybrid training programs, civilian-military psychiatry residencies. These mergers provide stability for Air Force psychiatry training in the face of increased operational missions and uncertain military recruiting. As a result of these combined programs, Air Force psychiatry residents gain access to a broader range of civilian clinical experience and expertise while maintaining a focus on distinctive military requirements. The combining of programs opens up options for academic activities which may not have otherwise existed. Both military and civilian residents benefit from the occupational psychiatry experiences available within military clinical sites. These programs give civilian residents a chance to assist active duty members and their families and provide insight into the military \"lifecycle.\" These collaborations benefit the universities by providing access to a larger pool of residents and faculty. The synthesis of the military and civilian programs raises some ongoing obstacles such as civilian residents' ability to gain access to military resources. The programs must also accommodate separate mechanisms for selecting residents (the National Residency Matching Program versus the Joint Selection Board for Graduate Medical Education). Military residents must also comply with military standards and requirements while maintaining the universities' standards of conduct and professionalism.

In this context, it is important to understand the nuances of the provision of expert witness testimony. There have been several efforts to examine gender bias across legal and medical systems. Despite these reviews, little is known about how men and women differ or are similar with regard to performing expert witness functions. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine whether the testimony experiences of psychiatry and psychology experts vary by gender. Differences across certain domains, such as the sense of never experiencing anxiety and the sense of one's impact on case outcome were seen across genders. Few other gender-based differences in the experience of providing expert witness testimony were seen. Although the findings of this study raise further questions, they highlight some of the important subtleties noted in forensic practice and the work of the expert witness. In future studies, researchers should continue to explore these findings on the influence of gender and expand to consider culture and race as additional factors in the experience of expert witness testimony.

Intersectionality was investigated by including a material deprivation quintile by immigrant status (immigrant vs long-term resident) interaction.\nRecent immigrants in urban Ontario were more likely than long-term residents to live in most deprived quintiles (immigrants--males: 22.8%, females: 22.3%; long-term residents--both sexes: 13.1%, p<0.001). Living in more deprived circumstances was associated with greater use of mental health services, but increases were smaller for immigrants than for long-term residents. Immigrants used less mental health services than long-term residents.\nThis study adds to existing research by suggesting that immigrant status and deprivation have a combined effect on recent immigrants' care use for non-psychotic mental health disorders. In settings where immigrants are over-represented in deprived areas, policymakers focused on increasing immigrants' access of mental health services should broadly address the influence of structural and cultural factors beyond the disadvantage."}, {"Title": "[The treatment needs of migrant children according to child and adolescent psychiatrists from medical clinics and in private practice].", "Abstract": "How does the German child and adolescent psychiatry system respond to the increasing number of migrant children and adolescents?\nSenior doctors from German child and adolescent psychiatric hospitals (Association of Medical Hospital Directors in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy in Germany, BAG) completed a specially constructed questionnaire about the treatment needs of migrant children, while a \u00abrandom, representative\u00bb sample of child and adolescent psychiatrists in private practice (German Professional Association for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, BKJPP) was administered a slightly modified version.\nThe 100 psychiatrists in private practice represented only about one-eighth of their group, whereas the 55 medical directors comprised a representative sample.

It is however essential to know how to pool results in order to understand the behavior of the drug in all the situations likely to be encountered in clinical practice. The exploitation of these data is now carried out through pharmacometric analyzes which aim at quantifying the exposure and the response of a drug over time. These methods (named \"population approach\") are based on non-linear mixed effects model and therefore, on the identification of a mathematical model. A first step is to model the variations in concentrations over time by integrating the physio-pathological characteristics of the patients. At this stage, the Bayesian analysis is essential to identify and select the factors of interindividual variability. This pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling allows us to obtain the prescribed dose for each patient, but also their exposure. The second step consists in defining the relationship between exposure and effect: pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling. In psychiatry, the response can be the receptors' occupancy rate or the evolution of a clinical score (BPRS, PANSS\u2026) over time. The final PK-PD model defines the target exposure, that is to say, the concentration values required to achieve maximum effect on the score studied without risking over-exposure. Ultimately, a Monte Carlo simulation will be conducted which will test the expected response for different doses and will facilitate a rational choice in dosage. Assessing the process behind the transition from an oral to a long-acting injectable form of an active ingredient such as aripiprazole can be done by following the same protocol. A 10- to 30-mg per day therapeutic range has thus been identified. The model incorporates all the identified factors of variability of aripiprazole (drug interactions and genetic polymorphism of the P450 2D6 cytochrome) and showed that with an injectable sustained release form, a monthly dose of 400mg would allow 90% of patients to gain exposure in the therapeutic range.

The majority of the data available are survey data from commercial entities. These data show trends toward increasing demand for psychiatry along with increasing salaries and indicate the utilization of telepsychiatry and locum tenens telepsychiatry is increasing. The published academic data that are available show that although locum tenens psychiatry is slightly inferior to routine psychiatric care, telepsychiatry is generally equivalent to face-to-face care.\nOne can anticipate that as the national shortage of psychiatrists is expected to accelerate, use of both locum tenens and telepsychiatry may also continue to increase. Telepsychiatry offers several possible advantages, including lower cost, longer-term services, quality of care, and models that can extend psychiatric services.

However, there is evidence that psychopathy is best described by a set of relatively independent personality dimensions, that is, callous-unemotional, grandiose-manipulative, and impulsive-irresponsible traits, which can be reliably detected in juveniles, allowing investigation of the neural mechanisms leading to psychopathy. Furthermore, complex psychiatric disorders like psychopathy are increasingly being conceptualized as disorders of brain networks. The intrinsic organization of the brain in such networks is reflected by coherent fluctuations in resting state networks (RSNs), but these have not been studied in sufficient detail in relation to juvenile psychopathic traits yet. The current study investigated the distinct associations of juvenile psychopathic traits dimensions with RSN connectivity. Resting-state functional MRI and independent component analysis were used to assess RSN connectivity in a large sample of adolescents (n = 130, mean age 17.8 years) from a childhood arrestee cohort. Associations between scores on each of the three psychopathic traits dimensions and connectivity within and between relevant RSNs were investigated. Callous-unemotional traits were related to aberrant connectivity patterns of the default mode network, which has been implicated in self-referential and moral processes. Impulsive-irresponsible traits were associated with altered connectivity patterns in the frontoparietal cognitive control networks. Grandiose-manipulative traits were not associated with altered connectivity patterns. These findings confirm the association between psychopathic traits and brain network connectivity, and considerably add to emerging evidence supporting neurobiological heterogeneity in the processes leading to psychopathy."}, {"Title": "Intertwining Psychiatry Residency Training and Ethics in the College Setting.", "Abstract": "An ethical responsibility exists, currently unaddressed, for mandated psychiatry residency training with college student populations.

Elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying AH in schizophrenia may offer insight into the pathophysiology associated with AH more broadly across multiple neuropsychiatric disease conditions. In this paper, we address the problem of classifying schizophrenia patients with and without a history of AH, and healthy control (HC) subjects. To this end, we performed feature extraction from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data and applied machine learning classifiers, testing two kinds of neuroimaging features: (a) functional connectivity (FC) measures computed by lattice auto-associative memories (LAAM), and (b) local activity (LA) measures, including regional homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF). We show that it is possible to perform classification within each pair of subject groups with high accuracy. Discrimination between patients with and without lifetime AH was highest, while discrimination between schizophrenia patients and HC participants was worst, suggesting that classification according to the symptom dimension of AH may be more valid than discrimination on the basis of traditional diagnostic categories. FC measures seeded in right Heschl's gyrus (RHG) consistently showed stronger discriminative power than those seeded in left Heschl's gyrus (LHG), a finding that appears to support AH models focusing on right hemisphere abnormalities. The cortical brain localizations derived from the features with strong classification performance are consistent with proposed AH models, and include left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), parahippocampal gyri, the cingulate cortex, as well as several temporal and prefrontal cortical brain regions. Overall, the observed findings suggest that computational intelligence approaches can provide robust tools for uncovering subtleties in complex neuroimaging data, and have the potential to advance the search for more neuroscience-based criteria for classifying mental illness in psychiatry research."}, {"Title": "Age, sex and personality in early cannabis use.", "Abstract": "Previous studies analysing personality and cannabis use in adult samples suggest that cannabis users show significant higher levels of impulsivity, sensation seeking and schizotypy.

Postoperative patients were older p=0.001 (OR=1.120, CI 1.082-1.159) with acutestress: (OR=0.735, CI 0.650-0.910) and showed neuroticism (OR=-0.660, CI 0.575-0.715). Discriminative function confirms the differences between alcohol and surgical groups of delirium patients: Canonical Fcn: r=0.771; Wilkin's lambda (\u03bbnj)=0.773 Student's test=57.551 and significance p=0.001; OR=0.760, CI 0.550-0.870.\nDelirium lasts longer in alcohol group with higher disalienation, depression of cognitive functions with organic lesions of cerebral functions. In surgical patients, delirium is the consequence of older age, acute stress, multi-morbidity, with neuroticism, vegetative disorders (HDRS) and temporary lesion on MMSE test. Delirium state in both groups requires intensive care and multidisciplinary work."}, {"Title": "Beyond childhood: psychiatric comorbidities and social background of adults with Asperger syndrome.", "Abstract": "Over the past few years, our knowledge about Asperger syndrome (AS) has increased enormously. Although it used to be a syndrome mainly encountered in childhood and adolescent psychiatry, it is now increasingly recognized in adult psychiatry. Nevertheless, little is known about psychiatric comorbidities and life course of adults with AS. The current study aimed to gain an insight into comorbidities and the development of the social situation of adults with AS.\nWe investigated psychiatric comorbidities, psychiatric history, professional background, partnerships, and children in 50 adults with AS (34 men and 16 women) over a broad age range (20-62 years).\nSeventy percent of adults with AS had at least one psychiatric comorbiditiy. Most frequent comorbidities were depression and anxiety disorders. Obsessive-compulsive disorder and alcohol abuse/dependence were also observed. Many adults had previously been treated with psychopharmacological or psychotherapeutic interventions. Although most adults had a high-level school leaving certificate and had gone on to complete training/university studies, less than half were currently in employment. Fourteen adults were living in a partnership and 10 had children.\nAdults with AS often have psychiatric comorbidities, indicating lower levels of mental health. Additionally, they seem to have severe limitations concerning professional success, despite having a good school education. Their family situation is also impaired with regard to starting a family. These considerable limitations in the life of adults with AS may help to understand their specific problems, and emphasize the importance of developing specific treatments for improving their mental health and social integration."}, {"Title": "Unifying treatments for depression: an application of the Free Energy Principle.", "Abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder is a debilitating and increasingly prevalent psychiatric condition (Compton et al., 2006; Andersen et al., 2011). At present, its primary treatments are antidepressant medications and psychotherapy. Curiously, although the pharmacological effects of antidepressants manifest within hours, remission of clinical symptoms takes a number of weeks-if at all. Independently, support has grown for an idea-proposed as early as Helmholtz (von Helmholtz, 1924)-that the brain is a prediction machine, holding generative models for the purpose of inferring causes of sensory information (Dayan et al., 1995; Rao and Ballard, 1999; Knill and Pouget, 2004; Friston et al., 2006; Friston, 2010). If the brain does indeed represent a collection of beliefs about the causal structure of the world, then the depressed phenotype may emerge from a collection of depressive beliefs. These beliefs are modified gradually through successive combinations of expectations with observations. As a result, phenotypic remission ought to take some time as the brain's relevant statistical structures become less pessimistic."}, {"Title": "Korean Medication Algorithm Project for Bipolar Disorder: third revision.", "Abstract": "To constitute the third revision of the guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder issued by the Korean Medication Algorithm Project for Bipolar Disorder (KMAP-BP 2014).\nA 56-item questionnaire was used to obtain the consensus of experts regarding pharmacological treatment strategies for the various phases of bipolar disorder and for special populations. The review committee included 110 Korean psychiatrists and 38 experts for child and adolescent psychiatry. Of the committee members, 64 general psychiatrists and 23 child and adolescent psychiatrists responded to the survey.\nThe treatment of choice (TOC) for euphoric, mixed, and psychotic mania was the combination of a mood stabilizer (MS) and an atypical antipsychotic (AAP); the TOC for acute mild depression was monotherapy with MS or AAP; and the TOC for moderate or severe depression was MS plus AAP/antidepressant. The first-line maintenance treatment following mania or depression was MS monotherapy or MS plus AAP; the first-line treatment after mania was AAP monotherapy; and the first-line treatment after depression was lamotrigine (LTG) monotherapy, LTG plus MS/AAP, or MS plus AAP plus LTG. The first-line treatment strategy for mania in children and adolescents was MS plus AAP or AAP monotherapy. For geriatric bipolar patients, the TOC for mania was AAP/MS monotherapy, and the TOC for depression was AAP plus MS or AAP monotherapy.\nThe expert consensus in the KMAP-BP 2014 differed from that in previous publications; most notably, the preference for AAP was increased in the treatment of acute mania, depression, and maintenance treatment. There was increased expert preference for the use of AAP and LTG.

The authors describe how the combination of mandated coverage for substance abuse services and expanding treatment needs means that more physicians, regardless of their patient populations, will be faced with addressing the problem of substance use. The authors review the literature on substance abuse training in medical schools, which indicates insufficient exposure to this topic. The authors describe how current substance abuse training at medical schools is focused on transmitting scientific knowledge with relatively little education or training in attitudes and skills central to effective prevention and treatment. Given the gap between clinical need and physician education, the authors suggest several strategies for medical schools to increase training in substance abuse knowledge, attitudes, and skills, which will enhance the practice of evidence-based care. The authors posit that medical curricular reform, combined with initiatives to change clinical culture around substance abuse, will translate into improved rates of screening, shorter overall length of treatment, effective referrals for continued treatment, and increased access to care for individuals who use substances and so reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with substance use."}, {"Title": "Teaching Cultural Competence to Psychiatry Residents: Seven Core Concepts and Their Implications for Therapeutic Technique.", "Abstract": "The authors describe the Tulane Model for teaching cultural competence to psychiatry residents in order to outline an innovative approach to curricula development in academic psychiatry.

I do this by investigating the cultural sensibilities of a particular generation, the self-identified 1980s generation, and the ways they situate what is perceived as d\u00e9pr\u00e9shen in social anomie and the memories of the Iran-Iraq war. I argue that psychiatrization of psychological distress in Iran was not simply a de-politicizing hegemonic biomedical discourse, but that the contemporary Iranian discourses of psychological pathology and social loss evolved in public, hand-in-hand, through the medicalization of post-war loss. Psychiatric subjectivity describes conditions where individuals internalize psychiatry as a mode of thinking, and performatively articulate not only their desires, hopes, and anxieties, but also historical losses as embodied in individual and collective brains. I underscore my interlocutors' simultaneous historicization and medicalization of their d\u00e9pr\u00e9shen, arguing that psychiatrically medicalized individuals are performative actors in the discursive formation of both biomedical and social truth.

Data on demographics, clinical outcomes and from HONOS-Secure/HONOS and HCR-20 assessments were prospectively collected. Psychiatric diagnoses were recorded using ICD-10 criteria. Data on quality of life from WHO-QoL-BREF surveys were analysed. There was a high proportion of ethnic minorities (57.8%), high rates of childhood and adult abuse and low socioeconomic status. 62.2% of the patients had schizophrenia, 57.8% had multiple diagnoses. The median length of stay at discharge was 465.5 days. There were statistically significant reductions in rates of self-harm and HoNOS-Secure/HoNOS and HCR-20 scores following intervention. Scores on WHO-QoL-BREF compared favourably to a large-scale sample with mental health difficulties. Many characteristics of this sample were comparable to samples from similar populations.

Simply this is a circadian phase preference of a person. While some of the people are morning active (so called larks) others are more active at nights (The owls). The study of circadian rhythms, known as chronobiology, is all about the metabolic and psychiatric differences between people who have different chronotypes. A few tests are used to determine chronotypes. The CCTQ (Children's Chronotype Questionnaire) is a parent-report, 27-item mixed format questionnaire measuring chronotype of children in multiple domains : the midsleep point on free days (MSF), a morningness/eveningness scale(M/E) score, and a five-point chronotype (CT) score. The aim of this study is adapting Children's Chronotype Questionnaire (CCTQ) into Turkish language and validating the instrument in Turkish population.\n101 children aged nine through eighteen constitude the sample of the study. The sample was composed of clinical (n=51) and community groups (n=50). CCTQ and Morningness Eveningness Scale for Children (MESC) questionnaires were applied to children and parents, then the CCTQ and MESC scores were compared to examine the validity of CCTQ.\nThe internal consistency and external validity of the Turkish CCTQ was sufficient to compare MESC-Turkish. As a result of this research carried out in accordance with methodological research principles, correlation between the M/E scores of CCTQ and MESC was significant.\nThe Turkish version of CCTQ has been found to be valid and reliable in Turkish children."}, {"Title": "Response to clozapine in a clinically identifiable subtype of schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Genetic testing in psychiatry promises to improve patient care through advances in personalised medicine. However, there are few clinically relevant examples.\nTo determine whether patients with a well-established genetic subtype of schizophrenia show a different response profile to the antipsychotic clozapine than those with idiopathic schizophrenia.\nWe retrospectively studied the long-term safety and efficacy of clozapine in 40 adults with schizophrenia, half with a 22q11.2 deletion (22q11.2DS group) and half matched for age and clinical severity but molecularly confirmed to have no pathogenic copy number variant (idiopathic group).\nBoth groups showed similar clinical improvement and significant reductions in hospitalisations, achieved at a lower median dose for those in the 22q11.2DS group. Most common side-effects were similarly prevalent between the two groups, however, half of the 22q11.2DS group experienced at least one rare serious adverse event compared with none of the idiopathic group. Many were successfully retried on clozapine.\nIndividuals with 22q11.2DS-schizophrenia respond as well to clozapine treatment as those with other forms of schizophrenia, but may represent a disproportionate number of those with serious adverse events, primarily seizures. Lower doses and prophylactic (for example anticonvulsant) management strategies can help ameliorate side-effect risks.

Recent studies suggest that negative attitudes toward transgender individuals are prevalent and measurable within the general population. The Genderism and Transphobia scale (GTS) measures anti-transgender feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. The purpose of this study was to use the GTS to conduct an investigation of psychiatrists' attitudes toward transgender individuals.\nA cross-sectional survey of n\u2009=\u2009142 faculty members and residents from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Manitoba was conducted. Respondents completed an online survey consisting of demographic questions and the GTS. Responses were analyzed descriptively and compared to previously published data on the GTS.\nThere was a trend for psychiatrists and psychiatry residents within this sample to endorse less negative attitudes toward transgender people compared to other published data using a sample of undergraduate students. Descriptive analyses suggest that psychiatrists' and psychiatry residents' GTS scores may be related to gender identity, political ideology, religiosity, and levels of both professional and personal contact.\nThese data evoke optimism regarding psychiatrists' and psychiatry residents' attitudes toward transgender individuals. Additional larger-scale studies comparing this medical specialty group with other specialty groups will further elucidate factors that modify physician attitudes toward this patient population. These findings may contribute to the development of educational strategies to ensure that the transgender population receives medical treatment without stigma or attitudinal compromise."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry's Next Generation: Teaching College Students About Mental Health.", "Abstract": "The authors describe an integrated area of study for undergraduate college students that targets an increase in knowledge of mental health issues in children, adolescents, and emerging adults; encourages mental health service utilization on college campuses; and exposes young minds to the possibilities of working with children and adolescents in the mental health field.\nAn overview of the program is provided, including the resources required to oversee and manage the program, student requirements, a description of the role that clinicians and researchers play as the program faculty, and an explanation of the tuition model.\nThe program currently includes 40 courses with an annual enrollment of over 3000 students, resulting in departmental revenues that currently exceed $11 million per year.

The first cognitive remediation programs were developed and validated for adults with schizophrenia and were shown to have a positive impact on executive functions as well as on quality of life. In children and adolescents, researchers emphasized the existence of executive dysfunction in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder, and eating disorders. For these disorders, neuropsychological studies suggest that memory, planning, attention and mental flexibility are impaired. Despite the paucity of studies on cognitive remediation (CR) in children, preliminary results have suggested, as in adults with schizophrenia, good compliance and optimization of executive functioning. Consequently, programs dedicated to young subjects were developed in English-speaking countries, and the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of Sainte Anne Hospital (Paris) developed a new CR program for children with attention deficit disorder, academic problems, or eating disorders. These programs complete the field of CRT proposed by Sainte Anne Hospital's Remediation and Psychosocial Rehabilitation Reference Center, initially designed for adults with schizophrenia. Our team used and adapted validated tools such as Delahunty and Wykes's CRT program (translated and validated in French by Amado and Franck) and Lindvall and Lask's CRT Resource Pack. One program was developed for an adolescent with anorexia nervosa and applied to the subject and her family, but the purpose of this paper is to present a CR approach for children with attention deficit disorder or academic disorder, a 6-month program based on paper-pencil tasks and board and card games. The team was trained in different kinds of cognitive remediation, and the program was applied by a clinical nurse with the supervision of a child and adolescent psychiatrist and the department's neuropsychologists. Paper-pencil tasks were adapted from the CRT program for adults; the card and board games used were geometric figures, illusions, Rush Hour(\u00ae), Set(\u00ae), Jungle Speed(\u00ae), Color Addict(\u00ae), etc. These games are available in stores and the program can be applied at home, which helps families set aside their preoccupations with their child's academic performance. Diagnostic and neuropsychological evaluations were done before the beginning of the therapy and repeated at the end of the 6-month program. This program does not ignore the metapsychological impact of the therapy, and work on self-esteem is also done. The presence of the therapist is necessary, which seems better than a computer program, which cannot encourage the young subject in the same personalized and empathetic way. We therefore conducted the first clinical feasibility trial of cognitive remediation in young subjects and present a clinical case of a 6-year-old boy with attention deficit disorder and academic disorder. The results of neuropsychological evaluations before and after therapy suggest improvement in executive functions and better self-esteem. Satisfaction for the boy and his family was high. Even if these results need to be replicated, cognitive remediation appears to be a new therapeutic tool, complementary to classical approaches used in childhood psychiatric disorders. The Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry will submit this program to a research program conducted by the National Health Department to study the impact of this approach in a controlled study."}, {"Title": "Cost-effectiveness of intensive home treatment enhanced by inpatient treatment elements in child and adolescent psychiatry in Germany: A randomised trial.", "Abstract": "Admission rate to child and adolescent mental health inpatient units in Germany is high (54,467 admissions in 2013), resources for providing necessary beds are scarce. Alternative pathways to care are needed. Objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of inpatient treatment versus Hot-BITs-treatment (Hometreatment brings inpatient-treatment outside), a new supported discharge service offering an early discharge followed by 12 weeks of intensive support.\nOf 164 consecutively recruited children and adolescents, living within families and being in need of inpatient mental health care, 100 patients consented to participate and were randomised via a computer-list into intervention (n=54) and control groups (n=46). Follow-up data were available for 76 patients. Primary outcome was cost-effectiveness. Effectiveness was gathered by therapist-ratings on the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) at baseline (T1), treatment completion (T2) and an 8-month-follow-up (T3). Cost of service use (health care costs and non-health care costs) was calculated on an intention-to-treat basis at T2 and T3.\nSignificant treatment effects were observed for both groups between T1/T2 and T1/T3 (P<0.001). The Hot-BITs treatment, however, was associated with significantly lower costs at T2 (difference: -6900.47\u20ac, P=0.013) and T3 (difference: -8584.10\u20ac, P=0.007). Bootstrap cost-effectiveness ratio indicated that Hot-BITs was less costly and tended to be more effective at T2 and T3.\nHot-BITs may be a feasible cost-effective alternative to long inpatient stays in child and adolescent psychiatry.

The majority of the participants (44.0%) reported being moderately comfortable with managing delirium prior to the usage of the application, but this changed after the implementation of the application, with 39.0% reporting being very confident and 44.0% being extremely confident about managing delirium after using the application. 69.0% of the participants also perceived the smartphone application to be of use to their clinical care for delirious patients.\nThis study is one of the first to demonstrate the potential usage of smartphone innovations in delirium education. The current study demonstrated the added feasibility of smartphone applications, and demonstrated that users perceived that they are more abled with managing delirium after the usage of the smartphone application."}, {"Title": "Neurosyphilis with psychotic symptoms and Parkinsonism in a young girl.", "Abstract": "A 15-year-old girl with neurosyphilis was misdiagnosed as having viral encephalitis with psychotic symptoms and Parkinsonism. We found that she was experiencing visual hallucinations, persecutory delusions, flattening of affect, poorness of thought, tremors, four-limb rigidity, and restlessness, and she was unable to communicate with others. The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory serum test and further lumbar puncture enabled us to diagnose her with neurosyphilis. After antibiotic treatment, her psychotic symptoms and Parkinsonism were relieved. From this case, we believe that it is important to keep organic psychosis in mind during the diagnostic workup, and we argue that routine syphilis screening is necessary in psychiatry clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Acute loss of vision in a young woman: a case report on psychogenic blindness.", "Abstract": "Acute loss of vision needs urgent attention and treatment. We report on a young Ethiopian woman who experienced acute bilateral blindness. In the presence of normal ophthalmological findings psychogenic blindness has to be considered.\nA 21 years old woman was admitted to the psychiatry clinic at Jimma University specialized Hospital, Jimma, South West Ethiopia. She had not been able to see for a few days. Ophthalmological and neurological examinations showed normal findings. No severe psychopathology was found. Stressful life events had preceded the appearance of the symptoms. An attitude of accepting the perspective of the patient of a seemingly organic disease is a precondition for a successful intervention. Treatment aimed at a gradual return to normal functioning. The patient regained her sight and fully recovered. The final psychiatric diagnosis was psychogenic blindness.\nThe psychosocial intervention was successful and encouraging for the patient and clinicians."}, {"Title": "On the significance of electroconvulsive therapy in the treatment of severe mental diseases.", "Abstract": "Quite a few patients with severe mental diseases do not respond sufficiently to psychopharmacology and psychotherapy. For some of these, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) offers a promising alternative. Erroneously, the method is being perceived as old fashioned by the lay public, but also by many doctors. Therefore, this overview aims at all colleagues who in their role as multipliers, referring physicians or ECT specialists can reduce the likelihood of mental disease to become chronic.\nDuring the last decades, numerous international medical societies including the Austrian and the German Association for Psychiatry (\u00d6GPP and DGPPN) have pointed to the importance of ECT as a modern medical intervention. Our overview is based on these guidelines and statements. Additionally selective literature searches have been conducted concerning some key aspects.\nDue to its excellent efficacy, ECT is an important option in the treatment of severe mental disease. Technological innovations and continued development in the psychiatric environment determined the evolution from the electroshock of the 1930s to the ECT of today. This process led to reduced side effects and a stronger patient-oriented praxis.\nECT is a modern, highly effective and safe treatment of severe mental diseases with comparatively few side effects. The method should not be used as a last resort but in an evidence-based way. Patients should be informed timely and adequately about the therapeutic option."}, {"Title": "Biomarkers of a five-domain translational substrate for schizophrenia and schizoaffective psychosis.", "Abstract": "The Mental Health Biomarker Project (2010-2014) selected commercial biochemistry markers related to monoamine synthesis and metabolism and measures of visual and auditory processing performance. Within a case-control discovery design with exclusion criteria designed to produce a highly characterised sample, results from 67 independently DSM IV-R-diagnosed cases of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were compared with those from 67 control participants selected from a local hospital, clinic and community catchment area. Participants underwent protocol-based diagnostic-checking, functional-rating, biological sample-collection for thirty candidate markers and sensory-processing assessment.\nFifteen biomarkers were identified on ROC analysis. Using these biomarkers, odds ratios, adjusted for a case-control design, indicated that schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were highly associated with dichotic listening disorder, delayed visual processing, low visual span, delayed auditory speed of processing, low reverse digit span as a measure of auditory working memory and elevated levels of catecholamines. Other nutritional and biochemical biomarkers were identified as elevated hydroxyl pyrroline-2-one as a marker of oxidative stress, vitamin D, B6 and folate deficits with elevation of serum B12 and free serum copper to zinc ratio. When individual biomarkers were ranked by odds ratio and correlated with clinical severity, five functional domains of visual processing, auditory processing, oxidative stress, catecholamines and nutritional-biochemical variables were formed. When the strengths of their inter-domain relationships were predicted by Lowess (non-parametric) regression, predominant bidirectional relationships were found between visual processing and catecholamine domains. At a cellular level, the nutritional-biochemical domain exerted a pervasive influence on the auditory domain as well as on all other domains.\nThe findings of this biomarker research point towards a much-required advance in Psychiatry: quantification of some theoretically-understandable, translationally-informative, treatment-relevant underpinnings of serious mental illness. This evidence reveals schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in a somewhat different manner, as a conglomerate of several disorders many of which are not currently being assessed-for or treated in clinical settings. Currently available remediation techniques for these underlying conditions have potential to reduce treatment-resistance, relapse-prevention, cost burden and social stigma in these conditions. If replicated and validated in prospective trials, such findings will improve progress-monitoring and treatment-response for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder."}, {"Title": "A schizophrenia-associated HLA locus affects thalamus volume and asymmetry.", "Abstract": "Genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) have recently been shown to have neuronal functions in the thalamus and hippocampus. Common genetic variants in the Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) region, human homologue of the MHC locus, are associated with small effects on susceptibility to schizophrenia, while volumetric changes of the thalamus and hippocampus have also been linked to schizophrenia. We therefore investigated whether common variants of the HLA would affect volumetric variation of the thalamus and hippocampus. We analysed thalamus and hippocampus volumes, as measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging, in 1.265 healthy participants. These participants had also been genotyped using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. We imputed genotypes for single nucleotide polymorphisms at high density across the HLA locus, as well as HLA allotypes and HLA amino acids, by use of a reference population dataset that was specifically targeted to the HLA region. We detected a significant association of the SNP rs17194174 with thalamus volume (nominal P=0.0000017, corrected P=0.0039), as well as additional SNPs within the same region of linkage disequilibrium. This effect was largely lateralized to the left thalamus and is localized within a genomic region previously associated with schizophrenia. The associated SNPs are also clustered within a potential regulatory element, and a region of linkage disequilibrium that spans genes expressed in the thalamus, including HLA-A. Our data indicate that genetic variation within the HLA region influences the volume and asymmetry of the human thalamus. The molecular mechanisms underlying this association may relate to HLA influences on susceptibility to schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Failed drug discovery in psychiatry: time for human genome-guided solutions.", "Abstract": "Our knowledge about the molecular and neural mechanisms of emotional and cognitive processes has increased exponentially in the past decades.

We comment on some of the reasons for failed drug discovery in psychiatry, particularly on the use of ill-suited disease models and on the use of diagnostic constructs unrelated to the underlying biological mechanisms. Furthermore, we argue that the use of human genetic findings together with biologically informed phenotypes and advanced data-mining methodology will catalyze the identification of promising drug targets and, finally, will lead to improved therapeutic outcomes."}, {"Title": "Living in a cold and damp home: frameworks for understanding impacts on mental well-being.", "Abstract": "To carry out a review of recent studies that have explored relationships between mental well-being and how this may be affected by living in cold and damp homes. Attention is focused on intervention studies in which heating and insulation improvements were carried out and impacts on well-being assessed.\nDrawing mainly on a Cochrane Review published in 2013, nine studies of sound methodology are identified and significant effects discussed.\nThe review outlines the current frameworks for understanding mental well-being which prevail in psychology and psychiatry, describing the distinctions that can be made between mental well-being and its elements, namely positive mental health and negative mental health (the latter also known as mental disorder). The review then organizes findings from nine studies into the separate domains of positive and negative mental health, giving due consideration to the quality of the research, instruments used to measure mental health, methodological, and ethical issues.\nThese first nine studies indicate early consensus. Living in cold and damp housing contributes to a variety of different mental health stressors, including persistent worry about debt and affordability, thermal discomfort, and worry about the consequences of cold and damp for health. Improvements to energy efficiency are often associated with significant improvements in mental well-being.\nImpacts affect both positive and negative mental health. A cumulative stress framework is hypothesized, within which the mental health impacts of improved energy efficiency can be better understood."}, {"Title": "Predicted effect size of lisdexamfetamine treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in European adults: Estimates based on indirect analysis using a systematic review and meta-regression analysis.", "Abstract": "There are few approved therapies for adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Europe. Lisdexamfetamine (LDX) is an effective treatment for ADHD; however, no clinical trials examining the efficacy of LDX specifically in European adults have been conducted. Therefore, to estimate the efficacy of LDX in European adults we performed a meta-regression of existing clinical data.\nA systematic review identified US- and Europe-based randomized efficacy trials of LDX, atomoxetine (ATX), or osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) in children/adolescents and adults. A meta-regression model was then fitted to the published/calculated effect sizes (Cohen's d) using medication, geographical location, and age group as predictors. The LDX effect size in European adults was extrapolated from the fitted model. Sensitivity analyses performed included using adult-only studies and adding studies with placebo designs other than a standard pill-placebo design.\nTwenty-two of 2832 identified articles met inclusion criteria. The model-estimated effect size of LDX for European adults was 1.070 (95% confidence interval: 0.738, 1.401), larger than the 0.8 threshold for large effect sizes. The overall model fit was adequate (80%) and stable in the sensitivity analyses.\nThis model predicts that LDX may have a large treatment effect size in European adults with ADHD."}, {"Title": "Who is in the transition gap?

Clinicians identified all cases who had reached the transition boundary (i.e. upper age limit for that CAMHS team) between January and December 2010. Data were collected on clinical and socio-demographic details and factors that informed the decision to refer or not refer to the AMHS, and case notes were scrutinised to ascertain the extent of information exchanged between services during transition.\nA total of 62 service users were identified as having crossed the transition boundary from nine CAMHS [HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster (n=40, 66%), HSE South (n=18, 30%), HSE West (n=2, 3%), HSE Dublin North (n=1, 2%)]. The most common diagnoses were attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n=19, 32%), mood disorders (n=16, 27%), psychosis (n=6, 10%) and eating disorders (n=5, 8%). Forty-seven (76%) of those identified were perceived by the CAMHS clinician to have an 'on-going mental health service need', and of these 15 (32%) were referred, 11 (23%) young people refused and 21 (45%) were not referred, with the majority (12, 57%) continuing with the CAMHS for more than a year beyond the transition boundary. Young people with psychosis were more likely to be referred [\u03c7 2 (2, 46)=8.96, p=0.02], and those with ADHD were less likely to be referred [\u03c7 2 (2, 45)=8.89, p=0.01]. Being prescribed medication was not associated with referral [\u03c7 2 (2, 45)=4.515, p=0.11].

This study aimed to determine the gender distribution among Turkish authors of psychiatry articles published in international scientific journals during a 30-year period.\nThe ISI Web of Science database was searched for all psychiatry publications between 1980 and 2009 using the search term Turkey. All articles were classified according to publication period (1980-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2004, and 2005-2009), gender of the first and last authors, first author title, total number of authors, and type of article.\nIn all, 1961 articles meet the study criteria. The first author of 36.5% of the articles and 34.9% of last authors were women. The percentage of female first and last authors did not differ according to publication period (p=0.57).\nTo the best of our knowledge this is the first study to examine gender and authorship of psychiatric research in Turkey. In total, 33% of academic positions in Turkish university psychiatry departments were occupied by women, which is comparable to the percentage of female first authors of psychiatric research papers from Turkey.

Identification of depressive symptoms and their appropriate treatment is crucial for depressed schizophrenic patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the rates of antidepressant prescription and their outcomes.\nThe records of the schizophrenic outpatients, who were consulted at Psychosis Unit of Psychiatry Department between January 2007 and September 2012, were evaluated retrospectively. Enrolled schizophrenic patients' antidepressant medications were at their minimal effective doses and effective duration.\nThe present study demonstrates that 39 of the 101 patients during their follow-ups were prescribed antidepressants. The mean follow-up period was 6.3 (\u00b14.2) years; the mean age at onset was 22 (\u00b16.5) years; the mean duration of illness was 14.7 (\u00b17.3) years and the mean number of psychotic exacerbation was 5 (\u00b13.7).

There was no significant difference between SSRI (78.6%) and SNRI (21.4%) treatments in terms of psychotic exacerbation under antidepressant medication. Full remission of depressive symptoms was achieved in 21 patients (53.8%). Remission rates were significantly higher (p<0.01) in SNRI treated depressed schizophrenic patients (85.7%) compared to SSRI treated patients (50.9%). In 8 of the 39 patients (20.5%) antidepressant treatment was terminated due to side effects.\nThis study demonstrates that SSRI's were more often prescribed compared to other classes of antidepressants in emerging depressive symptoms in schizophrenic patients despite full remission with SNRI's is more common.

We performed a cross-sectional study assessing records on patients treated with medicine at two outpatient clinics at the child and adolescent psychiatric ward, on 1 day in 2014. Prescriptions of drugs from ATC group N05-N06 were classified according to label status. Six hundred and fifteen drug prescriptions distributed on nine different drugs were prescribed to 503 children eligible for this study. Overall results showed that 170 of the 615 prescriptions were off-label, which corresponds to 27.6 %. Attention deficit hyperkinetic disorder (ADHD) drugs were prescribed 450 times (73.2 %) of which 11 prescriptions were off-label (2.4 %). Other psychotropic drugs comprised 165 (26.8 %) prescriptions and of these 159 (96.4 %) were off-label. With 106 prescriptions, melatonin was the most prescribed of these drugs; all prescriptions were off-label. The main reasons for classifying prescriptions as off-label were age and indication of treatment. This cross-sectional study reveals that medical treatment of children with other psychotropic drugs than ADHD drugs is usually off-label. ADHD drugs were, as the only drug group, primarily prescribed on-label. Although off-label prescription may be rational and even evidence based, the responsibility in case of, e.g. adverse drug reactions is a challenge, and clinical trials in children should be incited."}, {"Title": "Affective processing bias in youth with primary bipolar disorder or primary attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "High rates of comorbidity and overlapping diagnostic criteria between pediatric bipolar disorder (BD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) contribute to diagnostic and treatment confusion.

Participants included 7-17 year olds with either \"narrow-phenotype\" pediatric BD (n = 25), ADHD (n = 25) or TDC (n = 25). Groups were matched on participant age and FSIQ. The effect of emotional stimuli on response control was assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Affective Go/No-Go task (CANTAB AGN). We found a group by target valence interaction on commission errors [F(2,71) = 5.34, p < 0.01, \u019e p (2) = 0.13] whereby ADHD, but not TDC participants, made more errors on negative than positive words [t(24) = -2.58, p < 0.05, r = 0.47]. In contrast, there was a nonsignificant trend for BD participants to make fewer errors on negative versus positive words compared to ADHD and TDC participants.

Our main finding advances what is known about the effect of emotional stimuli on response control in children with ADHD. Our results suggesting a positive affective processing bias in children with ADHD compliment emerging literature show that difficulties with emotional processing and regulation may be core features of ADHD.

With varied religious, ethnic, and socioeconomic heterogeneity among the people in India greatly influencing their dietary habits and with the high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection, Vitamin B12 deficiency is not uncommon, but is often under recognized due to the lack of classical symptomatic presentation.\nRetrospective study on Vitamin B12 deficiency with neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients who attended neurology, psychiatry, and geriatric OPDs for a period of 1 year in a specialized neuropsychiatric institute in South India.\nOut of 259 patients who had Vitamin B12 deficiency (<220 pmol/L), 60 had neuropsychiatric symptoms. Among them the Vitamin B12 levels were <150 (severe), 150-200 (moderate), and 201-220 pmol/L (mild) in 19, 24, 17 patients, respectively. Twenty one were diagnosed with Posterior dementias, 20 with frontotemporal dementia, 7 with Schizophrenia, 4 each with Parkinson's disease and alcohol-dependent syndromes (ADS), 3 with bipolar affective disorder, and 1 with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Eight patients also had hypothyroidism. First symptom of presentation was behavioral disturbances in 30 (50%), memory loss in 20 (33.9%), and sensorimotor and movement disorders in 9 (15.3%), and 56.7% were vegetarians while 43.3% were nonvegetarians. In our study, Vitamin B12 deficiency was more prevalent in elderly males (56.67%) and was associated with increased severity of behavioral disturbances (P = 0.043) which was the most common presentation.

In this meta-analysis, we aimed to determine if any evidence for this treatment option can be derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: Based on the 'World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Guidelines for the Pharmacological Treatment of Eating Disorders', a systematic update literature search was applied to identify all RCTs investigating the efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of SGAs in anorexia nervosa in comparison to placebo/no treatment. The primary outcome was weight gain measured by mean change in body mass index (BMI). Secondary outcomes were mean changes in Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorders Scale (YBC-EDS) total score and Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI) total score and premature discontinuation of treatment. Employing a random-effects model standardized mean differences based on Hedges's g and Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios were calculated. Results: Seven RCTs (n = 201) investigating olanzapine (N = 4), quetiapine (N = 2), and risperidone (N = 1) were included. We found no statistically significant between-group differences for mean BMI change when pooling the SGAs (N = 7, n = 161; Hedges's g = 0.13, 95% CI: -0.17 to 0.43; p = 0.4) and when examining the individual drugs. Furthermore, the SGAs failed to differentiate statistically significantly from placebo/no treatment for all secondary outcomes. Conclusions: Based on the current evidence, pharmacological treatment of anorexia nervosa with SGAs cannot be generally recommended although some individuals or subgroups of patients might benefit from an antipsychotic medication. Further research is required to identify which patients will likely benefit from such a treatment option. \u00a9 2015 S.

Research is revealing how brain-body mechanisms underlie individual differences in psychophysiological reactivity that can be important for predicting, stratifying and treating individuals with anxiety disorders and related conditions. One common constitutional difference is Joint Hypermobility, in which there is an increased range of joint movement as a result of a variant of collagen. Joint hypermobility is over-represented in people with anxiety, mood and neurodevelopmental disorders. It is also linked to stress-sensitive medical conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. Structural differences in \"emotional\" brain regions are reported in hypermobile individuals, and many people with joint hypermobility manifest autonomic abnormalities, typically Postural Tachycardia Syndrome. Enhanced heart rate reactivity during postural change and as recently recognized factors causing vasodilatation (as noted post-prandially, post-exertion and with heat) is characteristic of Postural Tachycardia Syndrome, and there is a phenomenological overlap with anxiety disorders, which may be partially accounted for by exaggerated neural reactivity within ventromedial prefrontal cortex. People who experience Vasovagal Syncope, a heritable tendency to fainting induced by emotional challenges (and needle/blood phobia), are also more vulnerable to anxiety disorders. Neuroimaging implicates brainstem differences in vulnerability to faints, yet the structural integrity of the caudate nucleus appears important for the control of fainting frequency in relation to parasympathetic tone and anxiety. Together there is clinical and neuroanatomical evidence to show that common constitutional differences affecting autonomic responsivity are linked to psychiatric symptoms, notably anxiety."}, {"Title": "Recommendations concerning the new U.S. National Institutes of Health initiative to balance the sex of cells and animals in preclinical research.", "Abstract": "The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced last May that steps will be taken to address the over-reliance on male cells and animals in preclinical research. To further address this announcement, in September 2014, scientists with varying perspectives came together at Georgetown University to discuss the following questions. (1) What metrics should the NIH use to assess tangible progress on policy changes designed to address the over-reliance on male cells and animals in preclinical research? (2) How effective can education be in reducing the over-reliance on male cells and animals in preclinical research and what educational initiatives sponsored by the NIH would most likely effect change? (3) What criteria should the NIH use to determine rigorously defined exceptions to the future proposal requirement of a balance of male and female cells and animals in preclinical studies? (4) What additional strategies in addition to proposal requirements should NIH use to reduce the overreliance of male cells and animals in preclinical research? The resulting consensus presented herein includes input from researchers not only from diverse disciplines of basic and translational science including biology, cell and molecular biology, biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, neuroscience, cardiology, endocrinology, nephrology, psychiatry, and obstetrics and gynecology, but also from recognized experts in publishing, industry, advocacy, science policy, clinical medicine, and population health.

The growing number of homebound patients and the incidence of physical comorbidities and impairment of activities of daily living are important factors for interdisciplinary treatment strategies in old age and there is a need for home-based services providing medical and psychosocial interventions.\nRecent studies have provided information on home-based and collaborative treatment strategies in mentally ill elderly patients.\nThis article provides an overview on selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) conducted with mentally ill older adults.\nStudies have shown promising effects when applying stepped care interventions, collaborative care and assertive community treatment in old patients suffering from mental diseases when compared to usual care. Long-standing home-based mental health programs have been designed and successfully implemented showing improved identification, treatment and ongoing care of mental health problems. In-home tele-psychotherapy has been shown to be efficacious in homebound older adults with limited access to evidence-based psychotherapy and showed a sustained effect in one study.\nCollaborative care models, stepped care interventions in primary care settings and an enhanced inter-professional approach to patient care in old age psychiatry is necessary to improve detection, treatment and ongoing care. Tele-mental health services may become important parts of the provision of mental health services and the effectiveness revealed for in-home tele-health problem solving therapy in old age depression may be an approach to make psychotherapy available to a large number of underserved elderly patients with mental illness."}, {"Title": "Pharmacogenetics informed decision making in adolescent psychiatric treatment: a clinical case report.", "Abstract": "Advances made in genetic testing and tools applied to pharmacogenetics are increasingly being used to inform clinicians in fields such as oncology, hematology, diabetes (endocrinology), cardiology and expanding into psychiatry by examining the influences of genetics on drug efficacy and metabolism. We present a clinical case example of an adolescent male with anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder who did not tolerate numerous medications and dosages over several years in attempts to manage his symptoms. Pharmacogenetics testing was performed and DNA results on this individual elucidated the potential pitfalls in medication use because of specific pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences specifically involving polymorphisms of genes in the cytochrome p450 enzyme system. Future studies and reports are needed to further illustrate and determine the type of individualized medicine approach required to treat individuals based on their specific gene patterns.

The current review explores the meanings of the term, whether it is valid and helpful and how alternative conceptions of severe mental disturbance would shape clinical practice.\nSchizophrenia is a label that implies the presence of a biological disease, but no specific bodily disorder has been demonstrated, and the language of 'illness' and 'disease' is ill-suited to the complexities of mental health problems. Neither does the concept of schizophrenia delineate a group of people with similar patterns of behaviour and outcome trajectories. This is not to deny that some people show disordered speech and behaviour and associated mental suffering, but more generic terms, such as 'psychosis' or just 'madness', would be preferable because they are less strongly associated with the disease model, and enable the uniqueness of each individual's situation to be recognized.\nThe disease model implicit in current conceptions of schizophrenia obscures the underlying functions of the mental health system: the care and containment of people who behave in distressing and disturbing ways. A new social framework is required that makes mental health services transparent, fair and open to democratic scrutiny."}, {"Title": "Telepsychiatry for Neurocognitive Testing in Older Rural Latino Adults.", "Abstract": "As the population of older Latinos in the U.S. increases, availability of culturally adapted geriatric psychiatry services is becoming a growing concern. This issue is exacerbated for rural Latino populations.

Patients (N = 22) received IP and TP testing 2 weeks apart. The order of IP and TP test administrations in individual subjects was determined randomly. Comparison of scores indicated that there were no significant differences between IP and TP test performance though both groups scored non-significantly higher at the second visit.

Sleep is a process the brain requires for proper functioning. Sleep hygiene can be described as practices to ease sleep and to avoid factors which decrease sleep quality. Inadequate sleep hygiene generally results in disturbance of daily life activities due to inability to sustain sleep quality and daytime wakefulness. Therefore, the importance of development and utilization of measures of sleep hygiene increases. The aim of the study was to assess psychometric properties of the Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI) in clinical and non-clinical Turkish samples.\nData were collected from 106 patients with major depression consecutively admitted to the psychiatry clinic of Y\u00fcz\u00fcnc\u00fc Y\u0131l University School of Medicine and 200 were volunteers recruited from community sample who were enrolled at the university. The SHI, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were administered to the subjects. Factor structure of the SHI was evaluated with explanatory and multi-sample confirmatory factor analyses. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients of the SHI with the PSQI, ISI and ESS were computed. Item analyses, internal consistency coefficients and intra-class correlations between two repeated applications in both patient and healthy subjects were calculated.\nThe SHI revealed a unidimensional factor structure. Significant strong partial associations of the SHI with depression, insomnia and poor sleep quality and a modest partial association with sleepiness were detected. Cronbach's alphas for the SHI in community sample and patients with major depression were 0.70 and 0.71, respectively. Additionally, we found acceptable three-week temporal reliability in terms of intra-correlation coefficients of r=0.62, p<0.01 for the community sample and of r=0.67, p<0.01 among patients with major depression.\nThe SHI revealed adequate validity and reliability to be used by researchers in Turkish sample.

Furthermore, we contacted key international organisations related to health education and/or ID in Europe, as well as other regional institutions.\nID modules and contents are minimal in the revised health sciences curricula and publications on ID training in Europe are equally scarce. European countries report few undergraduate and graduate training modules in ID, even in key specialties such as paediatrics. Within the health sector, ID programmes focus mainly on psychiatry and psychology.\nThe poor availability of ID training in health sciences is a matter of concern. However, the current European policy on training provides an opportunity to promote ID in the curricula of programmes at all levels. This strategy should address all professionals working in ID and it should increase the focus on ID relative to other developmental disorders at all stages of life."}, {"Title": "Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder: The road from similarities and clinical heterogeneity to neurobiological types.", "Abstract": "Although diagnosis is a central issue in medical care, in psychiatry its value is still controversial. The function of diagnosis is to indicate treatments and to help clinicians take better care of patients. The fundamental role of diagnosis is to predict outcome and prognosis. To date serious concern persists regarding the clinical utility and predictive validity of the diagnosis system in psychiatry, which is at the most syndromal. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, which nosologists consider two distinct disorders, are the most discussed psychiatric illnesses. Recent findings in different fields of psychiatric research, such as neuroimaging, neuropathology, neuroimmunology, neuropsychology and genetics, have led to other conceptualizations. Individuals with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder vary greatly with regard to symptoms, illness course, treatment response, cognitive and functional impairment and biological correlates. In fact, it is possible to find heterogeneous correlates even within the same syndrome, i.e., from one stage of the disorder to another. Thus, it is possible to identify different subsyndromes, which share some clinical and neurobiological characteristics. The main goal of modern psychiatry is to ovethrow these barriers and to obtain a better understanding of the biological profiles underlying heterogeneous clinical features and thus reduce the variance and lead to a homogeneous definition. The translational research model, which connects the basic neuroscience research field with clinical experience in psychiatry, aims to investigate different neurobiological features of syndromes and of the shared neurobiological features between two syndromes. In fact, this approach should help us to better understand the neurobiological pathways underlying clinical entities, and even to distinguish different, more homogeneous, diagnostic subtypes."}, {"Title": "Inter-disciplinary teaching strategies for mental health law.", "Abstract": "The use of an inter-disciplinary teaching strategy in the context of mental health law is explored here as a means of balancing concerns for the patient's best interests and maximizing their autonomy.

By the late nineteenth century, psychiatry in Europe moved from discussions around asylum-based care to a nuanced and informed debate about the nature of mental symptoms. This included ideas on phrenology and craniometry, biological and psycho-social causes, physical and drug treatments, many of which travelled to India. Simultaneously, indigenous socio-medical ideas were being debated. From the early to the mid-nineteenth century, not much distinction was made between the Western and the native 'mind', and consequently the diagnosis and investigation of mental symptoms did not differ. However, by the late nineteenth century Western medicine considered the 'Western mind' as more civilized and sophisticated than the 'native mind."}, {"Title": "History of leucotomies in Greece.", "Abstract": "In order to present the social, scientific and institutional context which permitted the use of leucotomies in Greece, we have reviewed the Archives of the Medical Associations, the medical literature of the years 1946-56, a reader's dissertation and the memoirs of two psychiatrists.

This study suggests that the lack of thorough research on querulous paranoia in these countries is due to a broad cultural, legal and medical context which has caused unreasonable complainants to be considered a purely legal, rather than a medical issue. To support this hypothesis, I analyse how legal steps have been taken throughout the English-speaking world since 1896 to keep the unreasonable complainants at bay, and I present reasons why medical measures have scarcely been adopted.

However, G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E approaches are not alternatives for gene-hunting but a way to identify genetic and biological mechanisms within subgroups of patients exposed to a similar aetiological (environmental) factor via a process of 'aetiological stratification'. This is important as diagnostic categories targeted by GWA studies are inherently heterogeneous and lack biological validity. Aetiological stratification builds on examining possible phenotypic and/or molecular specificity associated with exposure to the environmental factor across multiple potentially relevant disorders, combined with efforts to identify an underlying biological substrate. G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E hypotheses within this framework investigate (1) which genes influence the degree to which individuals develop identified biological alterations that link environmental exposure to specific phenotypic and/or molecular characteristics within or across psychiatric disorders and (2) which genes are implicated in determining the development of psychopathology once this biological alteration has been brought about. As gene-hunting is not a goal in itself, the examination of pathway and/or polygenic risk scores may be more informative than the examination of individual markers, at the same time reducing multiple testing and the associated risk of spurious findings."}, {"Title": "The impact of the educational environment on career choice and attitudes toward psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The educational environment may influence students' attitudes towards medical specialties, which in turn can affect specialty career choices.

TSH concentrations from patients who tested positive for cocaine on urine toxicology were compared with patients having negative cocaine screenings.\nA total of 192 patients were included: 122 with a positive cocaine screen and 70 with a negative cocaine screen. All patients were screened using a highly sensitive TSH assay. A positive cocaine screen was not associated with a statistically significant difference in TSH concentrations compared with a negative cocaine screen. The percentage of patients with hypothyroidism (TSH >4.50 \u03bcIU/mL) or hyperthyroidism (TSH <0.40 \u03bcIU/mL) were similar in both study groups.\nThe study failed to show that a positive urine screen for cocaine was associated with a significant effect on serum TSH levels in patients admitted to a mental health unit with a diagnosis of cocaine dependence or cocaine intoxication. Our findings support those of a prior study that cocaine use does not affect routine thyroid function tests. The present study does not support the clinical practice of ordering a serum TSH screening test on patients admitted to inpatient psychiatry units soley because the urine screen is positive for cocaine."}, {"Title": "Gender differences in socio-demographic, clinical characteristics and psychiatric diagnosis in/of suicide attempters in a Mexican population.", "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to analyse demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as psychiatric diagnoses to identify gender differences in patients with attempted suicide in a Mexican population.\nBetween September 2010 and September 2012, 140 suicide attempts were documented in the Department of Psychiatry at the General Hospital of Comalcalco (Hospital General de Comalcalco in Spanish) in Tabasco, Mexico. Diagnoses were established using the DSM-IV questionnaire in which Axis I and II were considered. The Suicide Intent Scale was also applied.\nIn our sample, 63.6% were females and 36.4% males. With regard to socio-demographic characteristics, the predominant marital status in males was single, and in females married (\u03c72=5.93, df=2, p=0.05). In occupation the male group was mainly unemployed and housewife in females (\u03c72=55.51, df=4, p<0.001). Male subjects were more likely to consume alcohol (\u03c72=20.40, df=1, p\u22640.001), cannabis (\u03c72=16.62, df=1, p\u22640.001) or tobacco. The prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis was significantly different because, the male group was mainly diagnosed with substance-related disorders, whereas female participants showed a prevalence of stress-related disorders (\u03c72=34.17, gl=4, p=0.0001).\nOur results provide evidence that the characteristics of suicide attempt are different by gender in the Mexican population.

His medical records emerged in 1991 and were published by B. R. Appel in 2006. Daily entries document the treatment typical at that time for what was at first considered to be \"melancholy with delusions\": Shielding from stimuli, physical procedures, and a dietary regimen. The feared, actual diagnosis, a \"general (incomplete) paralysis,\" becomes a certainty in the course of the paranoid-hallucinatory symptoms with cerebro-organic characteristics and agitated states, differences in pupil size, and increasing speech disturbances. In the medicine of the time, syphilis is just emerging as the suspected cause, and the term \"progressive paralysis\" is coined as typical for the course. Proof of the Treponema pallidum infection and the serologic reaction is not obtained until 1906. People close to Robert, in particular his wife Clara and the circle of friends around Brahms and Joachim, cared intensively for him and suffered under the therapeutic isolation.

Children who are fearful, angry, or sad are more likely to have difficulty learning new skills or connecting with others. Many interventions are used in hospital and school settings to help youth, but it is difficult to assess their effectiveness without appropriate assessment tools that are easy to administer, age appropriate, and psychometrically sound. We examined the validity and reliability of the Fast Assessment of Children's Emotions (FACE). After obtaining parental consent and youth assent, 61 patients ages 12 to 17 years were recruited from the psychiatry services at a large children's hospital. Participants completed the FACE, the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS), and a measure of satiety at three time points-before and after a 60-minute psychotherapeutic intervention and after lunch. The FACE measure was significantly correlated with the BRUMS (r(2) = 0.85; p < .001) and not correlated with the satiety measure (r(2) = -0.17; not significant). Cronbach's \u03b1 for the FACE was 0.7734. The FACE showed significant changes in mood from before to after the therapeutic intervention for all patients. For general psychiatry patients, the FACE did not change significantly after lunch, although for patients with eating disorders, the FACE did indicate an increase in distressed emotions after lunch. This finding indicates sensitivity to change in a clinically meaningful manner. The FACE is easy to use and may be used quickly to assess mood changes in adolescents."}, {"Title": "[Evolution of stress in families of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder].", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the evolution of stress in families of children and adolescents who start psychopharmacological treatment after being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and the ability to detect this change using the FSI (Family Strain Index) questionnaire.\nForty eight (48) specialists in child-adolescent psychiatry or neuropediatrics included 429 families of children diagnosed with ADHD, represented by the father, mother or guardian of the child. In the baseline visit, and at two and four months, the intensity of the symptoms of ADHD was evaluated using the abbreviated Conners scale, and family stress was evaluated using the FSI questionnaire.\nThe following was observed: a) an improvement in the overall FSI score and in all its dimensions (P<.001); b) an improvement in the intensity of the symptoms of hyperactivity (Conners, P<.0001); c) good agreement between these two scales at two months (R-intraclass 0.825, P<.0001) and at four months of follow-up (R-intraclass 0.784, P<.0001). Ninety seven point nine percent (97.9%) of the children or adolescents (420) received treatment with modified-release methylphenidate.\nThere was a significant relationship between the positive evolution of symptoms in children with ADHD and the reduction of family stress, as evaluated by the FSI questionnaire, after starting psychopharmacological treatment.

A hidden disorder].", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a common and often chronic psychiatric illness that significantly interferes with the patient\u00b4s functioning and quality of life. The disorder is characterized by excessive intrusive and inappropriate anxiety evoking thoughts as well as time consuming compulsions that cause significant impairment and distress. The symptoms are often accompanied by shame and guilt and the knowledge of the general public and professional community about the disorder is limited. Hence it is frequently misdiagnosed or diagnosed late. There are indications that the disorder is hereditary and that neurobiological processes are involved in its pathophysiology. Several psychological theories about the causes of obsessive-compulsive disorder are supported by empirical evidence. Evidence based treatment is either with serotoninergic medications or cognitive behavioral therapy, particularly a form of behavioral therapy called exposure response prevention. Better treatment options are needed because almost a third of people with obsessive-compulsive disorder respond inadequatly to treatment. In this review article two cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder are presented. The former case is a young man with typical symptoms that respond well to treatment and the latter is a middle aged lady with severe treatment resistant symptoms. She underwent stereotactic implantation of electrodes and received deep brain stimulation, which is an experimental treatment for severe obsessive-compulsive disorder that does not respond to any conventional treatment.

Despite the fact that the motivations for serial killings are typically quite complex, the psychological analysis of a serial killer can provide valuable insight into how and why certain individuals become serial killers. Such knowledge may be instrumental in preventing future serial killings or in solving ongoing cases. In certain serial killings, the various incidents have a variety of similar features. Identification of similarities between separate homicidal incidents is necessary to recognize that a serial killer may be actively killing. In this report, the authors present a group of serial killings involving three prostitutes who were shot to death over a 3-month period. Scene and autopsy findings, including the unusual finding of postmortem enucleation of the eyes, led investigators to recognize the serial nature of the homicides."}, {"Title": "Common Polymorphisms in the Age of Research Domain Criteria (RDoC): Integration and Translation.", "Abstract": "The value of common polymorphisms in guiding clinical psychiatry is limited by the complex polygenic architecture of psychiatric disorders. Common polymorphisms have too small an effect on risk for psychiatric disorders as defined by clinical phenomenology to guide clinical practice. To identify polymorphic effects that are large and reliable enough to serve as biomarkers requires detailed analysis of a polymorphism's biology across levels of complexity from molecule to cell to circuit and behavior. Emphasis on behavioral domains rather than clinical diagnosis, as proposed in the Research Domain Criteria framework, facilitates the use of mouse models that recapitulate human polymorphisms because effects on equivalent phenotypes can be translated across species and integrated across levels of analysis. A knockin mouse model of a common polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) provides examples of how such a vertically integrated translational approach can identify robust genotype-phenotype relationships that have relevance to psychiatric practice."}, {"Title": "[Features of regional mandatory psychiatric care in Germany: analysis using the VIPP databank].", "Abstract": "The regional mandatory care is a central element of psychiatric treatment in Germany. Therefore, it is possible to realize care near to the place of residence of psychiatric patients and good contact to the outpatient health system. Up to now the new payment system in psychiatry in Germany does not explicitly include this central factor.\nThe article investigates which criteria possibly describe psychiatric mandatory care and whether they can be ascertained from routine data.\nThe results are based on the so-called \u00a7\u00a021 records of 47 psychiatric and psychosomatic clinics all of which participated in the German VIPP (healthcare indicators in psychiatry and psychosomatics) project. It is obligatory to send the standardized \u00a7\u00a021 record to the Institute for the Hospital Remuneration System (InEK) annually.\nThe study identified two factors which could describe clinics with regional mandatory care. Many patients attend these hospitals outside the core time of Monday to Friday, 8\u00a0am to 5\u00a0pm and the distance to their place of residence is shorter. This is associated with a higher day-related valuation, the so-called day mix index (DMI).\nRoutine data contain information describing regional mandatory psychiatric care. Patients treated in this system show a higher DMI. This means higher proceeds for the hospitals but it is not clear if these proceeds are able to cover the higher costs in clinics with regional mandatory care. Therefore, it is necessary for the InEK to set up a new cost center for all clinics which participate as a so-called calculation site. By posting all structural costs of mandatory care in this cost center it will be possible to compare them with the income of psychiatric clinics in the future."}, {"Title": "Practical clinical trials in psychopharmacology: a systematic review.", "Abstract": "Practical clinical trials (PCTs) are randomized experiments under typical practice conditions with the aim of testing the \"real-life\" benefits and risks of therapeutic interventions.

This review examines recent progress in conducting PCTs in psychopharmacology. The January 2000 to October 2014 MEDLINE, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for peer-reviewed publications of PCTs with at least 100 subjects per treatment arm. Most PCTs in psychiatry evaluated mental health services or psychosocial interventions rather than specific pharmacotherapies. Of 157 PCTs in psychiatry, 30 (19%) were in psychopharmacology, with a median of 2 publications per year and no increase during the period of observation. Sample size ranged from 200 to 18,154; only 11 studies randomized 500 patients or more. Psychopharmacology PCTs were equally likely to be funded by industry as by public agencies. There were 10 PCTs of antidepressants, for a total of 4206 patients (in comparison with at least 46 PCTs of antihypertensive medications, for a total of 208,014 patients). Some psychopharmacology PCTs used suicidal behavior, treatment discontinuation, or mortality as primary outcome and produced effectiveness and safety data that have influenced both practice guidelines and regulatory decisions. Practical clinical trials can constitute an important source of information for clinicians, patients, regulators, and policy makers but have been relatively underused in psychopharmacology.

Using conversation analysis (CA), we compare sequential environments where psychiatrists use two turn designs for proposing a treatment: the inclusive 'we' form (for example 'let's' and 'how about') and the declarative evaluation (for example, 'it might be better'). The inclusive 'we' form is used to create the moment for decision when the sequential environment is ready for decision-making. The declarative evaluation is used to propose a treatment cautiously when the sequential environment is not yet ready for decision-making. Taken together, psychiatrists fit the turn design of a proposal to its sequential environment in such a way as to display their attention to the patients' perspectives. In conclusion, we argue that our finding provides further evidence for the claim made by a growing body of CA research that, unlike the traditional sociological understanding of doctor-patient interaction, doctors do not simply impose their perspectives upon the patients but steer medical encounters to their preferred direction by orienting to the patients' perspectives."}, {"Title": "Increased risk of antidepressant use in childhood cancer survivors: a Danish population-based cohort study.", "Abstract": "Childhood cancer survivors are at risk of both somatic and mental late effects, but large population-based studies of depression are lacking.\nRisk of antidepressant use was evaluated in a population-based cohort of 5452 Danish children treated for cancer in 1975-2009 by linkage to the National Prescription Drug Database, which worldwide is the oldest nationwide registry of prescription medication.

This is especially made worse because interferon-alpha, as part of the standard of care, may exacerbate depressive symptoms and cause suicidal symptoms to appear. This requires a treatment setting that has the capacity to carry out psychiatric assessment and monitoring, and the capability to deliver patient education regarding these aspects of care. Psychiatric comorbidities create a challenging decision-making situation, especially since success rates for the most common hepatitis C genotype, genotype 1, hover around 40%. In recent years, new treatments have emerged. These significantly boost the likelihood of sustained viral response, including for genotype 1, and do not seem to have the side effects of interferon-alpha or ribavirin. Relevant data are reviewed to assess the degree that these new treatments might reduce the portion not eligible for treatment due to psychiatric comorbidities, and might reduce the emergence of psychiatric symptoms during treatment. Several organizations have recently released evidence-based treatment recommendation guidelines. It is apparent that interferon-alpha continues to be a standard of care, with the new drugs added to this recognized regimen in order to shorten treatment and to boost efficacy. Clinical settings must continue to assess appropriateness for treatment, including current or recent psychiatric comorbidities, and must continue to closely monitor patients for the emergence of psychiatric side effects. The newly developed hepatitis C treatments may affect the metabolism of several categories of psychiatric drugs, and so drug-drug interactions must also be considered and monitored. With many promising drugs under development, an all-pill regimen, with no interferon-alpha and no ribavirin, may emerge in the near future.

Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic with proven efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder, with a pharmacological profile distinct from other available antipsychotics and a side-effect profile that is different from other agents in the class; these characteristics make it a possible alternative in patients requiring a change in antipsychotic treatment due to lack of efficacy or persistent side-effects.\nA panel of Italian experts in psychiatry met to discuss the appropriateness of current strategies for the switch to aripiprazole in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder once a clinician has decided to adopt this choice and also to propose alternate strategies where required. The strategies for the switch to aripiprazole presented in this position paper consider various scenarios encountered in clinical practice, highlight the importance of tapering the prior antipsychotic based on its pharmacological characteristics and provide detailed guidance throughout the entire switching process.

In particular, ADHD and OCD patients who are also suffering from tics are more likely to be referred to psychiatric outpati\u00ebnt clinics because of their ADHD or OCD status than because of their tics.\nGTS belongs to the domain of psychiatry because of the psychological aspects of tics, the feasibility of treatment with behaviour therapy and the crucial role played by comorbidity in the course of the disorder."}, {"Title": "Clinical observation, pharmacotherapy and referral on discharge of patients with anxiety disorder in a psychiatric emergency service.", "Abstract": "To analyze factors associated with clinical observation, pharmacotherapy and referral on discharge of patients with anxiety disorder (AD) seeking care at a psychiatric emergency unit.\nA total of 5003 consecutive visits were reviewed over a three-year period at a psychiatric emergency service in a tertiary university hospital. Data collected included sociodemographic and clinical information as well as the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and the Severity Psychiatric Illness (SPI) scale scores.\nOf all the visits, 992 (19.8%) were diagnosed of AD. Of these, 19.6% required clinical observation and 72.2% were referred to a psychiatrist at discharge. Regression analysis showed that referral to psychiatry was associated with being male, native, psychiatric background, greater severity, lower global functioning, and behavioral disorders. Clinical observation (in a box) was associated with being female, greater severity, and psychotic or behavioral symptoms. Prescription of benzodiazepines was associated with anxiety, no history of addiction, and lower global functioning. Antidepressants were associated with being a native, anxiety with no history of addiction, and lower functioning. Antipsychotics were associated with being native, psychiatric background (not addiction), anxiety, and lower functioning.\nBehavior, psychiatric background and illness severity were determinants of referral to a specialist. Besides these, psychotic symptoms and non-specific clinical symptoms were determinants of observation. Drug prescription in AD is less frequent if the main complaint is not anxiety and depends more on the level of functioning than on that of severity."}, {"Title": "Hearing the inaudible experimental subject: Echoes of Inaudi, Binet's calculating prodigy.", "Abstract": "Historians of psychology have traditionally focused on ideas (intellectual history), the \"great men\" who produced them (an older style of biography sometimes called \"hagiography\"), or-more recently-the influence of the contexts that shaped them (social and cultural history). A still more recent approach is to bring in those invisible subjects whose experiences have previously been ignored, most often through histories focusing on the discipline's forgotten women or minority contributors: \"history from below\" (subaltern history). A variation on this was popularized in the history of psychiatry (viz., \"patient voices\") and has since been carried into the history of psychology (e.g., \"feminist voices\"). The latest innovation is to focus on what Jill Morawski has referred to as \"the discipline's experimental subjects.\" (These are the collective done-to, rather than the doers, of psychological research.) This history is one of those: an attempt to look behind Alfred Binet to find an influence that shaped his work. The purpose is thus to \"give voice\" to this unheard-from subject-the until-now inaudible Jacques Inaudi (including excerpts from newspaper interviews and translations from his recently discovered autobiography)-and at the same time advance Morawski's historiographical project. We then get a glimpse of what it was like to be a child prodigy in France in the 1880s, as well as what securing scientific patrons could do for one's prospects. By focusing specifically on Binet's unheard-from experimental subject, we are also afforded new perspectives of the history of late-19th century French psychology (reflecting another emerging interest, \"international history\"), and we gain new insights into the prehistory of contemporary Binet-style intelligence testing."}, {"Title": "Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis presenting as atypical anorexia nervosa: an adolescent case report.", "Abstract": "Since 2007, more than 600 patients have been diagnosed with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis, with almost 40 % of those affected being children or adolescents.

To understand these differences, we first systematically searched Web of Science for the literature on recessions and health yielding 461 articles and 14,401 cited documents. We then undertook a network analysis of co-citation pattern by disciplines, journals and backgrounds of the authors, followed by a chronological review of the literature, to trace the evolution of ideas. We then examined the extent to which earlier literature predicted what has happened in the 2007-2012 crisis. Our analysis finds the literature is dominated by disciplinary silos, with economics studies predominantly citing each other and relative isolation of psychiatry and substance abuse journals. Different philosophical approaches to assessing causality appear to contribute to varying interpretations, a tendency that is unlikely to be resolved without a shift in research norms. We conclude by calling for more inter-disciplinary research that combines empirical findings with a search for plausible mechanisms. This approach would evaluate not only the effects of economic shocks but also the mechanisms that offer protection against them."}, {"Title": "An investigation of the relationship between the caseload model of midwifery for socially disadvantaged women and childbirth outcomes using routine data--a retrospective, observational study.", "Abstract": "the objective of this study was to describe and compare childbirth outcomes and processes for women with complex social factors who received caseload midwifery care, and standard maternity care in the UK.\nwomen with complex social factors experience high rates of morbidity, mortality and poor birth outcomes. A caseload team was established to support these women throughout pregnancy and childbirth by providing continuity and individualised care.\ndata was collected from computerised birth details of 194 women with complex social factors who presented for maternity care between May 2012 and June 2013; 96 received standard care and 98 caseload care.

Patients with schizophrenia or depression are likely to be undergoing Western treatment when they are referred to an acupuncturist for (add-on) treatment, and knowledge of both types of treatments is necessary to integrate them successfully. In this study, the different Traditional Oriental Medicine (TOM) diagnostic patterns in patients with a Western diagnosis of schizophrenia, depression, or sleep disorders are described from a literature and a clinical perspective. The data on 30 depression and 30 schizophrenia patients from a German study are presented. Our results show that if a psychiatric group, sorted in accordance to Western diagnostic principles, is diagnosed on the basis of TOM diagnostic patterns, it can be categorized into different groups of patients with psychiatric disorders; this finding has far-reaching consequences in scientific research on acupuncture. Moreover, we found a high prevalence of sleep disorders in patients with both schizophrenia and depression, which could be explained from the perspective of a TOM diagnostic pattern. Finally, we discuss sleep quality as a treatment objective that may play a crucial role in mediating acupuncture-induced treatment effects in patients with schizophrenia and depression."}, {"Title": "The milestones for psychosomatic medicine subspecialty training.", "Abstract": "The Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education Milestones project is a key element in the Next Accreditation System for graduate medical education.

The AMLC reflects a collaborative effort of the departments of internal medicine/infectious diseases, rheumatology, neurology, dermatology, medical microbiology and psychiatry. In a retrospective case series, characteristics of 200 adult patients referred to the AMLC were recorded, and patients were classified as having LB, post-treatment LB syndrome (PTLBS), persistent Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) infection despite antibiotic treatment or no LB. In addition, LB, PTLBS and persistent B. burgdorferi s.l. infection cases were classified as 'definite,' 'probable' or 'questionable.' Of the 200 patients, 120 (60%) did not have LB and 31 (16%) had a form of localized or disseminated LB, of which 12 were classified as definite, six as probable and 13 as questionable. In addition, 34 patients (17%) were diagnosed with PTLBS, of which 22 (11%) were probable and 12 (6%) questionable. A total of 15 patients (8%) were diagnosed with persistent B. burgdorferi s.l. infection, of which none was classified as definite, three as probable and 12 as questionable. In conclusion, in line with previous studies, the number of definite and probable (persisting) LB cases was low. The overall high number of questionable cases illustrates the fact that it can sometimes be challenging to either rule out or demonstrate an association with a B. burgdorferi s.l. infection, even in an academic setting.

On one account, mindreading depends on making theoretical inferences about another person's mental states based on knowledge of folk psychology, the so-called \"theory theory\" (TT). On a different account, \"simulation theory\" (ST), mindreading depends on simulating the other's mental states within one's own mental or motor system. A third approach, \"interaction theory\" (IT), looks to embodied processes (involving movement, gesture, facial expression, vocal intonation, etc.) and the dynamics of intersubjective interactions (joint attention, joint action, and processes not confined to an individual system) in highly contextualized situations to explain social cognition, and disruptions of these processes in some psychopathological conditions. In this paper, we present a brief summary of these three theoretical frameworks (TT, ST, IT). We then focus on impaired social abilities in autism and schizophrenia from the perspective of the three approaches. We discuss the limitations of such approaches in the scientific studies of these and other pathologies, and we close with a short reflection on the future of the field.

Evidence-based treatments such as buprenorphine maintenance therapy (BMT) remain underutilized. Offering BMT in primary care settings has the potential to reduce overall costs of care, decrease medical morbidity associated with opioid dependence, and improve treatment outcomes. However, access to BMT, especially in rural areas, remains limited. This article will present a review of barriers to adoption of BMT among family physicians in a primarily rural area in the USA.\nAn anonymous survey of family physicians practicing in Vermont or New Hampshire, two largely rural states, was conducted. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative questions, focused on BMT adoption and physician opinions of opioids. Specific factors assessed included physician factors, physicians' understanding of patient factors, and logistical issues.\nOne-hundred and eight family physicians completed the survey. Approximately 10% were buprenorphine prescribers. More than 80% of family physicians felt they regularly saw patients addicted to opiates. The majority (70%) felt that they, as family physicians, bore responsibility for treating opiate addiction. Potential logistical barriers to buprenorphine adoption included inadequately trained staff (88%), insufficient time (80%), inadequate office space (49%), and cumbersome regulations (37%). Common themes addressed in open-ended questions included lack of knowledge, time, or interest; mistrust of people with addiction or buprenorphine; and difficult patient population.\nThis study aims to quantify perceived barriers to treatment and provide insight expanding the community of family physicians offering BMT. The results suggest family physicians are excellent candidates to provide BMT, as most report regularly seeing opioid-addicted patients and believe that treating opioid addiction is their responsibility. Significant barriers remain, including inadequate staff training, lack of access to addiction experts, and perceived efficacy of BMT. Addressing these barriers may lower resistance to buprenorphine adoption and increase access to BMT in rural areas."}, {"Title": "[Violence and psychosocial risks: narratives of adolescents living in shelters in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil].", "Abstract": "This article contains part of the results of the \"Youth, Disaffiliation and Violence\" extension project developed at the Institute of Psychiatry of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in 2008. It seeks to present experiences of violence experienced in three different contexts, namely in the family home, on the streets and in shelter units (SU), from the standpoint of adolescents. Thirty adolescents in five SUs in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro were interviewed.

However, it is not sufficient to adapt the adult dosages to achieve systemic exposure levels similar to those effective in adults. This can be done with increasing predictive accuracy but before accepting that the same plasma levels should result in the same efficacy as in adults both the mechanism of action of the drug and the pathophysiology of the disease must be considered. For psychiatric disorders there is often insufficient evidence to support the assumptions for extrapolating efficacy as it is not even always sure that the same diagnostic categories correspond to the same disease in adults and children. Even when the basic biological alteration behind the disorder could be considered the same, the psychodynamic consequences and the role of non-pharmacological approaches to treatment may substantially differ across age groups. These facts, together with the absence of detailed historical data on the actual correlations between paediatric and adult responses for many types of psycho-therapeutic medicines, make it difficult to accept extrapolation as the main proof of efficacy in children and adolescents. A corollary is that since efficacy studies will normally be required, they should not be unduly postponed. For products addressing a medical need with good scientific plausibility, they should be initiated as soon as the anticipated safety concerns can be reasonably managed within the context of a paediatric clinical trial."}, {"Title": "Sheehan's Syndrome Presenting as Major Depressive Disorder.", "Abstract": "Sheehan's syndrome or Simmond's disease is a rare endocrine disorder seen in clinical practice.

Hippocampal ADNP transcript content was doubled in male vs female mice, with females showing equal expression to ADNP haploinsufficient (ADNP(+/)(-)) males and no significant genotype-associated reduction. Increased male ADNP expression was replicated in human postmortem hippocampal samples. The hippocampal transcript for apolipoprotein E (the major risk gene for AD) was doubled in female mice compared with males, and further doubled in the ADNP(+/-) females, contrasting a decrease in ADNP(+/-) males. Previously, overexpression of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) led to ASD-like phenotype in mice. Here, we identified binding sites on ADNP for eIF4E and co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, hippocampal eIF4E expression was specifically increased in young ADNP(+/-) male mice. Behaviorally, ADNP(+/-) male mice exhibited deficiencies in object recognition and social memory compared with ADNP(+/+) mice, while ADNP(+/-) females were partially spared. Contrasting males, which preferred novel over familiar mice, ADNP(+/+) females showed no preference to novel mice and ADNP(+/-) females did not prefer mice over object.

In lower middle-income countries, patients with depressive symptoms had significantly less mood symptom cluster (P\u2009<\u20090.001) but significantly more cognitive symptom cluster (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nThis study demonstrates that in Asia, despite variations in the initial symptom reported by the patients, across different countries/territories, core depressive symptoms remain the same. Variations have been found in presentation of depressive symptoms with regards to the level of income of countries. Physical or vegetative symptoms were reported more by centers in higher income countries, while depressive cognition and suicidal thoughts/acts were more frequently reported from lower income countries."}, {"Title": "Informed Consent at Gunpoint: When Psychiatry Affects Gun Ownership.", "Abstract": "As states take more steps to connect patients' gun ownership to their mental health, psychiatrists are being asked to provide mental health information after clinical interviews as well as after confiscation. This move into the patient-physician relationship raises new questions about how psychiatrists should obtain informed consent when interviews may result in reports to legal authorities. Consent warnings are already practiced more in the breach than in the observance and informed consent is imperfect at its best. In communities torn by controversies surrounding gun control, vehement political views will further influence these established themes to result in unprecedented pressures on patient confidentiality. This analysis draws on new movements in ethical theory and behavioral medicine that go beyond balancing principles to question the use of psychiatry in firearm reporting, and support a vigorous practice of informed consent to protect both individuals and the communities they live in."}, {"Title": "Neuroticism and facial emotion recognition in healthy adults.", "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to examine whether healthy individuals with higher levels of neuroticism, a robust independent predictor of psychopathology, exhibit altered facial emotion recognition performance.\nFacial emotion recognition accuracy was investigated in 104 healthy adults using the Degraded Facial Affect Recognition Task (DFAR). Participants' degree of neuroticism was estimated using neuroticism scales extracted from the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and the Revised NEO Personality Inventory.\nA significant negative correlation between the degree of neuroticism and the percentage of correct answers on DFAR was found only for happy facial expression (significant after applying Bonferroni correction).\nAltered sensitivity to the emotional context represents a useful and easy way to obtain cognitive phenotype that correlates strongly with inter-individual variations in neuroticism linked to stress vulnerability and subsequent psychopathology.

The PROMIS(\u00ae) Applied Cognition-Abilities scales were developed, evaluated, and distributed by the National Institutes of Health to measure perceived cognitive functioning. This study examines several aspects of the reliability and validity of the PROMIS(\u00ae) Applied Cognition-Abilities eight and four-item scales in a sample of adult and older adult medical outpatients (N = 148). Internal consistency reliability was high for both PROMIS(\u00ae) cognition scales. The brief four-item scale was highly correlated with the full eight-item scale (rs = 0.98). There was a moderate correlation between the PROMIS(\u00ae) Applied Cognition-Abilities scales and measures of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7). Subgroups of participants screening positively for depression or anxiety reported significantly worse cognitive functioning than medical controls, with large effect sizes. The base rates of individual items endorsed by depressed, anxious, and control participants are reported. More than 42% of depressed and anxious participants reported problems with their memory and concentration compared with fewer than 8% of medical controls. The field would benefit from studies using the PROMIS(\u00ae) Applied Cognition-Abilities scales in more demographically diverse samples and with other established measures of cognition."}, {"Title": "To do good might hurt bad: exploring nurses' understanding and approach to suffering in forensic psychiatric settings.", "Abstract": "Patients in forensic psychiatric settings not only have to deal with their mental illness, but also memories of criminal activities and being involuntarily hospitalized. The aim of the present study was to explore how nurses working in forensic psychiatric services understand and approach patients' experiences of suffering. Data were generated by semistructured interviews with psychiatric nurses from two different forensic psychiatric units in Sweden. Data were analysed by means of a hermeneutic approach inspired by Ricoeur's hermeneutics. The findings are reflected in four main themes: (i) ignoring suffering; (ii) explaining suffering as a natural and inevitable part of daily life in the forensic context; (iii) ascribing meaning to suffering; and, (iv) being present in suffering. To engage in alleviating suffering is a struggle that demands courage and the strength to reflect on its character and consequences. To encounter suffering means that nurses are not only confronted with patients' suffering, but also their own reactions to those patients. If suffering is not recognized or encountered, there is a risk that actions may have a negative impact on patients."}, {"Title": "The science of early adversity: is there a role for large institutions in the care of vulnerable children?", "Abstract": "It has been more than 80 years since researchers in child psychiatry first documented developmental delays among children separated from family environments and placed in orphanages or other institutions. Informed by such findings, global conventions, including the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, assert a child's right to care within a family-like environment that offers individualised support. Nevertheless, an estimated 8 million children are presently growing up in congregate care institutions. Common reasons for institutionalisation include orphaning, abandonment due to poverty, abuse in families of origin, disability, and mental illness. Although the practice remains widespread, a robust body of scientific work suggests that institutionalisation in early childhood can incur developmental damage across diverse domains. Specific deficits have been documented in areas including physical growth, cognitive function, neurodevelopment, and social-psychological health. Effects seem most pronounced when children have least access to individualised caregiving, and when deprivation coincides with early developmental sensitive periods. Offering hope, early interventions that place institutionalised children into families have afforded substantial recovery. The strength of scientific evidence imparts urgency to efforts to achieve deinstitutionalisation in global child protection sectors, and to intervene early for individual children experiencing deprivation."}, {"Title": "Mental health law in Germany.", "Abstract": "There is no national mental health law in Germany: the 16 German states are responsible for legislation concerning forced admissions, while the German Civil Code covers non-acute care, in particular for those not able to care for themselves.

However, no single theory of violence has ever been universally accepted by a majority of established researchers. Psychiatry, psychology and sociology are each subdivided into different schools relying upon different premises. All theories can produce empirical evidence for their validity, some of them stating the opposite of each other. Calculating different models with multivariate logistic regression on a dataset of N = 21,312 observations and ninety-two influences allowed a direct comparison of the performance of operationalizations of some of the most important schools. The psychopathology model ranked as the best model in terms of predicting violence right after the comprehensive interdisciplinary model. Next came the rational choice and lifestyle model and third the differential association and learning theory model. Other models namely the control theory model, the childhood-trauma model and the social conflict and reaction model turned out to have low sensitivities for predicting violence. Nevertheless, all models produced acceptable results in predictions of a non-violent outcome."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric comorbidity: fact or artifact?", "Abstract": "The frequent occurrence of comorbidity has brought about an extensive theoretical debate in psychiatry. Why are the rates of psychiatric comorbidity so high and what are their implications for the ontological and epistemological status of comorbid psychiatric diseases? Current explanations focus either on classification choices or on causal ties between disorders. Based on empirical and philosophical arguments, we propose a conventionalist interpretation of psychiatric comorbidity instead. We argue that a conventionalist approach fits well with research and clinical practice and resolves two problems for psychiatric diseases: experimenter's regress and arbitrariness."}, {"Title": "MicroRNA and Posttranscriptional Dysregulation in Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric syndromes, including schizophrenia, mood disorders, and autism spectrum disorders, are characterized by a complex range of symptoms, including psychosis, depression, mania, and cognitive deficits. Although the mechanisms driving pathophysiology are complex and remain largely unknown, advances in the understanding of gene association and gene networks are providing significant clues to their etiology. In recent years, small noncoding RNA molecules known as microRNA (miRNA) have emerged as potential players in the pathophysiology of mental illness. These small RNAs regulate hundreds of target transcripts by modifying their stability and translation on a broad scale, influencing entire gene networks in the process. There is evidence to suggest that numerous miRNAs are dysregulated in postmortem neuropathology of neuropsychiatric disorders, and there is strong genetic support for association of miRNA genes and their targets with these conditions. This review presents the accumulated evidence linking miRNA dysregulation and dysfunction with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and autism spectrum disorders and the potential of miRNAs as biomarkers or therapeutics for these disorders. We further assess the functional roles of some outstanding miRNAs associated with these conditions and how they may be influencing the development of psychiatric symptoms."}, {"Title": "Statins and myotoxic effects associated with anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase autoantibodies: an observational study in Japan.", "Abstract": "Statins have a variety of myotoxic effects and can trigger the development of inflammatory myopathies or myasthenia gravis (MG) mediated by immunomodulatory properties. Autoantibodies to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) have been identified in patients with statin-associated myopathy. The purpose of the present study is to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of anti-HMGCR antibodies and to elucidate the clinical significance of anti-HMGCR antibodies in Japanese patients with inflammatory myopathies or MG. We enrolled 75 patients with inflammatory myopathies, who were all negative for anti-signal recognition particle and anti-aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetase antibodies. They were referred to Keio University and National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry between October 2010 and September 2012. We also studied 251 patients with MG who were followed at the MG Clinic at Keio University Hospital. Anti-HMGCR antibodies were detected by ELISA. We investigated demographic, clinical, radiological, and histological findings associated with anti-HMGCR antibodies. We established the anti-HMGCR ELISA with the recombinant protein. Protein immunoprecipitation detected autoantigens corresponding to HMGCR. Immunohistochemistry using muscle biopsy specimens revealed regenerating muscle fibers clearly stained by polyclonal anti-HMGCR antibodies and patients' serum. Anti-HMGCR autoantibodies were specifically detected in 8 patients with necrotizing myopathy. The seropositivity rate in the necrotizing myopathy patients was significantly higher than those in the patients with other histological diagnoses of inflammatory myopathies (31% vs 2%, P\u200a=\u200a0.001). Statins were administered in only 3 of the 8 anti-HMGCR-positive patients. Myopathy associated with anti-HMGCR antibodies showed mild limb weakness and favorable response to immunotherapy. All 8 patients exhibited increased signal intensities on short T1 inversion recovery of muscle MRI. Of the 251 patients with MG, 23 were administered statins at the onset of MG. One late-onset MG patient experienced MG worsening after 4-wk treatment with atorvastatin. However, anti-HMGCR antibodies were not detected in the 251 MG patients except for one early-onset MG patient with no history of statin therapy. Anti-HMGCR antibodies are a relevant clinical marker of necrotizing myopathy with or without statin exposure, but they are not associated with the onset or deterioration of MG."}, {"Title": "Custody, care and country of origin: demographic and diagnostic admission statistics at an inner-city adult psychiatry unit.", "Abstract": "Involuntary detention is a feature of psychiatric care in many countries. We previously reported an involuntary admission rate of 67.7 per 100,000 population per year in inner-city Dublin (January 2008-December 2010), which was higher than Ireland's national rate (38.5). We also found that the proportion of admissions that was involuntary was higher among individuals born outside Ireland (33.9%) compared to those from Ireland (12.0%), apparently owing to increased diagnoses of schizophrenia in the former group. In the present study (January 2011-June 2013) we again found that the proportion of admissions that was involuntary was higher among individuals from outside Ireland (32.5%) compared to individuals from Ireland (9.9%) (p<0.001), but this is primarily attributable to a lower rate of voluntary admission among individuals born outside Ireland (206.1 voluntary admissions per 100,000 population per year; deprivation-adjusted rate: 158.5) compared to individuals from Ireland (775.1; deprivation-adjusted rate: 596.2). Overall, admission rates in our deprived, inner-city catchment area remain higher than national rates and this may be attributable to differential effects of Ireland's recent economic problems on different areas within Ireland. The relatively low rate of voluntary admission among individuals born outside Ireland may be attributable to different patterns of help-seeking which mental health services in Ireland need to take into account in future service-planning. Other jurisdictions could also usefully focus attention not just on rates on involuntary admission among individuals born elsewhere, but also rates of voluntary admission which may provide useful insights for service-planning and delivery."}, {"Title": "Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder and Risk of Suicide.", "Abstract": "A 30-year-old male patient developed a hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) after smoking cannabis laced with phencyclidine (PCP) or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) 10 years prior to hospital admission. Clinically, he reported seeing vivid, saturated colors and caricature-like objects. The patient described perceiving objects or people in motion as moving faster than normal. He reported living in a dream-like state and feeling numb and detached from other people and his surroundings. Upon pharmacotherapy initiation, facility transfer, and subsequent discharge from an acute psychiatry unit, he ultimately committed suicide. Although hallucinogen abuse is common in the United States, this case suggests that HPPD maybe significantly underdiagnosed and undertreated. In some cases, this oversight may perpetuate years of unnecessary patient suffering and can ultimately lead to severe depression and suicide."}, {"Title": "The POPPY Research Programme protocol: investigating opioid utilisation, costs and patterns of extramedical use in Australia.", "Abstract": "Opioid prescribing is increasing in many countries. In Australia, there is limited research on patterns of prescribing and access, or the outcomes associated with this use.

In a cohort of new opioid users, commencing therapy between 1 July 2009 and 31 December 2013, we will examine patterns of opioid use including initiation of therapy, duration of treatment and concomitant use of opioids and other prescribed medicines. We will also examine patterns of extramedical opioid use based on indicators including excess dosing, use of more than one opioid concomitantly, doctor/pharmacy shopping and accelerated time to prescription refill.\nThis protocol was approved by the NSW Population and Health Services Ethics Committee (March 2014) and data access approved by the Department of Human Services External Review Evaluation Committee (June 2014). This will be one of the first comprehensive Australian studies with the capability to investigate individual patterns of use and track extramedical use. In the first instance our analysis will be based on 5\u2005years of dispensing data but will be expanded with ongoing annual data updates. This research has the capability to contribute significantly to pharmaceutical policy within Australia and globally. In particular, the trajectory of extramedical prescription-opioid use has been the subject of limited research to date.

These depressed mothers often harm themselves and negatively impact their family and community.\nThis study examines maternal depression and its related factors in the mothers of school-aged children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nA cross-sectional study with a purposive sampling of 100 mothers of school-age children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder was developed. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire that included the Parenting Stress Index (PSI), social support scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The Pearson product moment correlation and stepwise multiple regression were used to analyze data.\nThe findings showed that almost half of the mothers with school-aged ADHD children suffered higher pa-renting stress and that 34% required professional psychiatry referral. In addition, 40% of the participants suffered from depression. Higher levels of parenting stress were associated with a higher incidence of depression (r = .647, p < .001). Participants with better social support had lower depression levels (r = -.327, p < .01). 'Parenting stress' and having a monthly total household income of \u2264 NT$40,000 were significant predictors of maternal depression. 'Maternal stress' was the most significant predictor, with a total explained variance of 41.9% (R(2) change = 41.9%).\nThe results of this study are intended to help medical staff better care for the mothers of school-aged children with ADHD. These results will assist in the evaluation of maternal depression, parenting stress, and levels of required social support. It will especially help in the evaluation of maternal depression symptoms of those mothers of low socioeconomic status with high parenting stress. Providing these mothers with parental training, education on effective parenting and discipline strategies, and better social support may effectively reduce maternal depression, which will help minimize the negative impacts of this depression on the family and the community."}, {"Title": "Salivary proteomics and biomarkers in neurology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Biomarkers are greatly needed in the fields of neurology and psychiatry, to provide objective and earlier diagnoses of CNS conditions. Proteomics and other omics MS-based technologies are tools currently being utilized in much recent CNS research. Saliva is an interesting alternative biomaterial for the proteomic study of CNS disorders, with several advantages. Collection is noninvasive and saliva has many proteins. It is easier to collect than blood and can be collected by professionals without formal medical training. For psychiatric and neurological patients, supplying a saliva sample is less anxiety-provoking than providing a blood sample, and is less embarrassing than producing a urine specimen. The use of saliva as a biomaterial has been researched for the diagnosis of and greater understanding of several CNS conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, autism, and depression. Salivary biomarkers could be used to rule out nonpsychiatric conditions that are often mistaken for psychiatric/neurological conditions, such as fibromyalgia, and potentially to assess cognitive ability in individuals with compromised brain function.

The National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Clinical Science Subject Examinations (subject exams) are commonly used, but an integrated examination like the NBME Comprehensive Clinical Science Examination (CCSE) may be better suited for LICs. This study examined the comparability of the CCSE and five commonly required subject exams.\nIn 2009-2010, third-year medical students in rotation-based clerkships at the University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine completed subject exams in medicine, obstetrics-gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, and surgery for summative purposes following each rotation and a year-end CCSE for formative purposes. Data for 205 students were analyzed to determine the relationship between scores on the CCSE (and its five discipline subscales) and the five subject exams and the impact of clerkship rotation order.\nThe correlation between the CCSE score and the average score on the five subject exams was high (0.80-0.93). Four subject exam scores were significant predictors of the CCSE score, and scores on the subject exams explained 65%-87% of CCSE score variance. Scores on each subject exam-but not rotation order-were statistically significant in predicting corresponding CCSE discipline subscale scores.\nThe results provide evidence that these five subject exams and the CCSE measure similar constructs. This suggests that assessment of clerkship-year students' knowledge using the CCSE is comparable to assessment using this set of subject exams."}, {"Title": "Sudden cardiac death with stress and restraint: The association with sudden adult death syndrome, cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to report on sudden cardiac death (SCD) during or immediately after a stressful event in a predominately young cohort.\nThis study used retrospective non-case-controlled analysis. A total of 110 cases of SCD in relation to a stressful event such as altercation (45%), physical restraint (31%) in police custody (10%), exams/school/job stress (7.27%), receiving bad news (4%), or a car accident without injuries (2.73%) were retrospectively investigated. The majority of the subjects experiencing SCD were male (80.91%). The mean age was 36\u2009\u00b1\u200916 years (range 5-82 years). Twenty-three cases (20.91%) were psychiatric patients on antipsychotic medication.\nFifty-three per cent of cases died with a negative autopsy and a morphologically normal heart, indicating sudden adult death which is linked to cardiac channelopathies predisposing to stress-induced SCD. Cardiomyopathy was found in 16 (14.5%) patients and coronary artery pathology in 19 (17%) patients, with atherosclerosis predominating in older patients.\nThis study highlights SCD during psychological stress, mostly in young males where the sudden death occurred in the absence of structural heart disease. This may reflect the proarrhythmic potential of high catecholamines on the structurally normal heart in those genetically predisposed because of cardiac channelopathy. Structural cardiomyopathies and coronary artery disease also feature prominently. Cases of SCD associated with altercation and restraint receive mass media attention especially when police/other governmental bodies are involved. This study highlights the rare but important risk of SCD associated with psychological stress and restraint in morphologically normal hearts and the importance of an expert cardiac opinion where prolonged criminal investigations and medico-legal issues often ensue."}, {"Title": "A Thorn in the Flesh?

Members of staff identify the care of mentally disordered offenders in general psychiatric units as either \"a parking space\" or a very difficult or frightening course, where staff members tend to behave like pleasers in order to avoid risks of conflict or physical violence. Either way, it seems hard to provide sufficient mental health care.\nNationwide training and teaching as well as knowledge exchange between specialized forensic psychiatry and general psychiatry are recommended.

This study therefore aimed to investigate prolonged episodes of mechanical restraint on forensic psychiatric inpatients. Documentary data from medical records were thematically analyzed. Results show that the reasons for prolonged episodes of mechanical restraint on forensic psychiatric inpatients can be characterized by multiple factors: \"confounding\" (behaviors associated with psychiatric conditions, substance abuse, medical noncompliance, etc.), \"risk\" (behaviors posing a risk for violence), and \"alliance parameters\" (qualities of the staff-patient alliance and the patients' openness to alliance with staff), altogether woven into a mechanical restraint spiral that in itself becomes a reason for prolonged mechanical restraint.

The object of this study was to assess the effectiveness of AMD documentation at a local Veterans Affairs Medical Center. AMD documentation was compared among three inpatient services: surgery, medicine, and psychiatry. Retrospective in nature, 594 inpatient cases were compared. Results revealed that, overall, the rate of AMD documentation was 37.7%. AMD documentation on surgery was statistically more frequent (45.6%) than for either medicine (33.2%) or psychiatry (34.5%). The difference between the numbers of days to AMD documentation for all three services was not statistically significant. While there was no statistically significant difference across gender, Caucasians had AMDs documented more frequently than African Americans (p < .001). Logistic regression reveals that social worker and physician intervention, not patient-specific variables, are the primary predictors of AMD incidence. Policy makers may need to consider the realities of hospital care, especially in emergency settings, and be more specific in the steps of implementation of the policy in the evenings, weekends, and holidays. True adherence to policy implementation may require hospital administrators to increase staff and educational efforts so that the concept of AMD communication and documentation is completely explained to all staff and patients. Policy should include an electronic record reminder that is renewed every 3 years and provisions for accommodating patients who arrive on weekends and holidays, with special awareness of the particular communication needs of minority groups.

However, new research on oxytocin has also uncovered a 'darker side', including oxytocin's possible role in social out-grouping and envy. Instead of a simple view of oxytocin as 'good' or 'bad', a more accurate depiction of oxytocin's role in social processing likely involves the presence of moderating factors. We review moderation effects in oxytocin and their implications for psychiatry. One implication is that, across diagnostic categories, oxytocin administration may have positive effects for patients with social cognitive deficits but negative effects for patients with social cognitive bias. We conclude that future intervention studies should use methods such as signal detection to measure both deficit and bias parameters of social cognition and to evaluate potential individual and contextual moderators both within and between psychiatric diagnoses in order to determine for whom oxytocin treatment may be beneficial and for whom it may actually be harmful."}, {"Title": "Can proteomics-based diagnostics aid clinical psychiatry?", "Abstract": "Despite major advances in infrastructure and instrumentation, proteomics-driven translational applications have not yet yielded the results that the scientific community has envisaged.

MiRNAs are predicted to target ~50% of all protein-coding genes and functional studies indicate that they participate in the regulation of almost every cellular process. They also play a key role in pathogenetic mechanisms underlying several diseases, e.g. cancer, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. Several miRNAs are expressed in the human brain where they contribute to equilibrium between maintenance and differentiation of neural stem cells. MiRNAs specific mechanisms of action and their roles in brain development and synaptic plasticity resulted in a great interest in the analysis of their potential role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Currently, schizophrenia is one of the fields in psychiatry where miRNAs have been most widely investigated. The understanding of miRNAs role in schizophrenia has been achieved through association, functional and expression profiling studies on post mortem brain and peripheral tissues. Several studies identified association between neuropsychiatric disorders and variants in miRNAs including variations in miRNA/primary-/precursor-miRNAs sequences, in miRNAs biogenesis machinery genes, in the 3'UTR of target genes and in miRNAs expression. In summary, there is growing evidence that miRNAs exert a crucial role in gene expression regulation in the central nervous system and are altered in the development, presentation and response to treatment of psychiatric disorders. In this review we summarize the most significant results of experimental studies aimed at highlighting the involvement of human miRNAs in schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Normal or abnormal? 'Normative uncertainty' in psychiatric practice.", "Abstract": "The 'multicultural clinical interaction' presents itself as a dilemma for the mental health practitioner. Literature describes two problematic areas where this issues emerges--how to make an adequate distinction between religious rituals and the rituals that may be symptomatic of 'obsessive compulsive disorder' (OCD), and how to differentiate 'normative' religious or spiritual beliefs, behaviours, and experiences from 'psychotic' illnesses. When it comes to understanding service user's 'idioms of distress', beliefs about how culture influences behaviour can create considerable confusion and 'normative uncertainty' for mental health practitioners. In the absence of clear diagnostic and assessment criteria on distinguishing between 'culture' and 'psychopathology', practitioners have had to rely on their own intuition and seek out possible 'strategies' or 'procedures' from a contradictory and cross-disciplinary evidence base. Decontextualisation of service users' experiences may result in the pathologisation of culturally 'normative' phenomenon, 'category fallacy' errors, and poor health care experiences and outcomes for service users.This paper situates this dilemma within a wider debate that has concerned both the biomedical and social sciences, namely, the unresolved question of 'normality' or 'abnormality'. Indeed, issues that arise from dilemmas surrounding the question of 'culture' or 'psychopathology' are intimately tied to wider cultural ideas about what is considered 'normal'. The disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, and medical anthropology have struggled to establish workable criteria against which to judge behaviour as 'normal', 'abnormal', or 'pathological'. Three models for understanding mental 'abnormality' are evident in 'transcultural psychiatry' (what is now commonly known as 'cultural psychiatry'), and these models have corresponded closely to the interpretive models used by anthropologists attempting to make sense of the apparent diversity of human societies. The three models of 'absolutism', 'universalism' and 'cultural relativism' have not only important consequences for the nature and conduct of research enquiry, but also have implications for how the dilemma of 'culture' or 'psychopathology' is attended to in clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Understanding the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in newly diagnosed adult patients in general practice: a UK database study.", "Abstract": "Adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been largely ignored in psychiatric and general practice guidance until recently. Adult ADHD has a high social and medical burden, but health care is not well described in the UK. The main study objective was to evaluate a primary care adult ADHD population in terms of prescribing and health care contact rates.\nThis was a retrospective observational study using data from the Clinical Practice Research Database from January 1, 2002 to July 31, 2011. Adult patients with an incident ADHD diagnosis or ADHD medication were identified as having been free of ADHD medication or diagnoses in the previous 2 years. Patients were followed for 12-24 months after diagnosis.\nOf the 663 patients with ADHD in the cohort, 54.1% were prescribed ADHD medication during the observation period. During the first 6 months, 34.2% of patients initiated methylphenidates and 14.0% atomoxetine. In total, 36.3% patients were referred to secondary care psychiatry during observation, with the remaining population (63.7%) never having a referral. Most of the referrals were before diagnosis in primary care. At the end of the observation period, 16.2% of patients were on antipsychotics, 17.3% hypnotics, and 34.8% antidepressants or anxiolytics; however, some patients appeared to be prescribed antipsychotic or antidepressant medications even if they did not have an observable diagnosis in their records. Health care contact rates (general practitioner or hospital) increased by 39.2% post-diagnosis (incidence rate ratio: 1.39; 95% confidence interval: 1.32, 1.47), which may be related to the need for medication monitoring and titration.\nThis study has shown in primary care that there is relatively low use of ADHD medication, low referrals into secondary care, high rates of usage of psychiatric non-ADHD medications for different indications, and an increasing burden in terms of health care contacts in adult ADHD patients post-diagnosis."}, {"Title": "Perspectives on reasons of medication nonadherence in psychiatric patients.", "Abstract": "This study was carried out to evaluate factors resulting in medication nonadherence within 6 months before admission to the psychiatric service of our hospital for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, depression, and other psychiatric diseases.\nTwo hundred and three patients admitted to the Psychiatry Service of the Medical Faculty were included in this study. Sociodemographic parameters and clinical findings within 6 months before admission and patients' views on reasons of medication nonadherence were examined.\nPatients were classified into four groups according to their diagnosis: bipolar disorder (n=68, 33.5%), schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (n=59, 29.1%), depression (n=39, 19.2%), and others (n=37, 18.2%). The ratio of medication nonadherence was higher in the bipolar disorder group when compared to the groups with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, depression, and other disorders (12.1%, 18.2%, and 24.2% vs 45.5%); however, the ratio of medication nonadherence was similar in schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, depression, and the others group.

Self-administrated questionnaires including the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Chinese version Psychological Capital Questionnaire, effort-reward-imbalance (ERI) scale and participants' basic characteristics were distributed to 500 psychiatrists from 10 psychiatric hospitals of 8 major cities in Liaoning province.

Hierarchical multiple regression analysis (HMR) was performed to explore the predictors of psychiatrists' HRQOL.\nThe mean (SD) scores of PCS and MCS among psychiatrists were 79.78 (16.55) and 71.50 (19.24) respectively. The mean (SD) of ERR were 0.777 (0.493), and 89 (23.9%) had ERR scores above 1 (ERR\u2009>\u20091).

For the sake of psychiatrists' HRQOL, the reduction of occupational stress should be implemented. The enhancement of PsyCap could be a new intervention strategy and should be paid attention to in improving HRQOL of psychiatrists. Proportionate occupational reward (money, esteem, career opportunities) to their high work demands, psychological counseling, and stress management courses should be provided to psychiatrists to improve their QOL. PsyCap, as a personal coping resource open to change, should be managed and developed among psychiatrists."}, {"Title": "[Cognitive deficits in unipolar major depression].", "Abstract": "Cognitive deficits are common symptom presentations in neurology and psychiatry. Cognitive symptoms during major depressive episodes cause subjective distress as well as difficulties during therapy and psychosocial reintegration.

Due to such an exclusive focus on the intra-psychic processes, besides the survivors' healing facilitated by cultural beliefs and symbols, their trauma-related distress associated with the cultural interpretation of loss is also generally ignored. This paper illustrates the utility of the social constructionist paradigm in understanding the survivors' experiences of suffering and healing within the cultural and socio-political context of violence through an ethnographic study among the poor farmers of Nandigram, India, inflicted by violence from the state government as it tried to forcibly acquire their land to build a chemical factory. How the traumatized selves experience intense distress resulting from disruptions to a sense of wholeness and how this wholeness may be reformulated through culturally valued beliefs are highlighted in the themes of suffering ('experience of PTSD symptoms', 'betrayed self', 'overwhelmed by loss', and 'biographical disruption') and healing ('moral re-affirmation', 'sense of togetherness', 'sense of security due to change in political environment') presented in the vignettes."}, {"Title": "The forensic psychiatric report.", "Abstract": "The construction of a written forensic report is a core component of forensic practice, demonstrating the evaluator's skill in conducting the evaluation and in communicating relevant information to the legal audience in an effective manner.

High quality forensic reports require careful preparation from the earliest stages of work on a case. They generally follow an expected structure, which permits the evaluator to provide all the data necessary to form a carefully reasoned opinion that addresses the legal questions posed. Formats and content of reports vary according to the type of case and the circumstances of the evaluation and so require flexibility within customary frameworks. The style and quality of writing are critical to the crafting of forensic reports.

We examine the theoretical and practical motivations underlying this approach, by analyzing the case of depressive disorders, as defined in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), and the related removal of the \"bereavement exclusion clause.\" We first explore the claim that DSM is atheoretical, observing that, far from being atheoretical, DSM adopts an implicit, biologically inspired view of the mind; we show that such a view leads to a sort of circularity in the definition of depressive disorders, in which psychopharmacology seems to play a key role. We then turn to further problems deriving from this position, analyzing the issue of placebo effects in the treatment of depressive disorders and the philosophical question of normative preconditions for psychopathological diagnosis. Finally, we address the issue of subjectivity, which, together with the related aspect of the subject's relational context, appears to be crucial to any scientific theorizing about mental disorders, despite DSM's attempt to exclude it. Our defense of a non-reductionist view of mental disorders, however, does not imply that we endorse any sort of metaphysical dualism, or anti-diagnostic or anti-psychiatric positions. On the contrary, we argue that the adoption of a reductionist position actually undermines the theoretical and clinical accuracy in explaining depressive disorders."}, {"Title": "Manganese and selenium concentrations in umbilical cord serum and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in childhood.", "Abstract": "Existing evidence on the effects of manganese and selenium during fetal life on neurodevelopmental disorders is inadequate.

An efficient treatment for schizophrenia was discovered only in 1952 with the introduction of chlorpromazine, a phenothiazine derivative. Fairly soon, antipsychotics became available as LAI. The first compounds were fluphenazine enanthate (1966) and decanoate (1968) whose development is attributed to G.R. Daniel, a medical director at Squibb & Sons. Other first-generation antipsychotics long-acting injections (FGA-LAIs) were introduced in a rapid succession in the 1960s and 1970s. FGA-LAIs made a key contribution to the development of community psychiatry. As neuroleptics emptied psychiatric hospitals, it was important to ensure that patients could be taken care of in outpatient facilities. FGA-LAIs prevented covert non-compliance. Compliance was further reinforced by the social and psychological support of patients. The introduction of second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) led to a loss of interest in FGA-LAIs. This is evidenced by a drop in the number of papers published on this topic. The interest in LAI was revived with the introduction of the first SGA-LAI in 2003. Four different preparations have been approved in the decade between 2003 and 2013. SGA-LAIs differ from FGA-LAIs in the technology that is used to produce the depot effect, and also in the treatment objectives. The rationale for using SGA-LAIs is not only to prevent relapses due to treatment interruption, but also to achieve more constant plasma levels in order to reduce side effects due to excessive plasma levels and loss of efficacy due to insufficient plasma levels. Also, treatment objectives are no longer limited to controlling acute symptoms. Treatment objectives now include the alleviation of negative symptoms and cognitive deficits that are key prognostic factors."}, {"Title": "The pharmacodynamic properties of lurasidone and their role in its antidepressant efficacy in bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "The treatment of bipolar depression is one of the most challenging issues in contemporary psychiatry. Currently only quetiapine, the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination and recently lurasidone are officially FDA-approved against this condition. The neurobiology of bipolar depression and the possible targets of bipolar antidepressant therapy remain elusive. The current study investigated whether the pharmacodynamic properties of lurasidone fit to a previously developed model which was the first to be derived on the basis of the strict combination of clinical and preclinical data with no input from theory or opinion. The authors performed a complete and systematic review of the literature to identify the pharmacodynamic properties of lurasidone. The original model suggests that a constellation of effects on different receptors are necessary but the serotonin reuptake inhibition does not seem to play a significant role for bipolar depression. On the contrary norepinephrine activity seems to be very important. Probably the early antidepressant effect can be achieved through an agonistic activity at 5HT-1A and antagonism at alpha1 noradrenergic and 5-HT2A receptors, but the presence of a norepinephrine reuptake inhibition is essential in order to sustain it. Overall the properties of lurasidone fit well the model and add to its validity. A point that needs clarification is norepinephrine reuptake inhibition which is not yet studied for lurasidone."}, {"Title": "Involuntary admission and treatment of patients with mental disorder.", "Abstract": "Despite the efforts of the World Health Organization to internationally standardize strategies for mental-health care delivery, the rules and regulations for involuntary admission and treatment of patients with mental disorder still differ markedly across countries.

Although the exact definition and psychological meaning attributed to self-harm has not been static over history, there is a clear thread that connects Western asylum psychiatrists' thinking about self-harm to the current stand-alone diagnostic category of NSSI. Nineteenth-century psychiatrists identified a clinically meaningful difference between self-harm with and without the intent to die, between self-injurers who were psychotic and those who were not, and between self-injurers who made a single, serious mutilation and those who repetitively self-injured without causing permanent bodily damage.

Understanding this is important in order to be able to support the professionals, to improve the quality of care, and to know in which way future ethics support services might be helpful.\nWithin a project on ethics, coercion and psychiatry, we executed a focus group interview study at seven departments with 65 health care professionals and managers. We performed a systematic and open qualitative analysis focusing on the question: 'How do health care professionals deal with ethical challenges?' We deliberately did not present a fixed definition or theory of ethical challenge.\nWe categorized relevant topics into three subthemes: 1) Identification and presence of ethical challenges; 2) What do the participants actually do when dealing with an ethical challenge?; and 3) The significance of facing ethical challenges. Results varied from dealing with ethical challenges every day and appreciating it as a positive part of working in mental health care, to experiencing ethical challenges as paralyzing burdens that cause a lot of stress and hinder constructive team cooperation. Some participants reported that they do not have the time and that they lack a specific methodology. Quite often, informal and retrospective ad-hoc meetings in small teams were organized. Participants struggled with what makes a challenge an ethical challenge and whether it differs from a professional challenge. When dealing with ethical challenges, a number of participants experienced difficulties handling disagreement in a constructive way. Furthermore, some participants plead for more attention for underlying intentions and justifications of treatment decisions.\nThe interviewed health care professionals dealt with ethical challenges in many different ways, often in an informal, implicit and reactive manner. This study revealed nine different categories of what health care professionals implicitly or explicitly conceive as 'ethical challenges'. Future research should focus on how ethics support services, such as ethics reflection groups or moral case deliberation, can be of help with respect to dealing with ethical challenges and value disagreements in a constructive way."}, {"Title": "Research by residents: obstacles and opportunities.", "Abstract": "As the psychiatric field continues to evolve in a world with nascent mobile technology (Hilty et al., 2014), novel neuroscience and genetic research, and new payment and care models (Fried et al., 2014) it is likely that the psychiatry residents learn today will not match what they will be practicing tomorrow.

Schematic beliefs have not previously been investigated in children with distressing unusual, or psychotic-like, experiences (UEDs). The aim of this study was firstly to investigate whether a measure of schematic beliefs, originally designed for adults with psychosis, was suitable for children; and secondly, to examine the association of childhood schematic beliefs with internalising and externalising problems and with UEDs.\nSixty-seven children aged 8-14 years, with emotional and behavioural difficulties, completed measures of UEDs, internalising (depression and anxiety), and externalising (conduct and hyperactivity-inattention) problems, together with the Brief Core Schema Scales (BCSS).\nThe BCSS was readily completed by participants, and scale psychometric properties were good. Children tended to view themselves and others positively. Internalising and externalising problems and UEDs were all associated with negative schematic beliefs; effect sizes were small to medium.\nSchematic beliefs in young people can be measured using the BCSS, and negative schematic beliefs are associated with childhood psychopathology and with UEDs. Schematic beliefs may therefore form a useful target in psychological interventions for young people with UEDs."}, {"Title": "\"I started to feel like a 'real doctor'\": medical students' reflections on their psychiatry clerkship.", "Abstract": "Medical students' reflective journals can be a rich source for understanding what students learn and think about during clinical rotations and can offer educators and mentors insight into students' professional identity formation.

Constant comparative method was employed to identify and quantify emergent themes and uncover relationships between these themes.\nThe most common \"unprompted\" themes that students reported were the recognition of the complexity of the illness condition and the fact that the psychiatric patient does not exist in a vacuum (52 %); an acknowledgement of one's respect for the struggle of patients with mental illness (49 %); an expressed or demonstrated empathy for patients (48 %); and a reduced skepticism of the biological basis of mental illness and efficacy of treatments (46 %).\nReflective exercises-along with quality mentorship-can be used to understand students' experience with clinical encounters, facilitate change, refine assumptions among students, and promote critical self-assessment and personal growth."}, {"Title": "[Seclusion in emergency psychiatry].", "Abstract": "In Norway, seclusion (also called \u00abshielding\u00bb or \u00abopen-area seclusion\u00bb) is often used as an intervention in inpatient psychiatric wards as a continuation of milieu therapy, but the method remains controversial in health policy. A psychiatrist or occasionally a psychologist is responsible for making a decision on seclusion pursuant to Section 4-3 of the Mental Health Care Act. Because of the uncertainty regarding the content and academic legitimacy of this model, we have undertaken a review of available literature on the justification, practical application and effect of the Norwegian tradition of seclusion.\nThe article is based on systematic searches in national and international databases for the years 1930-2013.\nThe seclusion method is closely associated with the development of psychiatric institutions, especially the establishment of emergency units and milieu therapy. The concept of seclusion covers a variety of approaches, and its knowledge base is generally poor. Clinical treatment studies are largely of older origin and most likely not descriptive of current practices. The absence of efficacy studies means that as of today, we have little knowledge on the benefits of using seclusion as treatment.\nWe detected a major discrepancy between the clinical ubiquity of the seclusion method and its knowledge basis.

Drawing upon psychological and critically applied medical anthropology, as well as contributions from philosophy on how classifications of people come into being and circulate, attention is paid to the multiple contradictions at work in diagnosing young people with mental disorders. A detailed examination of an exchange that occurred during one particular group therapy session is presented to demonstrate how psychiatric selves emerge in this environment when conventional labeling practices no longer suffice as an explanation of behavior. This turn to psychiatry reveals both the salience of and confusion around mental health treatment and diagnosis among adolescents, opens up the distinctions young people make between \"real selves\" and \"medicated selves,\" and invokes the possibility of psychiatric disorder as a means to both forgive and discredit."}, {"Title": "Evolutionary behavioral genetics.", "Abstract": "We describe the scientific enterprise at the intersection of evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics-a field that could be termed <i>Evolutionary Behavioral Genetics</i>-and how modern genetic data is revolutionizing our ability to test questions in this field.

Qualitative analysis indicated three major themes (information, transition, and behaviour) and five overlapping subthemes (positive information sharing and consultation, concerns and anxieties about lack of information, life change and opportunity, home and sense of belonging, and potential conflict). Outcome data indicated little obvious change between first and second interviews. Expressed concerns of patients about transition were largely about tangible and practical issues, including changes to rules, including smoking and prohibited items. The results highlight the need for the development of supportive patient-inclusion strategies, consistent and transparent communication processes, and a published timeframe during the planning and implementation phases of all types of transitional moves, including the side-to-side transfer of residents between accommodation buildings."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry resident-led tutorials increase medical student knowledge and improve national board of medical examiners shelf exam scores.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry residents have tremendous potential as educators.

A key social context for individuals with psychosis is the therapeutic relationship. As part of a trial of joint crisis planning in England, this qualitative study aimed to determine the mechanism through which joint crisis planning might affect the therapeutic relationship. Results suggest that routine processes in mental health care are affected by policy and organizational requirements for risk mitigation-aspects that undermine person-centered approaches. In contrast, strong therapeutic relationships are characterized by individualized care and reliable and respectful treatment. The Joint Crisis Plan intervention partially succeeded in reducing contextual influences on routine role enactments, facilitating the demonstration of respect and improving the therapeutic relationship."}, {"Title": "Factors affecting recruitment into psychiatry: a canadian experience.", "Abstract": "There is a projected shortage of psychiatrists in Canada in forthcoming years.

Relevant data were obtained from the Canadian Resident Matching Service. Statistics were performed using v12 STATA program, and significance was set at a p value of <0.05.\nMedical student enrollment ranged from 54 to 266 students (mean = 158 \u00b1 16). Of these students, 4.9 \u00b1 0.6 % ranked psychiatry as their first choice for residency. Final match results yielded similar numbers at 5.0 \u00b1 0.6 %. Ten out of 17 programs filled all psychiatry residency positions, whereas the remaining 7 programs had vacancy rates from 5 to 100 % (mean = 43.4 \u00b1 15.1 %).

It is known to have potent effects on the central nervous system glutamatergic system, in particular blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Based upon pre-clinical evidence of involvement of the glutamatergic system in mood disorders, studies have been undertaken to test the antidepressant properties of ketamine. Several well-controlled studies, along with open-label case series, have established that ketamine can have rapid antidepressant effects. Additionally, data exist showing benefits of ketamine in post-traumatic stress disorder as well as obsessive compulsive disorder. However, improvements in these conditions tend to be short-lived with single infusions of ketamine. Of concern, ketamine has been associated with neurotoxicity in pre-clinical rodent models and is well-known to cause psychotomimetic effects and addiction in humans. While ketamine has been proven safe for use in sub-anesthetic doses administered once or a few times, the safety profile of prolonged use has not been established.

Meta-analyses based on small proof-of-principle trials suggest efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of negative symptoms and call for adequately powered multicenter trials. This study evaluated the efficacy of 10-Hz rTMS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for the treatment of predominant negative symptoms in schizophrenia.\nA multicenter randomized, sham-controlled, rater-blinded and patient-blinded trial was conducted from 2007-2011. Investigators randomly assigned 175 patients with schizophrenia with predominant negative symptoms and a high-degree of illness severity into two treatment groups. After a 2-week pretreatment phase, 76 patients were treated with 10-Hz rTMS applied 5 days per week for 3 weeks to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (added to the ongoing treatment), and 81 patients were subjected to sham rTMS applied similarly.\nThere was no statistically significant difference in improvement in negative symptoms between the two groups at day 21 (p = .53, effect size = .09) or subsequently through day 105. Also, symptoms of depression and cognitive function showed no differences in change between groups. There was a small, but statistically significant, improvement in positive symptoms in the active rTMS group (p = .047, effect size = .30), limited to day 21.\nApplication of active 10-Hz rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was well tolerated but was not superior compared with sham rTMS in improving negative symptoms; this is in contrast to findings from three meta-analyses."}, {"Title": "Patient-provider communication over social media: perspectives of adolescents with psychiatric illness.", "Abstract": "Social media is an increasingly dominant platform for communication, especially among adolescents. Statements from professional bodies and a growing body of empirical evidence support a role for social media in improving provider-patient interactions. In psychiatry, particular concerns exist about the suitability of this style of communication. Very limited data are available exploring how patients would like to incorporate social media into their communication with their psychiatric providers.\nWe conducted a qualitative study with 20 adolescents attending the Yale Psychiatric Hospital Intensive Outpatient Programme. Interviews were analysed using inductive thematic analysis.\nParticipants highlighted how social media could allow for constant access to a mental health provider, provide a less anxiety-provoking mode of communication, and allow for them to be monitored in a more on-going fashion. However, participants also identified many potential risks associated with these applications, including the potential for anxiety if a provider was not able to respond immediately, and a sense that online interactions would be less rich overall.\nOur findings suggest that adolescents are open to the idea of communicating with mental health providers over social media and are able to describe a number of instances where this could be of value. The risks participants described, as well as concerns raised by existing literature, indicate the need for further work and protocol development in order for social media to be a feasible tool for communication between providers and adolescents with psychiatric illness."}, {"Title": "Is there a \"metabolic-mood syndrome\"? A review of the relationship between obesity and mood disorders.", "Abstract": "Obesity and mood disorders are highly prevalent and co-morbid. Epidemiological studies have highlighted the public health relevance of this association, insofar as both conditions and its co-occurrence are associated with a staggering illness-associated burden. Accumulating evidence indicates that obesity and mood disorders are intrinsically linked and share a series of clinical, neurobiological, genetic and environmental factors. The relationship of these conditions has been described as convergent and bidirectional; and some authors have attempted to describe a specific subtype of mood disorders characterized by a higher incidence of obesity and metabolic problems. However, the nature of this association remains poorly understood. There are significant inconsistencies in the studies evaluating metabolic and mood disorders; and, as a result, several questions persist about the validity and the generalizability of the findings. An important limitation in this area of research is the noteworthy phenotypic and pathophysiological heterogeneity of metabolic and mood disorders. Although clinically useful, categorical classifications in both conditions have limited heuristic value and its use hinders a more comprehensive understanding of the association between metabolic and mood disorders. A recent trend in psychiatry is to move toward a domain specific approach, wherein psychopathology constructs are agnostic to DSM-defined diagnostic categories and, instead, there is an effort to categorize domains based on pathogenic substrates, as proposed by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC). Moreover, the substrates subserving psychopathology seems to be unspecific and extend into other medical illnesses that share in common brain consequences, which includes metabolic disorders. Overall, accumulating evidence indicates that there is a consistent association of multiple abnormalities in neuropsychological constructs, as well as correspondent brain abnormalities, with broad-based metabolic dysfunction, suggesting, therefore, that the existence of a \"metabolic-mood syndrome\" is possible. Nonetheless, empirical evidence is necessary to support and develop this concept. Future research should focus on dimensional constructs and employ integrative, multidisciplinary and multimodal approaches."}, {"Title": "[Hypersexuality in Parkinson's disease. Advantage of the presence of the entourage for medical assessment].", "Abstract": "To improve the management of hypersexuality caused by antiparkinsonian treatment and its psychopathological implications in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). If hypersexuality is a classic form of impulse control disorder (ICD) observed in PD, its rate is certainly underestimated.\nWe have proposed to meet patients with Parkinson's disease, referred by the neurology department of Lille University Hospital, for detection or suspicion of hypersexuality, in the presence of their spouse. The session consisted of an interview conducted by our psychiatry team. This evaluation was conducted between January 1 and August 31, 2011. Nine patients were referred to our service, 7 agreed to meet us, 6 of them with their spouse.\nAn interview in the presence of the spouse has improved hypersexuality screening and information given to the patient and his close contacts regarding the side effects of treatment, and particularly the occurrence of hypersexuality. It also highlighted the various expressions of these behavioral changes, often minimized by patients, as spouses had great difficulty dealing with this. It helped them to improve verbal communication and, therefore, to be more informative concerning sexual behavior changes in connection with the treatment and its management. Finally, it has enabled improved support for secondary consequences of this impulse control disorder, such as guilt, jealousy or shame. Our interest has also focused on the impact of this hypersexuality on patients' families. Among the six sets partners, four had symptoms requiring specific psychiatric care: depression, suicidal intention or post-traumatic stress disorder.\nHypersexuality seems underestimated in patients receiving antiparkinsonian treatment. This underestimation is probably linked to some defense mechanisms such as denial or minimization, but also to the feelings generated by these behavioral problems, such as shame or guilt. On the other hand, some patients do not experience stress related behavioral changes (even though the family may complain). Systematic partner interview could be a solution to improving this screening."}, {"Title": "Substance use disorders in individuals with mild to borderline intellectual disability: current status and future directions.", "Abstract": "Knowledge regarding substance use (SU) and substance use disorder (SUD) in individuals with mild to borderline intellectual disabilities (ID) has increased over the last decade, but is still limited.

In this selective and critical review, we provide an overview of the current status of SU(D) in ID and explore insights on the conceptualisation of SUD from other fields such as addiction medicine and general psychiatry. SU(D) turns out to be a chronic, multifaceted brain disease that is intertwined with other physical, psychiatric and social problems. These insights have implications for practices, policies and future research with regard to the prevalence, screening, assessment and treatment of SUD.

When agomelatine was administered as an additional treatment, drug-induced excessive sweating was observed after a daily intake of 90 mg of duloxetine hydrochloride and 25 mg of agomelatine. After thorough discussion, it was decided not to rechallenge with agomelatine because of the serious adverse effect. After agomelatine discontinuation and switching to trazodone, symptoms immediately improved.\nDuloxetine hydrochloride-induced sweating has been reported frequently, but excessive sweating induced by agomelatine and duloxetine hydrochloride has not been reported in the literature. The adverse effect was determined by a clinical pharmacist using the Naranjo probability scale and was probably associated with agomelatine use (6 points) and possibly associated with duloxetine hydrochloride use (4 points). The exact mechanism for this adverse effect in this patient is not known, but we believe that a pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction between agomelatine and duloxetine hydrochloride had occurred.\nSuch a case has not yet been described in literature; however, an adverse effect associated with drug-drug interaction can occur, as this report clearly demonstrates. The benefits of this antidepressant combination need to be carefully balanced with the risks associated with its use. This case report also highlights the increased potential for adverse reactions when prescribing antidepressant combinations and importance of clinical pharmacists' involvement in the psychiatric patients' pharmacotherapy."}, {"Title": "[The contribution of neuroscience to the concept of mental disorder].", "Abstract": "In this article the contribution of neuroscience to the concept of mental disorder is discussed against the background of biological psychiatry and philosophy of mind.\nPsychiatric nosology is confronted by similar challenges as every general nosology.

In the case of mental disorders, a further issue is that every nosology has to take a stance about what mental processes actually are. In this article, the disorder concepts of the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5) and of the research domain criteria (RDoC) approach of the National Institute of Mental Health are explained and discussed. Furthermore, it is argued that a sound psychiatric nosology should not be purely descriptive but should also take the causal mechanisms of disorders into account. A recent suggestion, the theory of mechanistic property clusters, is introduced. Taking recent discussion on the philosophy of mind into account, it becomes apparent that the obvious assumption that mental disorders are (nothing more than) disorders of the brain might not be correct: at least this has been suggested by the theory of situated cognition.

Mania is a distinct period of abnormal and sustained elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and increase in goal-directed activity or energy that lasts at least 1 week and is present for most of each day. Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic approved for the treatment of bipolar depression and mania. For the treatment of acute mania, a dose of 600 to 800 mg/day is recommended. There has been concern of potential induction or worsening of hypomanic or manic symptoms at low doses via the ratio of 5HT2A/D2 receptor antagonism, which at lower doses favors greater 5HT2A receptor blockade and thus increases dopamine concentrations. This article describes a case report of hypomania worsening to mania with psychotic features in a drug-na\u00efve patient who was started on low-dose quetiapine.

Impairments in social functioning are seen in many types of psychopathology, negatively affecting the lives of psychiatric patients and those around them. Yet the neurobiology underlying abnormal social interaction remains unclear. As an example of human social neuroscience research with relevance to biological psychiatry and clinical psychopharmacology, this commentary discusses published experimental studies involving manipulation of the human brain serotonin system that included assessments of social behavior. To date, these studies have mostly been laboratory-based and included computer tasks, observations by others, or single-administration self-report measures. Most laboratory measures used so far inform about the role of serotonin in aspects of social interaction, but the relevance for real-life interaction is often unclear. Few studies have used naturalistic assessments in real life. We suggest several laboratory methods with high ecological validity as well as ecological momentary assessment, which involves intensive repeated measures in naturalistic settings.

LCA-assigned Class I participants reported more depressive symptoms, had more distressing episodes and more lasting consequences, were more likely to view their depression as 'like a disease', and as being both disproportionately more severe and persistent in relation to any antecedent stressor. Validation involved comparison of LCA assignment with DSM-IV diagnosis for their most severe depressive episode. Of those assigned to Class I, 89% had a DSM diagnosis of melancholic, psychotic or bipolar depression.

Moral engagement is intrinsic to psychiatric practice, particularly when psychiatrists engage issues such as combat trauma in which patients' moral self-evaluations are relevant to the perpetuation of psychological distress. Relative to technical models of practice, however, the space of moral engagement and discernment conveys risk for psychiatrists as it is less \"scientific,\" more prone to exploitation and abuse, and the occasion for social-political critiques of psychiatry. Three prevalent forms of psychiatric dualism, each manifest in the care of combat veterans, seem to allow psychiatrists to avoid this contested moral space: dualism of the self and the self's body, dualism of the self and the self's quantifiable experience and behavior, and dualism of the self and the self's \"values.\" Each of these dualisms is alluring but ultimately unable to protect psychiatrists from the space of moral engagement. Psychiatrists must rather cultivate practices for inhabiting that space in a morally transparent, self-questioning, and responsible way."}, {"Title": "A role for the BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism in schizophrenia? A comprehensive review.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is believed to arise from complex gene-environment interactions. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in neuronal development, differentiation and plasticity. A functional single nucleotide polymorphism that results in a valine (Val) to methionine (Met) substitution at codon 66 (Val66Met) results in the aberrant sorting and release of mature BDNF through the activity-dependent secretion pathway. The Val66Met polymorphism has been linked to impaired neurocognitive function in healthy adults, and identified as a locus of risk for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the relationship between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and schizophrenia, integrating evidence from the fields of genetic epidemiology, clinical psychiatry, behavioral neuroscience and neuroimaging. We argue that while the Val66Met polymorphism may not be a major risk-conferring agent for the development of schizophrenia per se, there is mounting evidence that the polymorphism modulates a range of clinical features of the illness, including age of onset, symptoms, therapeutic responsiveness, neurocognitive function and brain morphology."}, {"Title": "Experimental model for ELF-EMF exposure: Concern for human health.", "Abstract": "Low frequency (LF) electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are abundantly present in modern society and in the last 20\u00a0years the interest about the possible effect of extremely low frequency (ELF) EMFs on human health has increased progressively. Epidemiological studies, designed to verify whether EMF exposure may be a potential risk factor for health, have led to controversial results. The possible association between EMFs and an increased incidence of childhood leukemia, brain tumors or neurodegenerative diseases was not fully elucidated. On the other hand, EMFs are widely used, in neurology, psychiatry, rheumatology, orthopedics and dermatology, both in diagnosis and in therapy. In vitro studies may help to evaluate the mechanism by which LF-EMFs affect biological systems. In vitro model of wound healing used keratinocytes (HaCaT), neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) as a model for analysis of differentiation, metabolism and functions related to neurodegenerative processes, and monocytic cell line (THP-1) was used as a model for inflammation and cytokines production, while leukemic cell line (K562) was used as a model for hematopoietic differentiation. MCP-1, a chemokine that regulates the migration and infiltration of memory T cells, natural killer (NK), monocytes and epithelial cells, has been demonstrated to be induced and involved in various diseases. Since, varying the parameters of EMFs different effects may be observed, we have studied MCP-1 expression in HaCaT, SH-SY5Y, THP-1 and K562 exposed to a sinusoidal EMF at 50\u00a0Hz frequency with a flux density of 1\u00a0mT (rms). Our preliminary results showed that EMF-exposure differently modifies the expression of MCP-1 in different cell types. Thus, the MCP-1 expression needs to be better determined, with additional studies, with different parameters and times of exposure to ELF-EMF."}, {"Title": "Can psychedelic compounds play a part in drug dependence therapy?", "Abstract": "After a 40-year hiatus there is now a revisiting of psychedelic drug therapy throughout psychiatry, with studies examining the drugs psilocybin, ketamine, ibogaine and ayahuasca in the treatment of drug dependence.

All patients were evaluated during the initial 3 days of their admission using the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS),the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) and a sociodemographic questionnaire. The factor structures of the psychopathological scale items were determined with factor analyses and based on the factor loadings, cluster analyses were performed. The relationships among the clusters and the clinical variables were then evaluated.\nThe factor analyses generated three factors: increased psychomotor activity, dysphoria, and psychosis. A hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to the three factor loadings, and revealed that factor 1 (increased psychomotor activity) was high in cluster 1 and that the effects of factors 2 (dysphoria) and 3 (psychosis) were high in cluster 2. Within cluster 1 (Psychomotor elevation), 39% of patients were diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder while 31.6% of patients in the cluster 2 (dysphoric-psychotic) were diagnosed with both alcohol and cannabis use disorders. Within cluster 2 (dysphoric-psychotic), 47.4% of patients had one suicide attempt and 21.1% of patients had two or more attempts during their lifetime.\nThere was a significant difference in the presence of SUDs between patients with psychomotor elevation and patients in dysphoric-psychotic cluster. This may be point out that pure manic patients with BD self-medicate using the sedative effects of alcohol and the causal relationship between cannabis and psychosis. Using a dimensional approach to study BD may enhance detection of the biological correlates of BD and improve the treatment and outcomes of the disorder."}, {"Title": "Ready, set, relax: biofeedback-assisted relaxation training (BART) in a pediatric psychiatry consultation service.", "Abstract": "Biofeedback-assisted relaxation training (BART) can treat several common pediatric presentations, including chronic pain and anxiety.

In addition to heart rate variability and skin temperature data collection, participants completed the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale and a brief mood/affective state rating scale (Youth Feelings Scale) before and after the BART sessions.\nA total of 152 sessions were conducted with 66 patients across 11 referring services. BART was successfully used 61% of the time on the medical floor with common barriers involving patient unavailability or refusal. The patients completed an average of 1.57 sessions per admission. The post-BART session pain and mood ratings significantly improved over the presession ratings. Patients with both pain and anxiety reported the greatest changes across sessions in comparison with those with only pain or anxiety.

Poor outcomes include a high frequency of criminal acts, imprisonments, and repeat offenses. This critical review of the international literature examined several aspects of the complex relationship between individuals with bipolar disorder and the criminal justice system: risk factors for criminal acts, features of bipolar patients' incarceration, and their postrelease trajectories.\nPublications were obtained from the PubMed and Google Scholar electronic databases by using the following MeSH headings: prison, forensic psychiatry, criminal law, crime, and bipolar disorder.\nAmong patients with bipolar disorder, the frequency of violent criminal acts is higher than in the general population (odds ratio [OR]=2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.8-4.3). The frequency is higher among patients with bipolar disorder and a comorbid substance use disorder than among those without either disorder (OR=10.1, CI=5.3-19.2). As a result, the prevalence of bipolar disorder among prisoners is high (2%-7%). In prison, patients' bipolar disorder symptoms can complicate their relationship with prison administrators, leading to an increased risk of multiple incarcerations. Moreover, the risk of suicide increases for these prisoners.\nCriminal acts are common among patients with bipolar disorder and are often associated with problems such as addiction. Thus it is important to improve the diagnosis and treatment of inmates with bipolar disorder."}, {"Title": "The prestige model of spectrum bipolarity.", "Abstract": "Because affective pathogenesis is a hard problem for psychiatry, it behoves researchers to develop and test novel models of causality. We examine the notion that the adaptive drive to social investment - prestige - provides clues to the bipolar spectrum. A seven node bipolar spectrum is proposed, based on a putative gradient of \"bipolarity\". It is conceived that this gradient may correlate with the drive to social investment (prestige). In order to test this hypothesis with proof of concept data, a case control study categorised 228 subjects into a seven node bipolar spectrum. Whilst controlling for mood elevation and depression, differences in strategic prestige (leadership) motivation (MSPM) between spectrum groups were examined. The bipolar I (S1) node had a greater strategic prestige (leadership) motivation score than the controls (S7) by 21.17 points, 95% CI [8.16, 34.18], p<.001, d=1.05, while the bipolar II (S2) node was higher than the control group by 16.73 points, 95% CI [0.92, 32.54], p=.030, d=0.84. Whilst the pseudounipolar (S3) node (those with depression and bipolar family histories; n=17) had only a marginally statistical difference in MSPM compared to controls (p=.051), the mean difference (16.98) and d value (0.86) indicated an elevated MSPM level. Prestige (leadership) motivation score positively correlated with dimensional lifetime bipolarity (Mood Disorder Questionnaire) score (rp=0.47), supporting the spectrum prestige motivation gradient notion. Evidence is presented for a genetic disposition to elevated strategic prestige (leadership) motivation. Sensitivity to Social Inclusion (MSIS), Contingency of Self-Worth (CSW.av) and tension significantly predicted strategic prestige (leadership) motivation (MSPM) score in a multiple regression. - suggesting that a vulnerability of the social self may be a feature of bipolar disorders. The prestige model of spectrum bipolarity offers a new conceptualisation of affective disorders and has received preliminary support."}, {"Title": "Suicidal behaviours in adjustment disorder and depressive episode.", "Abstract": "Little is known about suicidal ideation and behaviours in adjustment disorder (AD). In this paper we sought to examine the variables independently associated with suicidal ideation and behaviour in patients diagnosed with AD or depressive (DE) episode among psychiatric outpatients and in liaison psychiatry.\n370 patients who were referred to the liaison psychiatry services (including those seen in the Emergency Department) at 3 Dublin hospitals, and were clinically diagnosed with either DE or AD, based on the ICD 10 diagnostic criteria, were recruited to the study. We examined their demographic and clinical characteristics, and the associations between these and suicidal ideation and behaviour on multivariate analysis.\nYounger age, single marital status, and greater severity of depressive symptoms were significantly associated with suicidality across both diagnoses. On multivariate analysis, greater severity of depressive symptoms was associated with suicidality in those with AD (p=0.012) and DE (p=0.009). Those with AD exhibited suicidality at lower symptom scores than did those with DE but in both groups it still occurred at the highest level of severity. There were differences in the objective circumstances measure of suicide intent.\nWe used clinical diagnosis rather as the main diagnostic classification. The generalisability of this paper may be limited to consultation-liaison psychiatry settings, where suicidal ideation and behaviours are common.\nSuicidality in AD and DE has broadly similar risk factors but differ in aspects of suicide intent.

The results have been somewhat conflicting, which could be due to differences both in patient sample characteristics and in PET methods. In particular, further work is needed to address both methodological and biological sources of variability in TSPO levels, a process in which the use of animal models and small animal PET systems can be a valuable tool. Given this development, PET studies of immune activation have the potential to further increase our understanding of disease mechanisms in psychiatric disorders, which is a requisite in the search for new treatment approaches.

Using automated analysis, transcripts of interviews were evaluated for semantic and syntactic features predicting later psychosis onset. Speech features were fed into a convex hull classification algorithm with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to assess their predictive value for psychosis outcome. The canonical correlation between the speech features and prodromal symptom ratings was computed.\nDerived speech features included a Latent Semantic Analysis measure of semantic coherence and two syntactic markers of speech complexity: maximum phrase length and use of determiners (e.g., which). These speech features predicted later psychosis development with 100% accuracy, outperforming classification from clinical interviews. Speech features were significantly correlated with prodromal symptoms.\nFindings support the utility of automated speech analysis to measure subtle, clinically relevant mental state changes in emergent psychosis.

Therefore, we investigated factors associated with dropping out of school with the purpose of creating a strategy to improve the academic outcomes of students who regularly seek psychiatric consultation.\nWe investigated undergraduate students who received consultation at Tsukuba University's Health Services Center Psychiatry Department and whose academic outcomes between the 2004 and 2013 academic years were known.\nAcademic outcomes were obtained from Tsukuba University's grade management system by permission of the authority. The students were divided into either a graduate or dropout group depending on their academic outcomes. The medical records for both groups were retrospectively investigated, and factors that were predicted to affect academic outcomes were assessed using statistical methods.\nThe dropout group was younger in grade and had a greater severity of illness at initial consultation. Moreover, this group had a greater number of consultation visits, showed less cooperation with the instructor in charge, had a significantly longer duration of social with drawal and temporary leave of absence from school, and had a significantly greater number of students with grade retention. When a time factor was incorporated in the analysis, the presence of grade retention/temporary leave of absence from school and social withdrawal was significantly correlated with dropping out of school.\nIt was revealed that not only the mental disorder itself, but also psychosocial severity and the maladjusted state that occur secondary to such mental disorder influence academic outcomes. These results indicated that in order to improve academic outcomes, it is necessary not only to appropriately treat the disorder, but to also provide university community support for social maladjusted states of the students in psychiatric treatments, such as social withdrawal, educational support for daily living, individual support for daily living, and academic support, through cooperation with the educational organization."}, {"Title": "[The systematics of psychogenic depressions (reactions of complicated grief)].", "Abstract": "Reactive depression provoked by the loss of loved ones is a controversial problem of modern psychiatry based on the diametrically opposite conceptions.

Based on the advances of basic sciences over the last two decades, new knowledge on the risk factors for NDD and molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis are obtained. It has been shown that the accelerated process of neuronal death which is the main cause of NDD development begins long before the appearance of clinical symptoms. The first symptoms appeared only after the death of most specific regulatory neurons and exhaustion of brain compensatory reserve. Only at that time, one can make the diagnosis and start traditional treatment of patients that accounts for the extremely low efficacy of the latter. Currently, complex preclinical diagnosis based on the identification of relatively specific clinical precursors and peripheral biomarkers has been developing. Development of preclinical diagnosis and preventive treatment is a strategic issue of modern neurology and psychiatry.

Within HDD (n=9) and LDD (n=13) departments, two separate logistic regression models, using MHN or PN as an endpoint, were fitted using available sociodemographic data. Model validation was performed using 2007 census data. Overall accuracy was evaluated using average residuals (AR) calculated within density stratum.\nIn LDD and HDD respectively, 26.6% and 28.7% of persons had MHN and 9.8% and 11.3% had PN. In LDD, housing type, age, employment, living alone, housing support, and household size predicted MHN and PN. In HDD, housing type, living alone, household size, living in a marriage/partnership, and duration of dwelling habitation predicted MHN and PN. Predictions were more accurate in HDD, in which the AR was 30% lower for MHN and 40% lower for PN. Predictions were less accurate when using census data, yet they were consistently better in HDD.\nSociodemographic indicators from either survey or census data may be useful in predicting MHN and PN in high-density settings.

Monitoring is based on the detection of these abnormalities and their early management. The organization of this monitoring system is based on a network of doctors, mostly pediatricians, trained regularly. The objective of this review was to assess the resources, means, and results of 10 years of follow-up.\nThe Pays de la Loire network includes 24 maternity wards and 13 neonatal departments. Annual admissions are around 5000 newborns to approximately 45,000 annual births. Upon discharge of newborns, born prematurely at 34 weeks of gestation (WG) or less, or term infants with neurological problems, parents are asked to have their child monitored by a referring doctor. During the consultation, a reference document is filled out by the doctor and sent to the project manager for data collection and specific compensation for private practitioners. Standardized questionnaires were used such as the ASQ (Ages and Stage Questionnaire) completed by parents, the developmental quotient (DQ) with the L\u00e9zine Brunet-Revised test (BLR), the intelligence quotient (IQ) with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WIPPSI III) completed by psychologists employed in the network, and a questionnaire completed by the teacher at 5 years of age.\nThe network started on 1st March 2003, and 28th February 2013, after 10 years of inclusion, 10,800 children had been included. This population accounts for 2.4% of all annual births: 1.1% were included for prematurity less than 33 weeks and 0.25% were term-born infants. The characteristics of children are presented with gestational age, birth weight, and obstetric and neonatal pathologies. The percentage of these children followed was 80% at 2 years and 63% at 5 years. At 2 years, the results are presented according to gestational age with approximately 60% of children without disabilities at 25-26 WG, 73% at 27-28 WG, 77% at 29-30 WG, and 86% at 31-32 WG. Absorptions are diverse and vary according to the age of the child with physical therapy, psychomotor skill work, speech therapy, hearing and vision consultations, and psychology/psychiatry. Assessment tools were refined by specific analyses: the ASQ 24 months (completed by parents) was deemed valid and predictive with respect to IQ (abandoned in 2012), and the grid completed by the teacher was found to predict abnormalities in 5 years.\nThe Pays de la Loire monitoring network has met its initial objective, namely to detect disabilities early and provide practical help to parents in a population of vulnerable children. Benefits for professionals and other children not followed in the network were observed, with an increase in pediatricians' skills. The benefits of the evaluation results are more difficult to assess with the care than neonatal care in obstetrics. The sustainability of such a network seems assured for healthcare professionals, provided that funding is maintained by the health authorities."}, {"Title": "Novel investigational therapeutics for panic disorder.", "Abstract": "Panic disorder (PD) is a common disabling anxiety disorder associated with relevant social costs. Effective anti-panic medications exist but have several drawbacks. From a clinical perspective, there is still a strong unmet need for more effective, faster acting and more tolerable therapeutic treatments.\nThe authors review the available results on novel mechanism-based anti-panic drugs that are under investigation in animal studies up to Phase II studies. The preclinical studies investigated include: the modulators of the glutamate/orexin/cannabinoid systems, corticotrophin-releasing factor 1 (CRF1)/arginine vasopressine V\u2081B/angiotensin II receptor antagonists and neuropeptide S. The Phase I/II studies investigated include: the modulators of the glutamate system, isoxazoline derivative, translocator protein (18 kDa) ligands and CRF1/neurokinin receptor antagonists.\nThere has been little progress in recent times. However, glutamate- and orexin-related molecular targets may represent very promising opportunities for treating panic attacks. Very preliminary findings suggest that the antagonists of CRF1 and A-II receptors may have anti-panic properties. However, new medications for PD are far from being implemented in clinical use. The reasons are multiple, including: the heterogeneity of the disorder, the translational validity of animal models and the insufficient use of biomarkers in preclinical/clinical studies. Nevertheless, biomarker-based strategies, pharmacogenomics, 'personalized psychiatry' and the NIH's Research Domain Criteria approach could help to remove those obstacles limiting drug development."}, {"Title": "[Body dysmorphic disorder].", "Abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a relatively common disorder with a point prevalence of 0.7-2.4 %.

Increasing prescription numbers contrast with the uncertainties of safety and efficacy issues. The lack of clinical (authorization) trials often implies a non- age-specific use of drugs. However, young patients show particular metabolic conditions and a higher vulnerability for adverse drug reactions. Thus it seems mandatory to create age-specific pharmacological data about efficacy and safety of psychotropic drug use in minors. Legislation authorities became aware of this situation and introduced European and national scientific pharmacovigilance regulations and programmes accordingly in order to continuously evaluate the benefit-risk-ratio, detect, collect, minimize, and prevent adverse effects of drugs by appropriate measures, e.g., therapeutic drug monitoring. In this paper the principles and needs of pharmacovigilance in child and adolescent psychiatry are discussed.

Those working at the out-of-hours clinics had less work experience and fewer had prior knowledge of the patients they committed. About half the doctors felt it was difficult to apply the medico-legal criteria. More than half had felt pressured/advised to refer the patient to hospital and about half had felt pressured/advised to do so involuntarily.\nWhile doctors considering the commitment of psychiatric patients are presumed to make independent assessments of patients based on medico-legal criteria, this study suggests that many doctors feel pressured to commit.\nThe assessment made by doctors who refer patients involuntarily to psychiatric hospital may be influenced by other parts of the health service, the patient's family and the police.

The mean time lag between initial parental concern and the first visit to a hospital was 2.6\u00a0years. Risk factors for a longer time lag include the young age of a child, behavioral problems of the child, lower maternal education, difficulty in determining appropriate medical institution, referral route, and the distance from home to the hospital.

This came as a surprise, since the vast majority of psychiatrists in Pelotas draw on psychoanalytic theory and approach pharmaceutical use, especially for children and adolescents, in a consciously tempered way. Drawing from a longitudinal ethnographic sub-study, part of a larger 1982 birth cohort study, this paper follows the circuitous trajectories of emergent pharma-patterns among \"shantytown\" youth over a ten-year period, exploring the thickly layered and often moralized contingencies in which psychodynamic psychiatrists' intention to resist excessive pharmaceuticalization both succeed and crumble. I juxtapose these trajectories with the growing salience of an \"anti-biologizing\" explanatory framework that psychiatrists and researchers are using to pre-empt the kind of diagnostics-driven \"biopsychiatrization\" so prevalent in North America. My analysis suggests that psychiatrists' use of this framework ironically contributes to their failed attempts to \"resist\" pharmaceuticalization."}, {"Title": "[Urgent care: psychiatry].", "Abstract": "This text gives advice on how to take a history of present illness, do a mental status examination and come to a correct diagnosis in psychiatric emergencies.

The aim of this paper is to explore the linkages between different components of this pharmaceutical regime through the analysis of psychotropic drug advertising in Canadian medical journals between 1950 and 1990. Advertisements stand at the nexus of macro-level processes related to the development, regulation and marketing of new drug treatments and of micro-level processes related to the use of these drug treatments, both by clinicians and lay persons. We thus examine advertisements from the angle of the mental and classificatory universes to which doctors were exposed through direct-to-prescriber advertisement strategies implemented during this period. Furthermore, we explore to what extent the rationale behind advertisements was permeated by both scientific/professional and popular narratives of mind-body connections. This paper demonstrates that, although this period was marked by paradigm shifts in the classification of mental diseases, the development of modern psychopharmacology, and the questioning of the scientific legitimacy of psychiatry, advertisements unveil a remarkable continuity: that of the mass management of anxiety-depressive disorders by primary care physicians through psychotropic drugs. Also, despite the effective resistance to specificity as shown by the constant redefinitions of diagnostic categories and therapeutic indications, our analysis suggests that the language of specificity used in the promotion of new drugs and in the various narratives of mind-body connection may have been appealing to general practitioners. Finally, our study of the classes of psychoactive medications that have been in use for over half a century reveals a complex, non-linear dynamic of pharmaceuticalisation and de-pharmaceuticalisation."}, {"Title": "The medial forebrain bundle as a deep brain stimulation target for treatment resistant depression: A review of published data.", "Abstract": "Despite a wide variety of therapeutic interventions for major depressive disorder (MDD), treatment resistant depression (TRD) remains to be prevalent and troublesome in clinical practice. In recent years, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an alternative for individuals suffering from TRD not responding to combining antidepressants, multiple adjunctive strategies and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Although the best site for TRD-DBS is still unclear, pilot data suggests that the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) might be a key target to accomplish therapeutic efficacy in TRD patients.\nTo explore the anatomic, electrophysiologic, neurocognitive and treatment data supporting the MFB as a target for TRD-DBS.\nThe MFB connects multiple targets involved in motivated behavior, mood regulation and antidepressant response. Specific phenomenology associated with TRD can be linked specifically to the superolateral branch (sl) of the MFB (slMFB). TRD patients who received DBS-slMFB reported high response/remission rates with an improvement in functioning and no significant adverse outcomes in their physical health or neurocognitive performance.\nThe slMFB is an essential component of a network of structural and functional pathways connecting different areas possibly involved in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. Therefore, the slMFB should be considered as an exciting therapeutic target for DBS therapy to achieve a sustained relief in TRD patients.\nThere is an urgent need for clinical trials exploring DBS-slMFB in TRD. Further efforts should pursue measuring baseline pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and cognition as possible biomarkers of DBS-slMFB response in order to aid clinicians in better patient selection."}, {"Title": "[Parvovirus B19 seroprevalence in a group of schizophrenic patients].", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a highly disabling chronic mental illness.

The hypothesis including viral infections has been the subject of several studies and the role of parvovirus B19 (PB19) in the onset of the disease has been suggested. However, there is, up till now, no seroepidemiological evidence of his involvement.\nTo determine the prevalence of parvovirus B19 (PB19) in schizophrenic patients and in control subjects and to examine clinical associations between viral prevalence, risk factors of infectious disease and clinical features.\nWe carried out a case-control seroepidemiological study in the Psychiatry department of Farhat-Hached general hospital of Sousse (Tunisia). We recruited108 schizophrenic patients and 108 healthy controls free from any psychotic disorder and matched for age and sex. We collected sociodemographic data, medical history, axis I comorbid disorders and infectious risk factors. We assessed patients for psychopathology and severity of illness using respectively the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI). For each study participant, blood sample was collected and levels of IgG and IgM anti-PB19 were measured using the ELISA technique.\nThe prevalence of IgG antibodies to PB19 was significantly higher in schizophrenic patients than in controls (73.1% vs 60.2%; P=0.04). There were no statistical differences between the two groups regarding the prevalence of IgM antibodies to PB19. No association was found between viral prevalence and sociodemographic data, risk factors for infection or clinical characteristics.

In this study, we explored nurses' experiences of restraint and seclusion in short-stay acute old age psychiatry inpatient units and how these experiences underpin resistance to eliminating these practices. Qualitative interviews were conducted with nurses in three old age psychiatry units in Melbourne, Australia. The results provide one overarching theme, lack of accessible alternatives to restraint and seclusion, indicating that nurses believe there are no effective, accessible alternatives to these practices. Three related themes contribute to this perception. First, an adverse interpersonal environment contributes to restraint and seclusion, which relates to undesirable consequences of poor staff-to-patient relationships. Second, an unfavourable physical environment contributes to aggression and restraint and seclusion use. Third, the practice environment influences the adoption of restraint and seclusion. The findings contribute to the limited evidence about nurses' experiences of these practices in short-stay old age psychiatry, and how account needs to be taken of these experiences and contextual influences when introducing measures to address these practices.

In addition, stakeholders offered suggestions that add specificity to existing recommendations, including: (1) In addition to conveying prognostic estimates, clinicians should help families \"see the prognosis for themselves\" by showing families radiographic images and explaining the clinical significance of physical manifestations of severe disease at the bedside. (2) Many physicians did not support using numeric estimates to convey prognosis to families, whereas many surrogates, clinicians from other disciplines, and experts believed numbers could be helpful. (3) Clinicians should conceptualize prognostic communication as an iterative process that begins with a preliminary mention of the possibility of death early in the ICU stay and becomes more detailed as the clinical situation develops. (4) Although prognostic information should be initially disclosed by physicians, other members of the multidisciplinary team-nurses, social workers, and spiritual care providers-should be given explicit role responsibilities to reinforce physicians' prognostications and help families process a poor prognosis emotionally.\nFamily members, clinicians, and experts identified specific communication behaviors that clinicians should use to discuss prognosis in the critical care setting.

An update for psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "We aimed to review research on smoking and mental illness and provide evidence-based guidelines for psychiatrists to help smoking patients quit.\nWe undertook a narrative review of the literature with a special focus on the Australian context.\nAlthough one in three people with mental illness smoke tobacco, smoking is often neglected in psychiatric practice. Smoking is a significant contributor to the health gap between people with mental illness and the general population. Smokers with mental illness are motivated to quit and are able to do so, albeit with lower quit rates. Quitting can lead to substantial improvements in mental wellbeing and physical health and does not exacerbate pre-existing mental illness. Psychiatrists should advise all smokers to quit and provide counselling, medication and support, based on the 5As framework. Approved pharmacotherapy - nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline and bupropion - is recommended for nicotine-dependent smokers. Smoking induces the metabolism of certain psychotropic drugs such as clozapine and olanzapine and dose reductions may be necessary after cessation.\nPsychiatrists have a duty of care to identify the smoking status of their patients and to provide evidence-based support to quit."}, {"Title": "All the world's a stage: evaluating psychiatry role-play based learning for medical students.", "Abstract": "This paper describes an evaluation of an innovative approach, role-play based learning (RBL), as a vehicle for teaching psychiatry. The aim of this intervention, where medical students perform both doctor and patients roles, was to provide an interactive learning format that engaged students while developing clinical knowledge and communication skills in a structured, reflective environment.\nQuestionnaires were completed by 107 students from three clinical schools of the University of Melbourne. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics and thematic content analysis.\nStudent evaluations of the RBL sessions were overwhelmingly positive. Respondents reported improvements in engagement, confidence and empathy, as well as in their learning, and that the sessions provided good preparation for internship as well as for exams.\nThe RBL tutorial programme is unique and flexible and could readily be adapted for use in other specialty rotations.

Patients with symptoms who did not meet clear \"medical\" criteria and were associated with psychological distress and high health care utilization were enrolled in the study by two experienced otorhinolaryngologists following informed consent. The aim of the study is 1) to specify the presence of medically unexplained otorhinolaryngological symptoms and 2) to evaluate the integration of otorhinolaryngological and psychiatric treatment in an interdisciplinary approach in order to help otorhinolaryngologists improve patient care.\nOf the 102 patients included, 41% (N = 42) did not have a proven somatic otorhinolaryngological diagnosis.

Current literature on curricula highlights the importance of maintaining a clinical focus and the balance between didactic content and process issues. The authors present findings from a program evaluation study of a course on religion, spirituality, and psychiatry that deliberately takes a primarily process-oriented, clinically focused approach.\nTwo six-session courses were offered. The first course targeted fourth-year psychiatry residents and the second targeted third-year psychiatry residents. Teaching sessions consisted of brief didactics combined with extensive process-oriented discussion. A two-person faculty team facilitated the courses. Clinical case discussions were integrated throughout the curriculum. A panel of chaplains was invited to participate in one session of each course to discuss the interface between spiritual counsel and psychiatry. A modified version of the Course Impact Questionnaire, a 20-item Likert scale utilized in previous studies of spirituality curricula in psychiatry, assessed residents' personal spiritual attitudes, competency, change in professional practice, and change in professional attitudes before and after the course (N = 20). Qualitative feedback was also elicited through written comments.\nThe results from this study showed a statistically significant difference between the pre- and post-test scale for residents' self-perceived competency and change in professional practice.\nThe findings suggest improvement in competency and professional practice scores in residents who participated in this course. This points toward the overall usefulness of the course and suggests that a process-oriented approach may be effective for discussing religion and spirituality in psychiatric training."}, {"Title": "Lessons learned from the reimbursement profile of a mature private medical toxicology practice: office-based practice pays.", "Abstract": "We previously reported the financial data for the first 5 years of one of the author's medical toxicology practice. The practice has matured; changes have been made. The practice is increasing its focus on office-based encounters and reducing hospital-based acute care encounters. We report the reimbursement rates and other financial metrics of the current practice. Financial records from October 2009 through September 2013 were reviewed. This is a period of 4 fiscal years and represents the currently available financial data. Charges, payments, and reimbursement rates were recorded according to the type and setting of the medical toxicology encounter: forensic consultations, outpatient clinic encounters, nonpsychiatric inpatient consultations, emergency department (ED) consultations, and inpatient psychiatric consultations. All patients were seen regardless of ability to pay or insurance status. The number of billed Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for office-based encounters increased over the study period; the number of billed CPT codes for inpatient and ED consultations reduced. Office-based encounters demonstrate a higher reimbursement rate and higher payments. In the fiscal year (FY) of 2012, office-based revenue exceeded hospital-based acute care revenue by over $140,000 despite a higher number of billed CPT encounters in acute care settings, and outpatient payments were 2.39 times higher than inpatient, inpatient psychiatry, observation unit, and ED payments combined. The average payment per CPT code was higher for outpatient clinic encounters than inpatient encounters for each fiscal year studied. There was an overall reduction in CPT billing volume between FY 2010 and FY 2013. Despite this, there was an increase in total practice revenue. There was no change in payor mix, practice logistics, or billing/collection service company. In this medical toxicology practice, office-based encounters demonstrate higher reimbursement rates and overall payments compared to inpatient and ED consultations. While consistent with our previous studies, these differences have been accentuated. This study demonstrates the results of changes to the practice--reduced inpatient/ED consultations and increased outpatient encounters. These practice changes resulted in higher overall revenue despite a lower patient volume. In this analysis, the office-based practice of medical toxicology has higher reimbursement rates, nearly 2.5 times higher, when compared to hospital-based acute care consultations."}, {"Title": "Efficacy and safety of valproic acid versus haloperidol in patients with acute agitation: results of a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of valproate versus haloperidol in decreasing the agitation level in affected patients in the emergency department. We assigned 80 acutely agitated patients to receive either intravenous sodium valproate (20 mg/kg) or intramuscular haloperidol (5 mg/1 ml). Agitation was measured at baseline and 30 min after the first injection using the Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component subscale, and the Agitated Behavior Scale. For 80 patients treated with sodium valproate, the mean \u00b1 SD dosage was 1541.5 \u00b1 286 mg (range 940-2400). The mean postintervention ACES scores from baseline to 30 min after drug injection were 4.73 (SD = 1.93) for the valproate group and 5.45 (SD = 2.09) for the haloperidol group (P = 0.028). No significant differences were observed in terms of the mean changes 30 min after the intervention for two additional agitation scales. A larger proportion of patients in the haloperidol group experienced intense sedation (36.2%, P < 0.001) and extrapyramidal symptoms (8.7%, P = 0.007) compared with the valproate group (2.5% for intense sedation, no patient for extrapyramidal symptoms).

We examine this in outpatient forensic psychiatry with the Short-Term Assessment of Risk and Treatability (START) at 3 and 6 months follow-up. An incident occurred during 33 (13%) out of 252 3-month and 44 (21%) out of 211 6-month follow-up periods (n = 188 unique clients). Pearson correlations for all predictor variables were in the expected directions. Prediction of recidivism based on historical factor ratings (odds ratio [OR] = 1.10) could not be improved through the addition of dynamic risk, protective strength, or key or critical factor scores (all ORs ns). The addition of the SPJ improved the model to modest accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] = .64) but made no independent significant contribution (OR = 1.55, p = .21) for the 3-month follow-up. For the 6-month follow-up, SPJ scores also increased predictive accuracy to modest (AUC = .67) and made a significant independent contribution to the prediction of the outcome (OR = 1.98, p = .04). Multicollinearity limits were unviolated. Limitations apply, however, results are similar to those from clinical, researcher rated samples and are discussed in the light of setting specific characteristics.

Using the OCF in conjunction with standard diagnostic procedures led to major revisions of diagnoses for 56.5% of patients. Anxiety disorders, especially PTSD, constitute the disorder group in which the most changes were made. In order to understand how information from the OCF interview led clinicians to revise diagnoses, data from clinical discussions were analysed through qualitative content analysis. This revealed four major themes related to the reevaluation, and at times confirmation, of given clinical psychiatric diagnoses: new information; expression of distress in emotional language; expression of distress in relation to life experiences; and improved understanding of the patient's suffering. The findings suggest that the OCF may be useful for: (a) formulating culture in relation to illness experiences, (b) contextualising diagnostic categorisation, and (c) improving overall understanding of the patient that may facilitate individualised planning of treatment and therapy."}, {"Title": "Factors Associated with Missed Psychiatry Visits in an Urban HIV Clinic.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric co-management is often required in HIV primary care.

Descriptive statistics depict patient characteristics, and logistic regression models were fit to evaluate factors associated with failure to establish care at the co-located psychiatry clinic following referral from HIV provider. Of 370 referred, 23 % did not attend a scheduled psychiatry appointment within 6 months of initial referral.

At the same time, the use of first generation antipsychotics continues, although it is declining in France as in other countries. In France, we lack data on the pediatric population to ensure a safe prescription, unlike other countries such as Canada and the United States. This is disturbing when many adverse events, potentially serious for young patients' health (neuromuscular complications, risk factors, cardiovascular problems) are beginning to be identified. This article reports the current French and international knowledge on antipsychotics in the pediatric population. It appears that data in the French population are nearly nonexistent and that the methodological tools used are not always relevant (population already exposed to psychotropic drugs, short studies, debatable rating scale and somatic parameters). Within this context, a safety monitoring procedure for the naive pediatric population treated with antipsychotics was developed (ETAPE study) to determine the incidence of adverse events appearing with these drugs. Safety monitoring during the 12-month study period will include clinical assessments and laboratory testing. These assessments will be performed before treatment and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the introduction of the antipsychotic drug. This study received funding from the National Security Agency of Medicines (ANSM 2012 No.\u00a040). The results should contribute to educating all practitioners (general physicians, pediatricians, psychiatrists, child psychiatrists) on adverse events, helping practitioners with prescribing decisions, reinforcing the French system of monitoring adverse events caused by atypical antipsychotic drugs, and developing recommendations to improve the safety of atypical antipsychotic drugs in child psychiatry."}, {"Title": "\"What is strange is that we don't have more children coming to us\": A habitography of child psychiatrists and scholastic pressure in Kolkata, India.", "Abstract": "The mental health of Indian school children could be expected to be a major topic of research.

This truth was discovered more than a century ago by Aloysius Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist and neuropathologist. As a psychiatrist, he described the behavioral manifestations of \"senile dementia\" in a 51-year-old female; as a neuropathologist, he was the first to recognize the significance of the senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles found in her brain after her death at age 55 years. It was Alzheimer who made the connection between these \"biomarkers\" and the symptoms of the increasingly prevalent disease that now bears his name. In recent years, the search for psychiatry-relevant biomarkers of major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disease, and other important psychiatric/neuropsychiatric disorders has intensified. Biomarkers in psychiatry and neuropsychiatry have the potential of clarifying the etiology of an ambiguous clinical presentation-making it possible, for example, to detect underlying differences between psychological maladies that have confusingly similar symptoms. In addition, attempts are now being made to classify mental disorders on the basis of biomarkers. Biomarkers may also disclose the presence of a previously unsuspected physical explanation for behavior(s) originally presumed to be \"psychiatric\" in origin. Although clinically usable biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness await validation, candidate genomic biomarkers and protein profiling of candidate biomarkers in psychiatry are rapidly gaining ground as areas of interest, with considerable future potential. This review considers biomarker-related issues germane to psychiatry and neuropsychiatry in the context of new data that can be used to tailor therapies to the individual psychiatric patient."}, {"Title": "The prevalence and clinical manifestations of delirium in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review with inferences.", "Abstract": "In high-income countries with ageing populations, delirium is most prevalent in older adults and in palliative and intensive care settings. The prevalence and aetiology of delirium are likely to differ in low income countries, including sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), due to different population demographics, disease burden and exposure to pathogens. We reviewed published literature relating to the prevalence, clinical features and underlying causes of delirium in SSA and compare this with that published in high-income countries in order to identify knowledge and clinical service gaps, and priorities for further research.\nWe performed a narrative review by comprehensively searching the following databases: Medline, PsychInfo, Embase and PubMed. Studies published between January 1 1975 and December 31 2013 in all languages, including the terms 'delirium', 'acute brain syndrome', 'organic brain syndrome', or 'acute confusion' originating from SSA were included. In addition, reference lists of included articles and online databases of African medical literature were hand-searched. We also included case series and case reports due to paucity of published studies.\nWe identified a total of 46 relevant studies. Delirium was the main focus of only one cross-sectional study, whereas most included delirium in studies on neuropsychiatric conditions. Only two studies reported prevalence in older adults. Most studies reported very low (<2%) delirium prevalence, whereas delirium in psychiatric inpatient and outpatient settings was higher than expected (18.2%-29.9%). Descriptive studies of 'bouffee delirante' from psychiatry settings were often describing delirium. Infection and HIV seropositivity were common associations of delirium throughout these studies. There were no studies of intensive, critical or surgical care settings or of management strategies.\nWe currently know very little about the prevalence, presentation and aetiology of delirium in developing countries. This knowledge gap should be tackled with some urgency, in order to address questions of screening, diagnosis, prevention and management in this setting."}, {"Title": "Behavioral activation in acute inpatient psychiatry: a multiple baseline evaluation.", "Abstract": "The present study employed a multiple baseline study design with repeated measures to explore clinical outcomes, therapy mechanisms, and feasibility of Behavioral Activation for persons admitted to inpatient psychiatry.\nSix adult inpatients with depressive symptoms and different psychiatric disorders were randomized to different lengths of baseline standard inpatient treatment. Subsequently a 5-day, 10-session Behavioral Activation protocol was added. Daily self-report outcome and process measures were administered and supplemented with hourly self-reports and clinician assessments before and after each study phase.\nAfter a relatively stable baseline, at least four participants showed marked gradual improvements both in terms of outcome as well as activation and avoidance as Behavioral Activation was initiated. The temporal relation between process and outcome differed somewhat across metrics. In most instances however, change in activation and avoidance either coincided or preceded decreased depression.\nWe did not include some relatively common disorders, did not control for the effects of increased attention, did not investigate treatment integrity, and did not conduct follow-up after discharge. Raters were not blind and measures were mainly focused on depressive symptoms. All received concurrent medical treatment.\nThis preliminary study further supports the promise of Behavioral Activation as an inpatient treatment for persons with a variety of psychiatric disorders. Results also lends preliminary support for the purported mechanisms of Behavioral Activation."}, {"Title": "Behavioral studies on anxiety and depression in a drug discovery environment: keys to a successful future.", "Abstract": "The review describes a personal journey through 25 years of animal research with a focus on the contribution of rodent models for anxiety and depression to the development of new medicines in a drug discovery environment. Several classic acute models for mood disorders are briefly described as well as chronic stress and disease-induction models. The paper highlights a variety of factors that influence the quality and consistency of behavioral data in a laboratory setting. The importance of meta-analysis techniques for study validation (tolerance interval) and assay sensitivity (Monte Carlo modeling) are demonstrated by examples that use historic data. It is essential for successful discovery of new potential drugs to maintain a high level of control in animal research and to bridge knowledge across in silico modeling, and in vitro and in vivo assays. Today, drug discovery is a highly dynamic environment in search of new types of treatments and new animal models which should be guided by enhanced two-way translation between bench and bed. Although productivity has been disappointing in the search of new and better medicines in psychiatry over the past decades, there has been and will always be an important role for in vivo models in-between preclinical discovery and clinical development. The right balance between good science and proper judgment versus a decent level of innovation, assay development and two-way translation will open the doors to a very bright future."}, {"Title": "Joint hypermobility and the heritable disorders of connective tissue: clinical and empirical evidence of links with psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The heritable disorders of connective tissue (HDCTs) are a group of genetic disorders affecting connective tissue matrix proteins. Fragility, laxity of tissues and joint hypermobility (JH) are commons features of HDCT for which the prognosis may range from benign to life threatening. JH and HDCTs, especially joint hypermobility syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and Marfan syndrome, have been associated with psychiatric symptomatology. We explored the existing knowledge concerning this association in order to provide an overview of mental disorders linked to JH/HDCT, as well as the hypotheses proposed to explain such association.\nA comprehensive search of scientific online databases and references lists was conducted, encompassing publications based on quantitative and qualitative research, including case reports.\nPsychiatric conditions in which there is some evidence of an association with JH/HDCT are anxiety disorders, depression, schizophrenia, neurodevelopmental disorders (autism, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and developmental coordination disorder), eating disorders, personality disorders and substance use/misuse.\nDespite the need of more research, the available data highlight the importance of examining psychiatric symptoms in those affected by JH/HDCT and the importance of providing interventions with a multidisciplinary approach.

As the only known orexigenic hormone secreted in the periphery, it increases hunger and appetite, promoting food intake. Ghrelin has also been shown to be involved in various physiological processes being regulated in the central nervous system such as sleep, mood, memory and reward. Accordingly, it has been implicated in a series of psychiatric disorders, making it subject of increasing investigation, with knowledge rapidly accumulating. This review aims at providing a concise yet comprehensive overview of the role of ghrelin in psychiatric disorders. Ghrelin was consistently shown to exert neuroprotective and memory-enhancing effects and alleviated psychopathology in animal models of dementia. Few human studies show a disruption of the ghrelin system in dementia. It was also shown to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of addictive disorders, promoting drug reward, enhancing drug seeking behavior and increasing craving in both animals and humans. Ghrelin's exact role in depression and anxiety is still being debated, as it was shown to both promote and alleviate depressive and anxiety-behavior in animal studies, with an overweight of evidence suggesting antidepressant effects. Not surprisingly, the ghrelin system is also implicated in eating disorders, however its exact role remains to be elucidated. Its widespread involvement has made the ghrelin system a promising target for future therapies, with encouraging findings in recent literature."}, {"Title": "Psychological online consultation service attracts men: a new approach to close the gap between being ill and being treated.", "Abstract": "Since 1999, the University Hospital Zurich (Zurich, Switzerland) has offered an e-mail-based consultation service for individual health concerns where anonymous questions can be asked to an online doctor. This study aimed at the characterization of the user profile, the content of the question, and the answers given specific in the field of psychiatry.\nIn total, 3,148 questions were asked from 2008 to 2010. Of these, 209 (6.6%) requests were selected by International Classification of Diseases-10 and International Classification of Primary Care codes relevant for psychiatry and included in the retrospective qualitative study. The content analysis of the requests was supported by means of the Mayring inductive category system using a professional text analysis program (MAXQDA).\nOf the users, 45.9% were female, and 46.9% were male. The mean age was 37.4 years. The main topics of the request were somatoform, somatization, and hypochondriac disorders in 18.4%, behavioral syndromes in 17.9%, and mood disorders in 15.4%. The reason stated most frequently for using the service was looking for a second opinion. The doctors responded with detailed information about disease and treatment and in 70.8% recommended consultation of a physician.\nTelemedicine is suggested to empower patients by developing health literacy with professional advice. The gender ratio of the users is almost equal, although the prevalence of psychological diseases in the general population is higher in women than in men.

We therefore studied the level of PI interactions and the underlying beliefs and attitudes in a large sample of European psychiatric trainees.\nOne thousand four hundred and forty-four psychiatric trainees in 20 European countries were assessed cross-sectionally, with a 62-item questionnaire.\nThe total number of PI interactions in the preceding two months varied between countries, with least interactions in The Netherlands (M (Mean)=0.92, SD=1.44, range=0-12) and most in Portugal (M=19.06, SD=17.44, range=0-100).

Yet, theories of conditioned responses in humans, such as placebo and nocebo effects on pain, have a strong emphasis on conscious recognition of contextual cues that trigger the response. Here, we investigated the neural pathways involved in nonconscious activation of conditioned pain responses, using functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy participants. Nonconscious compared with conscious activation of conditioned placebo analgesia was associated with increased activation of the orbitofrontal cortex, a structure with direct connections to affective brain regions and basic reward processing. During nonconscious nocebo, there was increased activation of the thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. In contrast to previous assumptions about conditioning in humans, our results show that conditioned pain responses can be elicited independently of conscious awareness and our results suggest a hierarchical activation of neural pathways for nonconscious and conscious conditioned responses. Demonstrating that the human brain has a nonconscious mechanism for responding to conditioned cues has major implications for the role of associative learning in behavioral medicine and psychiatry. Our results may also open up for novel approaches to translational animal-to-human research since human consciousness and animal cognition is an inherent paradox in all behavioral science."}, {"Title": "Diagnostic stability in pediatric bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "The diagnostic stability of pediatric bipolar disorder has not been investigated previously. The aim was to investigate the diagnostic stability of the ICD-10 diagnosis of pediatric mania/bipolar disorder.\nAll patients below 19 years of age who got a diagnosis of mania/bipolar disorder at least once in a period from 1994 to 2012 at psychiatric inpatient or outpatient contact in Denmark were identified in a nationwide register.\nTotally, 354 children and adolescents got a diagnosis of mania/bipolar disorder at least once; a minority, 144 patients (40.7%) got the diagnosis at the first contact whereas the remaining patients (210; 59.3%) got the diagnosis at later contacts before age 19. For the latter patients, the median time elapsed from first treatment contact with the psychiatric service system to the first diagnosis with a manic episode/bipolar disorder was nearly 1 year and for 25% of those patients it took more than 2\u00bd years before the diagnosis was made. The most prevalent other diagnoses than bipolar disorder at first contact were depressive disorder (21.4%), acute and transient psychotic disorders or other non-organic psychosis (19.2%), reaction to stress or adjustment disorder (14.8%) and behavioral and emotional disorders with onset during childhood or adolescents (10.9%). Prevalence rates of schizophrenia, personality disorders, anxiety disorder or hyperkinetic disorders (ADHD) were low.\nData concern patients who get contact to hospital psychiatry only.\nClinicians should be more observant on manic symptoms in children and adolescents who at first glance present with transient psychosis, reaction to stress/adjustment disorder or with behavioral and emotional disorders with onset during childhood or adolescents (F90-98) and follow these patients more closely over time identifying putable hypomanic and manic symptoms as early as possible."}, {"Title": "An adaptationist perspective on the etiology of depression.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) presents with a variety of symptoms and responds to a wide range of treatment interventions. Diagnostic criteria collapse multiple syndromes with distinct etiologies into the same disorder. MDD is typically understood as a malfunction of neurotransmission or brain circuitry regulating mood, pleasure and reward, or executive function. However, research from an evolutionary perspective suggests that the \"normal\" functioning of adaptations may also generate symptoms meeting diagnostic criteria. Functioning adaptations may be an underappreciated etiological pathway to MDD. Many adaptive functions for depressive symptoms have been suggested: biasing cognition to avoid losses, conserving energy, disengaging from unobtainable goals, signaling submission, soliciting resources, and promoting analytical thinking. We review the potential role of these adaptive functions and how they can lead to specific clusters of depressive symptoms. Understanding MDD from such a perspective reduces the heterogeneity of cases and may help to select the best intervention for each patient. We discuss the implications of different adaptive and maladaptive etiological pathways for the use of antidepressants and various modes of psychotherapy. In particular, instances of MDD caused by functioning adaptations may benefit most from treatments that support the adaptive function, or that target the precipitating causal stressor. We conclude that an evolutionary approach to the study of MDD may be one of the more promising approaches to reduce its heterogeneity and to better match patients and treatment."}, {"Title": "Vitamin D and the brain: key questions for future research.", "Abstract": "Over the last decade a convergent body of evidence has emerged from epidemiology, animal experiments and clinical trials which links low vitamin D status with a range of adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes. This research demonstrates that the timing of exposure to low vitamin D influences the nature of brain phenotypes, as exposures during gestation versus adulthood result in different phenotypes. With respect to early life exposures, there is robust evidence from rodent experiments indicating that transient developmental vitamin D (DVD) deficiency is associated with changes in brain structure, neurochemistry, gene and protein expression and behavior. In particular, DVD deficiency is associated with alterations in the dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems. In contrast, recently published animal experiments indicate that adult vitamin D (AVD) deficiency is associated with more subtle neurochemical and behavioral phenotypes. This paper explores key issues that need to be addressed in future research. There is a need to define the timing and duration of the 'critical window' during which low vitamin D status is associated with differential and adverse brain outcomes. We discuss the role for 'two-hit hypotheses', which propose that adult vitamin D deficiency leaves the brain more vulnerable to secondary adverse exposures, and thus may exacerbate disease progression. Finally, we explore the evidence implicating a role for vitamin D in rapid, non-genomic mechanisms that may involve L-type calcium channels and brain function.

However, the lack of stable and reliable outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of CBT for patients with psychosis hinders further development of psychological intervention in patients with psychosis in the Chinese context. The present study therefore aims to translate selected outcomes measures developed in American and European countries to measure the effectiveness of CBT for psychosis into Chinese and evaluate their psychometric properties.\nThirty-three patients with residual psychotic symptoms were recruited in the Department of Psychiatry, Kowloon Hospital, Hong Kong. Participants were asked to complete a set of self-reported questionnaires twice with an interval of a week, including Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire-Revised (BAVQ-R), Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) and Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire (SMQ).\nThe results found that the Chinese versions of BAVQ-R, BCIS and SMQ had excellent test-retest reliability with good to acceptable internal reliability.\nGenerally, all three translated outcome measures were found to be stable and reliable, and were ready for evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive therapy for psychosis in the Chinese population.

This article discusses the genetics of complex traits in psychiatry. The complexity is accounted for by numerous factors, including multiple risk alleles, epistasis, and epigenetic effects such as methylation. Risk alleles can individually be common or rare, and can include, for example, single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variants that are transmitted or are new mutations, and other kinds of variation. Many different kinds of variation can be important for trait risk, either together in various proportions or as different factors in different subjects. Until more recently, approaches to complex traits were limited, and consequently only a few variants, usually of individually minor effect, were identified. At the present time, a much richer armamentarium exists that includes the routine application of genome-wide association studies and next-generation high-throughput sequencing and the combination of this information with other biologically relevant information, such as expression data. We have also seen the emergence of large meta-analysis and mega-analysis consortia. These developments are extremely important for psychiatric genetics, have advanced the field substantially, and promise formidable gains in the years to come as they are applied more widely."}, {"Title": "Differential typology of delusions in major depression and schizophrenia. A critique to the unitary concept of 'psychosis'.", "Abstract": "It is a current trend in psychiatry to discard the Kraepelinian dichotomy schizophrenia vs. manic-depressive illness and use the overinclusive label 'psychosis' to broadly indicate the whole spectrum of severe mental disorders. In this paper we show that the characteristics of psychotic symptoms vary across different diagnostic categories. We compare delusions in schizophrenia and major depression and demonstrate how these phenomena radically differ under these two psychopathological conditions. The identification of specific types of delusions is principally achieved through the differential description of subjective experiences. We will use two general domains to differentiate schizophrenic and depressive delusions, namely the intrinsic and extrinsic features of these phenomena. Intrinsic features are the form and content of delusions, extrinsic ones include the background from which delusions arise, that is, changes in the field of experience, background feelings, ontological framework of experience, and existential orientation. This kind of systematic exploration of the patients' experience may provide a useful integration to the standard symptom-based approach and can be used to establish a differential typology of the clinical manifestation of psychosis based on the fundamental alterations of the structures of subjectivity characterizing each mental disorder, particularly with respect to the Kraepelinian dichotomy schizophrenic vs. manic-depressive illness."}, {"Title": "What Makes Residents Interested in Geriatric Psychiatry?

In the United States, a number of neuroscientific researches are designed specifically to explore legally relevant topics and a case-law has already been developed. In Europe, neuroscientific evidence is increasingly being used in criminal courtrooms, as part of psychiatric testimony, nourishing the debate about the legal implications of brain research in psychiatric-legal settings. Though largely debated, up to now the use of neuroscience in legal contexts had not specifically been regulated by any legislation. In 2011, with the new bioethics law, France has become the first country to admit by law the use of brain imaging in judicial expertise. According to the new law, brain imaging techniques can be used only for medical purposes, or scientific research, or in the context of judicial expertise. This study aims to give an overview of the current state of the neurolaw in the US and Europe, and to investigate the ethical issues raised by this new law and its potential impact on the rights and civil liberties of the offenders.\nAn overview of the emergence and development of \"neurolaw\" in the United States and Europe is given. Then, the new French law is examined in the light of the relevant debates in the French parliament. Consequently, we outline the current tendencies in Neurolaw literature to focus on assessments of responsibility, rather than dangerousness. This tendency is analysed notably in relation to the legal context relevant to criminal policies in France, where recent changes in the legislation and practice of forensic psychiatry show that dangerousness assessments have become paramount in the process of judicial decision. Finally, the potential interpretations of neuroscientific data introduced into psychiatric testimonies by judges are explored.\nThe examination of parliamentary debates showed that the new French law allowing neuroimaging techniques in judicial expertise was introduced in the aim to provide a legal framework that would protect the subject against potential misuses of neuroscience. The underlying fear above all, was that this technology be used as a lie detector, or as a means to predict the subject's behaviour. However, the possibility of such misuse remains open. Contrary to the legislator's wish, the defendant is not fully guaranteed against uses of neuroimaging techniques in criminal courts that would go against their interests and rights. In fact, the examination of the recently adopted legislation in France shows that assessments of dangerousness and of risk of recidivism have become central elements of the criminal policy, which makes it possible, if not likely that neuroimaging techniques be used for the evaluation of the dangerousness of the defendant. This could entail risks for the latter, as judges could perceive neuroscientific data as hard evidence, more scientific and reliable than the soft data of traditional psychiatry. If such neuroscientific data are interpreted as signs of potential dangerousness of a subject rather than as signs of criminal responsibility, defendants may become subjected to longer penalties or measures aiming to ensure public safety in the detriment of their freedom.\nIn the current context of accentuated societal need for security, the judge and the expert-psychiatrist are increasingly asked to evaluate the dangerousness of a subject, regardless of their responsibility. Influenced by this policy model, the judge might tend to use neuroscientific data introduced by an expert as signs of dangerousness. Such uses, especially when they subjugate an individual's interest to those of society, might entail serious threats to an individual's freedom and civil liberties."}, {"Title": "[Pseudodementia, what are we talking about? Part II: From Stertz to Alzheimer: A psychogenic disease after trauma].", "Abstract": "The aim of this work is to give a new anchorage for the initial concept of pseudodementia, its basic definitions and actual clinical implications. The original definition and framework of the concept are misidentified and therefore need to be reintroduced and analysed here. This approach, beyond its heuristic and epistemological goal, has a practical aim: to adjust the psychopathological point of view on pseudodementia.\nIn addition to a conventional survey based on search engines (Medline, PsychINFO and google book), we conducted a systematic review of the concomitant papers related to the rise of the concept.\nThree moments of conceptualization are identified and linked to Wernicke's successors at the university of Breslau. Firstly, Stertz (1910) has described pseudodementia as a psychogenic illness that could occur after any trauma. According to our research, it is probably the first written use of the term pseudodementia in its psychogenic meaning. Secondly, we present Bonhoeffer's approach based on psychogenic reactions (1911). Finally, the views of Alzheimer and his student Schuppius are described: their understanding of pseudodementia is open to psychoanalytic concepts (1914).\nThe concept of pseudodementia (Pseudodemenz) takes shape in a particular period of German history: the promulgation of laws settling railway (1871) and industrial accidents (1884) but also the law of compensation of the traumatic neurosis (1889), the nosological specificity of which was debated. German psychiatry of the beginning of the 20th century was strongly imbued with a moralizing sense of national duty. The disqualification of traumatic neurosis has been followed by a unanimous recognition of traumatic hysteria and its psychogenic hypothesis. As a consequence, traumatic events were rarely taken into consideration and the issue was moved into the private sphere (Privatsache) by questioning patients' morbid wishes. Breslau's psychiatrists analyzed the cognitive disorders of pseudodementia with regard to an ideogenic model of the trauma, which emphasized the subjectivity but which was still facing the primacy of the consciousness. It is in this context, and by reducing the question of the pseudodementia to the situations of detention (Gansersche Syndrom) and pension neuroses (Rentenneurosen), that Bonhoeffer promoted the notion of \"wishing to be sick\" (Wille zur Krankheit). This conception gave a social component to mental disorders but placed in the foreground a suggestive phenomenon, which Raecke included as secondary to the primary symptom of hysterical inhibition. Thus, Schuppius's article under the tutoring of Alo\u00efs Alzheimer offers a double testimony. On one hand, it shows how neuropsychiatry was, by then, at least partially open to the notion of an unconscious causality. On the other hand, it exposes a hidden aspect of Alo\u00efs Alzheimer: a brilliant histopathologist capable of interest for psychodynamic mechanisms.\nIn his famous study of 1961, Leslie Gordon Kiloh argues that the concept of pseudodementia does not belong to any nosological system, is purely descriptive and does not imply an accurate diagnosis. The present work shows a very different conclusion. Initially, the term was introduced in German psychiatry to describe cases of hysterical psychogenic illness after trauma (psychogene Erkrankungen nach Trauma) in which the mechanism of inhibition was discussed. Topologically, we can even define its emergence in the Breslau's university and psychiatric clinic in which Wernicke, Stertz, Bonhoeffer and Alzheimer himself, promoted it. One should also note that the category of hysteria referred to an array of functional mental disorders, including \"hysterical psychosis\" (hysterische Psychosen)."}, {"Title": "[The 5 mental dimensions identified in early maladaptive schemas statistical analysis of Young's schema questionnaire (YSQ-s3)].", "Abstract": "Schemas represent a stable vision of oneself. Young's schema questionnaire-s3 (YSQ-s3) presents 90 perceptions of oneself, specifying 18 early maladaptive schemas (EMS). We studied the intensity and inter-relations of these 18 EMS and how they pool together into a specific domain.\nTwo hundred and ninety four subjects (294 patients from a French private practice in psychiatry and 12 volunteers) filled in a French version of the YSQ-s3. Item scores range from 1 to 6. Only the scores of 4 \"true for me during most of my life\" or higher were kept for the statistical analysis. Data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics, principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA).\nThe EMS mean scores ranged from 3.4 to 12.9 and standard deviations from 5.9 to 9.7. EMS score correlations range from 0.009 to 0.55. The principal component analysis (PCA), that provides linear combinations of each EMS score, yields only one meaningful component. Indeed, the screen plot that provides the eigen values associated with each principal component, suggests keeping only the first component. This component presents a size-effect and represents the \"global scores intensity\". The hierarchical clustering analysis (HC) fits the 18 EMS in 5 domains (r(2) = 0.4): (1) \"avoidance\" (with 3 EMS: emotional deprivation, social isolation/alienation, emotional inhibition), (2)\"give\" (with 1 EMS: self-sacrifice), (3) \"take\" (with 3 EMS: entitlement/grandiosity, insufficient self-control/self-discipline, approval-seeking/recognition-seeking) (4) \"awareness\" (with 8 EMS: abandonment/instability, mistrust/abuse, defectiveness/shame, dependence/incompetence, vulnerability to harm or illness, enmeshment/undeveloped self, failure, subjugation) (5) \"faith\" (with 3 EMS: negativity/pessimism, unrelenting standards/hyper-criticalness, punitiveness). When the HC analysis is applied to the population (n = 294), it yields 6 classes of patients. The mean score of the 5 domains, described above, can describe these classes.\nThese 5 domains do not completely fit Young's five \"primary infantile needs\" domains. Only 2/3 of the EMS are correctly attributed to the \"primary infantile needs\" domains. The 5 domains seem closely related to the 5 dimensions of the NEO-PI-R or to the 5 domains of personality disorders (criteria b) described in the DSM-5. In our understanding the dimensions \"avoidance, give, take\" represent 3 types of relationship to others (on behavioral level). The dimension \"awareness\" represents the fears and losses (on the emotional level) and \"faith\" represents beliefs and consciousness (on the cognitive level). The intensity of the 5 domains inside each class of patients could guide the clinical interpretation, specifically for personality disorders."}, {"Title": "Assessment of competence in surgical skills using functional magnetic resonance imaging: a feasibility study.", "Abstract": "Patient safety is fundamental to modern medical practice; safe surgery saves lives. Ensuring surgical competence is becoming more difficult at a time when surgeons are being trained in fewer hours. Accurate objective assessment of technical skills ability is lacking in standardization. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has a long history in neuroscience, psychiatry, and cognitive studies. Many studies have explored levels of perceived expertise in sports and musical ability. Little has been published on actual rather than perceived motor skills. This study sought to assess the feasibility of utilizing a novel assessment method by measuring blood oxygen level-dependent signal changes (BOLD) in specific brain regions via fMRI during a surgical skills task.\nImages were acquired using fMRI in a pilot study of 9 subjects (3 experts, 3 intermediates, and 3 novices) when performing and imagining performing a basic surgical procedure: hand tying of surgical knots. Level of expertise was based on years of experience and clinical grade. The quality and quantity of knots were assessed objectively by 2 experts who were independent of the study and blinded to the ability of the candidate. The effect of subject head motion caused by the task itself was assessed. The efficacy of fMRI data analyses in removing artifacts caused by this noise source in the data was explored.\nShifts of less than 1 voxel (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3.55 mm(3)) were recorded in all participants and were successfully corrected in all cases in the fMRI preprocessing step. Decreased BOLD activity was observed in experts compared to novices when \"knot tying\" was compared with the control \"finger tap.\" Increased BOLD activity was observed in experts compared with novices when \"imagining a task\" in the primary visual cortex, an area important in perceptual learning. Experts and intermediates performed consistently with 100% square knots. Novices had an average of 2 slip knots. Regarding knot quantity, the number of knots ranged from 14 to 26 in novices, 38 to 47 in intermediates, and 54 to 58 in experts. A Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test revealed that the difference between the 3 groups was statistically significant in the quantity of square knots tied (p = 0.147). Specific regions of interest identified concurred with findings of previous studies and included the left supramarginal, left rolandic operculum, and left postcentral regions.\nWe found that fMRI is a feasible method of exploring actual and perceived motor skill abilities.

Armodafinil, a wakefulness-promoting agent, has been studied as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. Armodafinil and the mood stabilizer carbamazepine are both inducers of and substrates for cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4). This study was designed to evaluate the bidirectional carbamazepine-armodafinil pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction.\nThis was an open-label, single-center study conducted in healthy adult men. Subjects assigned to group 1 received a dose of carbamazepine (200 mg) alone and a dose after pretreatment with daily dosing of armodafinil (titrated to 250 mg/d). Subjects assigned to group 2 received a dose of armodafinil (250 mg) alone and a dose after pretreatment with carbamazepine BID (titrated to 400 mg/d). Pharmacokinetic parameters for carbamazepine, armodafinil, and their major circulating metabolites were determined when dosed alone and after pretreatment with the other drug. The safety and tolerability of armodafinil and carbamazepine were also assessed throughout the study.\nEighty-one subjects enrolled in the study (group 1 = 40; group 2 = 41), of whom 79 (group 1 = 40; group 2 = 39) were evaluable for pharmacokinetic analysis and 80 (group 1 = 40; group 2 = 40) were evaluable for safety analysis. In group 1, pretreatment with armodafinil reduced systemic exposure to carbamazepine by 12% for Cmax and 25% for AUC (based on comparison of geometric means). Similarly, in group 2, pretreatment with carbamazepine reduced systemic exposure to armodafinil by 11% for Cmax and 37% for AUC. Systemic exposure to the metabolites of these agents that are formed via CYP3A4 were increased after pretreatment in each group. There were no new or unexpected adverse events.\nSystemic exposure to both carbamazepine and armodafinil was reduced after pretreatment with the other drug; systemic exposure to the metabolites of each drug, which are formed via CYP3A4, was increased. These changes were consistent with the induction of CYP3A4. Both drugs were generally safe and well tolerated alone and in combination under the conditions studied. Dose adjustment may be required when initiating or discontinuing armodafinil and carbamazepine cotherapy."}, {"Title": "On-going elucidation of mechanisms of primate specific synaptic spine development using the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).", "Abstract": "Recently, pathophysiology of human psychiatry originates from abnormal numbers of synapses/spines. There are generally two-types of development of spines from birth depending on species. One is, after birth, synaptogenesis occurs, and there is a clear peak of spines, and then rapidly pruning occurring, which are called \"overshoot-type\" of development of synapses/spines. Primates including human belong to this type. In other type including rodents, even after a peak, general number of spines does not decrease so much. Although these differences, most of human psychiatric models have been genetic modified rodents. Now, transgenic primate (the common marmoset) became available. In near future, we can, examine pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders using this animal model, which is closer to human being. To begin with this endeavor, we should know how synapses/spines of normal marmosets developed, and molecular mechanisms of \"overshoot-type\" of spine development, which human being also shows.

Starting in 1949 a journal with the title \"Psychiatry, Neurology and Medical Psychology\" was founded as no publishing house existed in the field of psychiatry and neurology and it became necessary to establish a new journal that was competitive. The journal was primarily distributed in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) until 1990 but the interest internationally was very limited. State affairs had a great influence from the very beginning so that the political involvement was reflected in the selection of staff, such as the publishers and the head of the editorial department and by the close interconnection between the Society for Psychiatry and Neurology of the GDR and the editorship of the journal.

With recent evidence that the vast majority of mental disorders, even when they emerge in adulthood, cause abnormal neurodevelopment and resultant emphasis on prevention and early intervention, there is a need to put child psychiatry at the top of the agenda in mental health research. This should also be the case for developmental neuropsychopharmacology. The target of drug discovery should shift toward a population younger than the one that is typically included in clinical trials. This is not only a matter of trying to replicate what has been found in individuals with mature brains; it is about searching for new strategies that address developing brains while the therapeutic window for their effect is still open. At present, major concerns in developmental psychopharmacology are over-prescription rates and use of psychotropic medications for conditions with a particularly underdeveloped evidence base, as well as adverse effects, especially potentially life-shortening cardiometabolic effects and suicidal ideation.

A simulation model was constructed from data derived from two recent publications, selected as examples of studies that investigated multivariate predictors of long-term outcome following FEP.\nWe illustrate how illness trajectories following FEP could be described based on multimodal sociodemographic, clinical, psychological, and neurobiological information. A clinical modeling simulation shows thatrisk trajectories for achieving long-term favorable or unfavorable outcomes can differ significantly depending on baseline characteristics in combination with MRI and functional measurements within 6 months of disease onset.\nMultimodal trajectory modeling may be useful to describe longitudinal outcomes following FEP. Richlongitudinal data on predictors and outcomes, and better integration of multimodal (sociodemographic, clinical, psychological, biological) data, are required to operationalize this approach.

The impact of age, sex, and genotype on specific outcomes in neurology, orthopedics, internal medicine, and psychiatry were investigated. The mean age of individuals with AS was 24 years (range 16-50y). Active seizures were present in 41% of individuals, and 72% had sleep dysfunction.

The literature database used contains approximately 2,500 papers on various aspects of the genuine PR. These \u2018meta-analyses\u2019 were screened for statistical predictors of the PR across multiple RCT, including age and gender, but also other patient-based and design-based predictors of higher PR rates.

Only 15 of the 75 analyses noted an effect of younger age to be associated with higher PR, and this was predominantly in psychiatric conditions but not in depression, and internal medicine but not in gastroenterology. Female gender was associated with higher PR in only 3 analyses. Among the patient-based predictors, the most frequently noted factor was lower symptom severity at baseline, and among the design- based factors, it was a randomization ratio that selected more patients to drugs than to placebo, more frequent study visits, and more recent trials that were associated with higher PR rates. While younger age may contribute to the PR in some conditions, sex does not. There is currently no evidence that the PR is different in the elderly.

Interest in features of our local environments that may promote better mental health and wellbeing continues to rise among decision makers. Our purpose was to highlight a selection of these challenges and some promising avenues for enhancing the quality of evidence. Method. An analysis of approximately 267,\u00a0000 people was used to test the local relative deprivation hypothesis, wherein the shortfall of a person's socioeconomic circumstances from their neighbours is said to impact negatively upon mental health. This case was used to anchor further discussion of challenges to identifying and interpreting genuine 'place effects' from spurious correlations. Results. A Median Odds Ratio of 1.29 computed via multilevel logistic regression showed that the odds of experiencing psychological distress (as measured by the Kessler score) varied by geographical area. Approximately 67% of this was attributed to a cross-classified measure of household income and neighbourhood deprivation. Compared to people on high incomes living in affluent neighbourhoods, the odds ratio of psychological distress for people on low incomes in affluent areas was 4.73 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 4.39, 5.09), whereas that for people on low incomes in deprived areas was significantly higher at 5.83 (95% CI 5.41, 6.28). Conclusions. While no evidence was found to support local relative deprivation hypothesis, the pattern suggests that more affluent areas may contain features that are conducive to better mental health. Selection of bespoke geographical boundaries, use of directed acyclic graphs and more evaluations of natural experiments are likely to be important in taking the field of enquiry onwards."}, {"Title": "Spirituality and Health Education: A National Survey of Academic Leaders UK.", "Abstract": "Whole person care is deemed important within UK medical practice and is therefore fundamental in education.

Largely because of this characteristic, different models are used for different disorders, however, there is still a remnant tendency towards reductionist views in the field. In this paper I argue that the available empirical evidence from psychiatry gives us reasons to question biological reductionism and that, in its place, we should adopt a pluralistic explanatory model that is more suited to the needs of the discipline and to the needs of the patients it is meant to help. This will allow us to retain psychiatry as an autonomous science that can productively co-exist with neuroscience while also giving patients the kind of attention they need. I further argue that this same evidence supports a view of the mind that is anti-reductive and that allows that causation can be both bottom-up and top-down and that such a view is available in emergentism coupled with an interventionist model of causation."}, {"Title": "[Psyche and soma: what can the consultation-liaison psychiatrist contribute?].", "Abstract": "In German speaking countries, during the last decades, we can see a growing, though albeit small, integration of psychiatry and psychosomatics into (somatic) medicine.

This review provides evidence for the gut microbiota as a key factor mediating the link between diet and depressive illness.\nThe development of new technologies is affording a better understanding of how diet influences gut microbiota composition and activity and how this may, in turn, influence depressive illness. New interventions are also suggesting the possible utility of pre and probiotic formulations and fermented food in influencing mental health.\nAlthough in its early stages, the emerging field of research focused on the human microbiome suggests an important role for the gut microbiota in influencing brain development, behaviour and mood in humans.

However, the underlying neural circuitry of these effects has not yet been investigated. Using a cross-over, double-blind, vehicle-controlled design, 22 heroin-dependent and heroin-maintained outpatients from the Centre of Substance Use Disorders at the University Hospital of Psychiatry in Basel were studied after heroin and placebo administration, while 17 healthy controls from the general population were included for placebo administration only. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to detect brain responses to fearful faces and dynamic causal modelling was applied to compute fear-induced modulation of connectivity within the emotional face network. Stress responses were assessed by hormone releases and subjective ratings. Relative to placebo, heroin acutely reduced the fear-induced modulation of connectivity from the left fusiform gyrus to the left amygdala and from the right amygdala to the right orbitofrontal cortex in dependent patients. Both of these amygdala-related connectivity strengths were significantly increased in patients after placebo treatment (acute withdrawal) compared to healthy controls, whose connectivity estimates did not differ from those of patients after heroin injection. Moreover, we found positive correlations between the left fusiform gyrus to amygdala connectivity and different stress responses, as well as between the right amygdala to orbitofrontal cortex connectivity and levels of craving. Our findings indicate that the increased amygdala-related connectivity during fearful face processing after the placebo treatment in heroin-dependent patients transiently normalizes after acute heroin maintenance treatment. Furthermore, this study suggests that the assessment of amygdala-related connectivity during fear processing may provide a prognostic tool to assess stress levels in heroin-dependent patients and to quantify the efficacy of maintenance treatments in drug addiction."}, {"Title": "Suicide medical malpractice: an educational overview.", "Abstract": "A malpractice lawsuit is in the legal category of an action in tort, which is a demand for compensation for the damages that have occurred. For a physician to be found liable to a patient for malpractice, four essential elements must be proved to sustain an assertion of malpractice: duty, negligence, harm, and causation. The incidence of malpractice litigation in the field of psychiatry is increasing. The most common malpractice claim related to psychiatric practice is the failure to provide reasonable protection to patients from killing themselves. A psychiatrist should be able to evaluate suicide risk on the basis of all available information, including patient responses to direct and indirect questions, known risk factors, information on how the patient behaved under similar circumstances in the past, and collateral information. Reasonable care necessitates that a patient who is either thought of being or established to be suicidal must be the subject of some precautions. A failure either to soundly assess a patient's suicide risk or to employ an appropriate safety plan after the suicide potential becomes foreseeable is likely to make a physician liable if the patient is harmed because of a suicide event.

There is a strong biologic basis in CU traits, offering the possibility to design biological interventions to address this risk factor. This paper advances the hypothesis that the administration of exogenous oxytocin is a biological intervention worthy of further investigation to address CU traits and moderate future risk factors for forensic behaviors. The evidence for this assertion rests in the empiric evidence that social cognitive deficits play a major role in child and adolescent CU traits and psychopathy. Simultaneously, emerging evidence suggests that youth with CU traits have defined neuroendocrinological correlates within the oxytocin system. A review of the normal neurohormonal physiology of this system is presented to provide a groundwork for the delineation of these correlates. That deficits in this system are found in alternate psychopathologies that present with deficits in social cognition serves as the basis for the hypothesis that these deficits may play a key role in the development and manifestation of CU traits. Their correction through psychopharmacologic and alternate means may provide a future route to addressing a central area of adolescent forensic psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Forensic psychiatric evaluations: an overview of methods, ethical issues, and criminal and civil assessments.", "Abstract": "Forensic psychiatry is frequently defined as the branch of psychiatry that deals with issues arising in the interface between psychiatry and the law.

The goal of this study is to examine the prevalence and treatment of OSA in psychiatric populations.\nA systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines was conducted to determine the prevalence of OSA in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders, and to examine potential interventions. The PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched (last search April 26, 2014) using keywords based on the ICD-9-CM coding for OSA and the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic groups.\nThe search retrieved 47 records concerning studies of OSA in the selected disorders. The prevalence studies indicate that there may be an increased prevalence of OSA in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), despite considerable heterogeneity and a high risk of bias. There was insufficient evidence to support increased OSA in schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, bipolar and related disorders, and anxiety disorders other than PTSD. Studies of treatment of OSA indicate an improvement in both OSA and psychiatric symptoms. CPAP adherence was reduced in veterans with PTSD.\nOSA prevalence may be increased in MDD and PTSD. In individuals with OSA and psychiatric illness, treatment of both disorders should be considered for optimal treatment outcomes."}, {"Title": "A pilot trial of telephone-based collaborative care management for PTSD among Iraq/Afghanistan war veterans.", "Abstract": "Collaborative care and care management are cornerstones of Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) and have been shown to reduce depressive symptoms. Historically, the standard of Veterans Affairs (VA) collaborative care was referring patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to specialty care. Although referral to evidence-based specialty care is ideal, many veterans with PTSD do not receive such care. To address this issue and reduce barriers to care, VA currently recommends veterans with PTSD be offered treatment within PC-MHI as an alternative. The current project outlines a pilot implementation of an established telephone-based collaborative care model-Translating Initiatives for Depression into Effective Solutions (TIDES)-adapted for Iraq/Afghanistan War veterans with PTSD symptoms (TIDES/PTSD) seen in a postdeployment primary care clinic.\nStructured medical record extraction and qualitative data collection procedures were used to evaluate acceptability, feasibility, and outcomes.\nMost participants (n=17) were male (94.1%) and white (70.6%). Average age was 31.2 (standard deviation=6.4) years. TIDES/PTSD was successfully implemented within PC-MHI and was acceptable to patients and staff. Additionally, the total number of care manager calls was positively correlated with number of psychiatry visits (r=0.63, p<0.05) and amount of reduction in PTSD symptoms (r=0.66, p<0.05). Overall, participants in the pilot reported a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms over the course of the treatment (t=2.87, p=0.01).\nTIDES can be successfully adapted and implemented for use among Iraq/Afghanistan veterans with PTSD. Further work is needed to test the effectiveness and implementation of this model in other sites and among veterans of other eras."}, {"Title": "Differential Gambling Motivations and Recreational Activity Preferences Among Casino Gamblers.", "Abstract": "This study investigated three different types of gamblers (recreational, problem, and pathological gamblers) to determine differences in gambling motivations and recreational activity preferences among casino gamblers. We collected data from 600 gamblers recruited in an actual gambling environment inside a major casino in South Korea. Findings indicate that motivational factors of escape, sightseeing, and winning were significantly different among these three types of gamblers. When looking at motivations to visit the casino, pathological gamblers were more likely to be motivated by winning, whereas recreational gamblers were more likely to be motivated by scenery and culture in the surrounding casino area. Meanwhile, the problem gamblers fell between these two groups, indicating higher preferences for non-gambling activities than the pathological gamblers. As this study builds upon a foundational previous study by Lee et al. (Psychiatry Investig 6(3):141-149, 2009), the results of this new study were compared with those of the previous study to see if new developments within a resort-style casino contribute to changes in motivations and recreational activity preferences."}, {"Title": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in childhood and adolescence is an impairing condition, associated with a specific set of distressing symptoms incorporating repetitive, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and distressing, time-consuming rituals (compulsions).

We surveyed residents from both models regarding their views of the CLPsych psychiatry experience. We also compared the scores on the Psychiatric Resident in Training Examination (PRITE). Lastly, we surveyed physicians who requested and received psychiatric consultations.\nResidents trained in the block CLPsych model reported a better education and clinical care compared longitudinal model.

Sixteen mental health clinicians were recruited. Semi-structured individual interviews were used to explore their perceptions and experiences communicating a schizophrenia diagnosis. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematic analysis undertaken.\nThere were five key themes relating to the process of communication about a diagnosis of schizophrenia: (1) orientation to patient care, (2) planning of communication, (3) the impact of team leadership and inter/intra-professional functioning on communication tasks, (4) the roles of different clinicians in communicating about diagnosis and treatment, and (5) time and resource deficiencies. Despite expressing care and concern for vulnerable patients and embracing the concept of multidisciplinary teams, communicating diagnostic information to patients and families was generally unplanned for, with little consistency regarding leadership approaches, or how the team communicated diagnostic information to the patient and family. This contributed to tensions between different team members.\nThe findings demonstrated a number of issues compromising good communication around a schizophrenia diagnosis, both in terms of clinician skill and clinical context, and support the importance of education and training for all members of the multidisciplinary team about their role in the communication process."}, {"Title": "Sociodemographic characteristics and drug abuse patterns of adolescents admitted for substance use disorder treatment in Istanbul.", "Abstract": "Adolescent substance use is an increasing major health problem in developing countries.\nTo evaluate the sociodemographic characteristics and drug abuse patterns of children and youth seeking treatment in Turkey.\nThis retrospective study reviewed the demographic and clinical data of substance users who visited the substance addiction treatment clinic for children and youth in Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Research and Training Hospital for Psychiatry, Neurology and Neurosurgery in Istanbul, between January 2011 and December 2012.\nThe sample comprised of 1969 children and youth aged between 11 and 20 (346 female and 1623 male). Cannabis (60.1%), followed by solvents/inhalants (38.3%) and ecstasy (33.4%), were the most prevalent substances used. The use of solvents/inhalants was more common among males, whereas ecstasy and cocaine use were more common among females. The mean age for the onset of substance use was 13 years. The proportion of polysubstance use was 60.2%. There was a mean duration of 2.28\u2009\u00b1\u20091.91 years between the first substance use and seeking treatment. The risk factors for most of the drug usage were onset of substance use at a young age, gender, treatment admission at older ages, higher parental criminal history, and having substance using parents or relatives.\nFindings of the very early onset of substance and polysubstance use indicated easy accessibility of legal and illicit substances by children and youth in Istanbul. These findings on Turkish children and youth who seek substance use treatment can be useful in developing preventive early interventions and treatment facilities."}, {"Title": "Medication-administration errors in an urban mental health hospital: a direct observation study.", "Abstract": "In the present study, we aimed to identify the incidence, type, and potential clinical consequence of medication-administration errors made in a mental health hospital, and to investigate factors that might increase the risk of error. A prospective, direct observational technique was used to collect data from nurse medication rounds on each of the hospital's 43 inpatient wards. Regression analysis was used to identify potential error predictors. During the 172 medication rounds observed, 139 errors were detected in 4177 (3.3%) opportunities. The most common error was incorrect dose omission (52/139, 37%). Other common errors included incorrect dose (25/139, 18%), incorrect form (16/139, 12%), and incorrect time (12/139, 9%). Fifteen (11%) of the errors were of serious clinical severity; the rest were of negligible or minor severity. Factors that increased the risk of error included the nurse interrupting the medication round to attend to another activity, an increased number of 'when required' doses of medication administered, a higher number of patients on the ward, and an increased number of doses of medication due. These findings suggest that providers of inpatient mental health-care services should adopt medicine-administration systems that minimize task interruption and the use of 'when required' medication, as well as taking steps to reduce nursing workload."}, {"Title": "Attention-based classification pattern, a research domain criteria framework, in youths with bipolar disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "The National Institute of Mental Health has initiated the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project. Instead of using disorder categories as the basis for grouping individuals, the RDoC suggests finding relevant dimensions that can cut across traditional disorders. Our aim was to use the RDoC's framework to study patterns of attention deficit based on results of Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT II) in youths diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), BD+ADHD and controls.\nEighteen healthy controls, 23 patients with ADHD, 10 with BD and 33 BD+ADHD aged 12-17 years old were assessed. Pattern recognition was used to partition subjects into clusters based simultaneously on their performance in all CPT II variables. A Fisher's linear discriminant analysis was used to build a classi\ufb01er.\nUsing cluster analysis, the entire sample set was best clustered into two new groups, A and B, independently of the original diagnoses. ADHD and BD+ADHD were divided almost 50% in each subgroup, and there was an agglomeration of controls and BD in group B. Group A presented a greater impairment with higher means in all CPT II variables and lower Children's Global Assessment Scale. We found a high cross-validated classi\ufb01cation accuracy for groups A and B: 95.2%. Variability of response time was the strongest CPT II measure in the discriminative pattern between groups A and B.\nOur classificatory exercise supports the concept behind new approaches, such as the RDoC framework, for child and adolescent psychiatry. Our approach was able to define clinical subgroups that could be used in future pathophysiological and treatment studies."}, {"Title": "Viability of a Web-Based Module for Teaching Electrocardiogram Reading Skills to Psychiatry Residents: Learning Outcomes and Trainee Interest.", "Abstract": "Web-based instruction in post-graduate psychiatry training has shown comparable effectiveness to in-person instruction, but few topics have been addressed in this format.

Beside somatic treatment and psychotherapeutic interventions, treatment options for patients with severe mental illness also include psychosocial interventions. This paper summarizes the results of a number of systematic literature searches on psychosocial interventions for people with severe mental illness. Based on this evidence appraisal, recommendations for the treatment of people with severe mental illness were formulated and published in the evidence-based guideline series of the German Society for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Neurology (DGPPN) as an evidence-based consensus guideline (\"S3 guideline\"). Recommendations were strongly based on study results, but used consensus processes to consider external validity and transferability of the recommended practices to the German mental healthcare system. A distinction is made between system-level interventions (multidisciplinary team-based psychiatric community care, case management, vocational rehabilitation and participation in work life and residential care interventions) and single psychosocial interventions (psychoeducation, social skills training, arts therapies, occupational therapy and exercise therapy). There is good evidence for the efficacy of the majority of psychosocial interventions in the target group. The best available evidence exists for multidisciplinary team-based psychiatric community care, family psychoeducation, social skills training and supported employment. The present guideline offers an important opportunity to further improve health services for people with severe mental illness in Germany. Moreover, the guideline highlights areas for further research."}, {"Title": "Auditory verbal hallucinations reflect stable auditory attention deficits: a prospective study.", "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown that auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) in psychosis are associated with reduced verbal auditory attention.

It has been suggested that person-centred care in inpatient psychiatry might differ from person-centred care in other contexts, indicating a need to clarify the concept in this specific context. Scholarly papers from health-related disciplines were identified following a systematic search of the electronic databases CINAHL, PUBMED and PsycINFO, covering records indexed up until March 2014. An evolutionary approach to concept analysis was applied, integrating principles for data extraction and analysis in integrative reviews. The concept of person-centred care was defined as cultural, relational and recovery-oriented. It aspires to improve care and calls for a transformation of inpatient psychiatry. The concept is closely related to the concepts of recovery and interpersonal nursing. The result is described in terms of attributes, antecedents, consequences and related concepts. It is concluded that the further development of the concept needs to consider the contexts of the concept at both conceptual and praxis levels. Further research should explore the nature of and relationships between context, culture, care practice and outcomes in inpatient psychiatry from a perspective of person-centred care.

Following unsuccessful attempts at legal recourse, Kohlhaas takes up arms against the authorities, and in the course of his uncompromising pursuit of justice eventually sacrifices his own and his family's lives. Kleist accurately portrays Kohlhaas' psychopathological development from a psychologically balanced, emotionally warm family man to one who causes utter destruction, mayhem and the loss of innocent lives. This literary work is a remarkably authentic, insightful and rich representation of litigious/querulant behaviour, described by classical authors as litigious paranoia, a diagnostic category currently subsumed under 'delusional disorder, persecutory type', in DSM-5 and 'persistent delusional disorder' in ICD-10.\nKleist's novella offers important clues to better understand the development of litigious-querulant behaviour and the inner world of its sufferers. An analysis of the novella also illustrates the contribution that fiction could make to resuscitate the narrative as a complement to criterion-based diagnostic practice prevailing in contemporary psychiatry. \u00a9 2014 S.

There is a version for adolescents-ASRS-Adolescent (ASRS-A)-and the corresponding screening version (ASRS-A-S), which has not been validated to date.\nThe aim was to validate the ASRS-A and the ASRS-A-S for use in adolescent clinical populations.\nAdolescent psychiatric outpatients (n = 134, mean age 15 years, 40% boys) reported on the ASRS-A, and were interviewed with the Kiddie Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS), a semi-structured interview, together with a parent.\nInternal consistency was 0.79 for the ASRS-A-S and 0.92 for the ASRS-A (Cronbach's alpha). Internal consistency values were 0.79 and 0.87 for the inattention subscale, and 0.68 and 0.89 for the hyperactivity subscale, respectively. Concurrent validity values, measured with Spearman's correlation coefficient, between the total K-SADS ADHD symptom severity score and the sum of ASRS-A-S and ASRS-A total scores were 0.51 and 0.60, respectively.

Participants were women enrolled during pregnancy (N = 69,030). Internal validity was evaluated by way of bootstrapped parameter estimates using the overall sample and a split sample calibration approach.\nBootstrap bias estimates were below the problematic threshold, and extend earlier findings (Knoph Berg et al., Aust N Z J Psychiatry, 42, 396-404, 2008) by providing support for the validity of the models at the population level of all pregnant women in Norway. Bootstrap risk ratios indicated that prevalence, incidence, and remission of BN during pregnancy were significantly associated with psychosocial factors. The split sample procedure showed that the models developed on the training sample did not predict risks in the validation sample.\nThis study characterizes associations between psychosocial exposures and BN outcomes among pregnant women in Norway. Women with lifetime and current self-reported psychosocial adversities were at a much higher risk for BN during pregnancy. Psychosocial factors were associated with BN remission during pregnancy, inviting the prospect of enhancing therapeutic interventions.

Child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) postgraduate training can play a pivotal role in increasing access to youth mental health services. In comparison to Europe and North America, however, little is reported regarding CAP training in the Far East, one of the most dynamic and rapidly developing world regions with a very young population. This paper presents an original study on the current status of academic child and adolescent psychiatry training across the Far East.\nWe collected data from 17 countries in the Far East using an internally distributed questionnaire to the Consortium members invited for this study, consisting of leading academic child and adolescent psychiatrists in each country.\nBased on informants' input, we found an overall underdevelopment of CAP postgraduate training systems despite CAP's recognition as a subspecialty in 12 of 17 of the nations or functionally self-governing areas in the Far East. Paucity of official guidelines for CAP training was also evident. All informants reported a need for additional child and adolescent mental health professionals.\nThere seems to be several obstacles to the development of CAP postgraduate training in the Far East, including stigma towards mental health issues and lack of funding. International collaboration is desired to develop evidence-based and culture-tailored CAP training systems."}, {"Title": "Effects of a Regulatory Protocol for Mechanical Restraint and Coercion in a Spanish Psychiatric Ward.", "Abstract": "There is still limited information on what type of measures are most efficient to reduce coercion.

Very little is known about the similarities and differences between these syndromes. The present study addresses this issue by examining the nature of semantic memory impairment (more precisely, object-based knowledge) in patients at risk of developing AD.\nParticipants were 17 elderly patients with aMCI, 18 patients with aMCI plus depressive symptoms (aMCI/D+), 15 patients with LLD, and 29 healthy controls. All participants were aged 55 years or older and were administered a semantic battery designed to assess semantic knowledge for 16 biological and 16 man-made items.\nOverall performance of aMCI/D+ participants was significantly worse than the 3 other groups, and performance for questions assessing knowledge for biological items was poorer than for questions relating to man-made items.\nThis study is the first to show that aMCI/D+ is associated with object-based semantic memory impairment. These results support the view that semantic deficits in aMCI are associated with concomitant depressive symptoms. However, depressive symptoms alone do not account exclusively for semantic impairment, since patients with LLD showed no semantic memory deficit."}, {"Title": "A double-edged sword: review of the interplay between physical health and mental health.", "Abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that there is interplay between physical and mental health, with causality in both directions. A common theme across countries is the uncertainty surrounding who should act as gatekeeper for physical health matters in psychiatry. Much of the metabolic monitoring is carried out by psychiatrists who often feel ill equipped to treat medical problems such as abnormal cholesterol or disturbances of glucose metabolism. However many patients do not attend primary care on a regular basis and may not be likely to follow through on referral to primary care. This review aims to examine the interplay between co-morbid physical and mental health conditions, identify the physical health conditions particularly associated with severe affective and psychotic illness and briefly discuss interventions and recommendations in this area. As people with severe mental illness die 10-20 years younger than their peers, with much of this premature mortality due to cardiovascular disease, this topic is emerging as one of great importance amongst clinicians and policymakers internationally."}, {"Title": "Neuropsychiatry and neural cubism.", "Abstract": "The art movement known as Cubism did not represent a failure of perspective but, rather, was a movement aimed at advancing art by juxtaposing different perspectives. In this issue, Taylor and colleagues describe the current approach by neurologists and psychiatrists to patients with brain disorders as \"Neural Cubism\" because of the competing angles of these specialists' perspectives about these disorders. They advocate both integrated training for all residents in the two fields and a system of \"nested hierarchies\" to reclassify brain disorders according to their effect on levels of brain function. The unspoken premise of their article is that it is time for psychiatry and neurology to reunite.This Commentary takes the view that reuniting the long-separated specialties of neurology and psychiatry would not necessarily create better care for all patients with brain disorders but that trainees in both fields would benefit from increased training in the complementary specialty. The new Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education clinical neuroscience milestones for psychiatry training and psychiatry milestones for neurology training are steps in the right direction. Increasing opportunities for combined neurology-psychiatry training will help create a cadre of specialists equipped to efficiently care for complex patients within emerging accountable care organizations. Drawing from two fields in the service of understanding brain-behavior interactions increases the potential for innovation at their interface. The author concludes that the time has come to increase the neurological and neuroscience content of psychiatry training but not to unite the two fields."}, {"Title": "Beyond neural cubism: promoting a multidimensional view of brain disorders by enhancing the integration of neurology and psychiatry in education.", "Abstract": "Cubism was an influential early-20th-century art movement characterized by angular, disjointed imagery. The two-dimensional appearance of Cubist figures and objects is created through juxtaposition of angles. The authors posit that the constrained perspectives found in Cubism may also be found in the clinical classification of brain disorders. Neurological disorders are often separated from psychiatric disorders as if they stemmed from different organ systems. Maintaining two isolated clinical disciplines fractionalizes the brain in the same way that Pablo Picasso fractionalized figures and objects in his Cubist art. This Neural Cubism perpetuates a clinical divide that does not reflect the scope and depth of neuroscience. All brain disorders are complex and multidimensional, with aberrant circuitry and resultant psychopharmacology manifesting as altered behavior, affect, mood, or cognition. Trainees should receive a multidimensional education based on modern neuroscience, not a partial education based on clinical precedent. The authors briefly outline the rationale for increasing the integration of neurology and psychiatry and discuss a nested model with which clinical neuroscientists (neurologists and psychiatrists) can approach and treat brain disorders."}, {"Title": "Internet treatment addressing either insomnia or depression, for patients with both diagnoses: a randomized trial.", "Abstract": "To compare treatment effects when patients with insomnia and depression receive treatment for either insomnia or depression.\nA 9-w randomized controlled trial with 6- and 12-mo follow-up.\nInternet Psychiatry Clinic, Stockholm, Sweden.\nForty-three adults in whom comorbid insomnia and depression were diagnosed, recruited via media and assessed by psychiatrists.\nGuided Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) for either insomnia or depression.\nPrimary outcome measures were symptom self-rating scales (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] and the Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS-S]), assessed before and after treatment with follow-up after 6 and 12 mo. The participants' use of sleep medication and need for further treatment after completion of ICBT was also investigated. The insomnia treatment was more effective than the depression treatment in reducing insomnia severity during treatment (P = 0.05), and equally effective in reducing depression severity. Group differences in insomnia severity were maintained during the 12-mo follow-up period. Post treatment, participants receiving treatment for insomnia had significantly less self-rated need for further insomnia treatment (P < 0.001) and used less sleep medication (P < 0.05) than participants receiving treatment for depression. The need for depression treatment was similar in both groups.\nIn this study, Internet-delivered treatment with cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) for insomnia was more effective than ICBT for depression for patients with both diagnoses.

Psychiatric assessment is often considered the \"gold standard\" for diagnosis, therefore how psychiatrists conceptualize depression in this setting is pertinent. Our study aimed to investigate this issue.\nPsychiatrists working in palliative care in Australia were individually interviewed using a semistructured approach. Nine participants were interviewed to reach data saturation. Interview transcripts were analyzed for themes.\nThree overarching themes were identified: (1) depression means different things; (2) depression is conceptualized using different models; and (3) depression is the same concept within and outside of the palliative care setting. Participants explicitly articulated the heterogeneous nature of depression and described a different breadths of concepts, ranging from a narrow construct of a depressive illness to a broader one that encompassed depressive symptoms and emotions. However, depressive illness was a consistent concept, and participants considered this in terms of phenotypic subtypes. Participants used three models (spectral, dichotomous, and mixed) to relate various depressive presentations.\nPsychiatrists did not subscribe to a unitary model of depression but understood it as a heterogeneous concept comprised of depressive illness and other less clearly defined depressive presentations. Given the influence of psychiatric opinion in the area of depression, these findings may serve as a platform for further discussions to refine the concepts of depression in the palliative care setting, which in turn may improve diagnostic and treatment outcomes."}, {"Title": "Do all children with suicidal ideation receive a significant psychiatric intervention?", "Abstract": "In most physicians' minds, suicidal ideation carries with it an ominous prognosis requiring intensive evaluation and treatment.

Suicidal children were those who had expressed suicidal ideation. Significant psychiatric intervention was defined as one of the following: hospitalization in a psychiatric facility, period of observation in the ED (\u2265 12 h), use of restraints, and prescription of psychiatric medication. Suicidal labeling was considered appropriate if one or more of the aforementioned interventions were recommended by a psychiatrist. The presence of psychiatric intervention was compared with that in children who presented with a behavioral disorder, not labeled as suicidal. Chi-squared or Fisher's exact test, whenever appropriate, was used to evaluate the association between suicide status and intervention.\nA total of 160 children (27.1%) were labeled as suicidal, and 431 (72.9%) with a behavioral disorder were classified as non-suicidal. A total of 244/431 (56.6%) in the non-suicidal group had a significant psychiatric intervention compared to 79/160 (49.4%) in the suicidal ideation group (P = 0.116). This 49.4% is significantly different from an a priori assumption that 100% of children with suicidal ideation would have a significant psychiatric intervention.\nMore than half (50.6%) of the children presenting with a label of suicidal ideation did not receive significant psychiatric intervention.

One challenge undermining these efforts is the relatively poor predictive accuracy of clinical assessments used in practice for CHR individuals, often leading to diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty reflected in clinical guidelines promoting a 'watch and wait' approach to CHR patients. Using data from published studies, and employing predictive models based on the odds-ratio form of Bayes' rule, we simulated scenarios where clinical interview, neurocognitive testing, structural magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiology are part of the initial assessment process of a CHR individual (extended diagnostic approach). Our findings indicate that for most at-risk patients, at least three of these assessments are necessary to arrive at a clinically meaningful differentiation into high- intermediate-, and low-risk groups. In particular, patients with equivocal results in the initial assessments require additional diagnostic testing to produce an accurate risk profile forming part of the comprehensive initial assessment. The findings may inform future research into reliable identification and personalized therapeutic targeting of CHR patients, to prevent transition to full-blown psychosis."}, {"Title": "Outcomes of a Freedom of Choice Reform in Community Mental Health Day Center Services.", "Abstract": "A freedom-of-choice reform within mental health day center services was evaluated.

The aim of this study was to validate the Italian version of the CANFOR-staff tool.\nAfter translation and back-translation, the Italian CANFOR tool was administered to a sample of 50 forensic psychiatric patients. Convergent validity was tested using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) by applying Kendall's tau-b. Inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities were measured by ICCs for need dimensions (total and unmet) and Cohen's kappa coefficients for individual need items.\nRegarding convergent validity, a higher number of needs (total and unmet) were associated with more severe psychiatric symptoms (BPRS). Higher numbers of unmet needs were also associated with lower levels of global functioning (GAF). ICCs for total and unmet needs scores indicated a good level of agreement for inter-rater reliability and a very good level for test-retest, respectively. Regarding the specific items, inter-rater Cohen's kappa was high (moderate to very good agreement) for 18 items in relation to the presence of a need and for 15 items in the rating of an unmet need, whereas Cohen's kappa for test-retest reliability was very high for all the items in the presence of a need and high for 18 of the unmet need domains.\nThe Italian version of CANFOR has adequate psychometric properties.

We analyzed the data using latent class analysis approach.\nWe found four patterns of familial psychopathology. Latent homogeneous subsets of patients due to familial characteristics were as paternal kinship psychopathology with schizophrenia, paternal kinship psychopathology with mood disorders, maternal kinship psychopathology and core family psychopathology.\nFamily patterns were critical to exerting variation in psychiatric disorders of probands and affected relatives.

Thus, we can observe how the primate learns and develops psycho-cognitive functions through experiences in experimental environment for a much shorter period compared to that of humans. Longer daylight exposure may affect psychological development of children. In our research, we focus on raising marmosets under constant daylight from birth until various ages. In order to quantitatively evaluate the development of higher-ordered psychological functions, we designed a system of socio-behavioral tests and multivariate correlation analysis methods based on principal component analysis. With reference to the call and typical body movement expressed during a particular social context, we statistically inferred the emotional features of the subjects. In the current literature, we review our published results showing increased alert behaviors by constant light, and then, attempted to extend our additional analysis to seek age-dependent susceptibility to constant light.

I would advocate an alternative interpretation of the truth status of diagnostic classifications that leads to different conclusions. This is based firstly on Karl Popper's ideas on the growth of knowledge, whereby hypotheses developed from theoretical conjectures are deliberately subjected to attempts at refutation (we refine our always provisional views of what is true by increasing our knowledge of what is false). My second source of argument is John Wing's view that diseases are theoretical constructs on which disease theories may be based and tested. Such theories relate variously to aetiology, pathology, treatment, course and outcome. Rejecting a disease theory does not force rejection of the disease construct it seeks to qualify. We adhere to disease constructs more strongly than to the disease theories based on them. However, if it becomes apparent that the information obtained by testing disease theories is incoherent, we may eventually jettison particular disease constructs, as has happened regularly in the history of medicine.

Medical and socio-environmental aspects of mental suffering].", "Abstract": "A disease concept should be broad enough to provide social protection for all subjects suffering from this malady but at the same time it needs to be narrow enough to avoid pathologization of behavior that is merely socially undesirable. From a medical perspective a\"disease\" is present if functions are impaired that are relevant for individual survival. In the field of psychiatry and psychotherapy, such medically relevant functions include the ability to be alert and fully oriented, to ascribe one's own intentions to oneself and to modulate affects according to the situation. Beyond such medically relevant symptoms of a disease, any clinically relevant dysfunction should also be harmful for the individual if a mental malady is to be diagnosed. One such harmful consequence of a disease can be that the person feels ill and suffers from this state, another negative consequence for the individual can be due to an impairment of activities of daily living and social participation. These harmful consequences of a disease are usually discussed under the heading of the\"illness experience\" and the\"sickness aspect\" of any disorder. Beyond mental maladies characterized by disease symptoms that are accompanied either by an illness experience or impaired activities of daily living and social participation (sickness), there are many states of human suffering which can be objectified and classified but do not constitute a disease in the medical sense and should more aptly be named a disorder."}, {"Title": "Novel directions for G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E analysis in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E in psychiatry may explain why environmental risk factors have big impact in some individuals but not in others, and conversely why relatives that are genetically at risk for disease do not all develop disease.

In addition, clinical responses to treatment were evaluated with tests of cognitive functions before and after a course of ECT. Adverse effects were recorded.\nThe sociodemographic characteristics of the 3 treatment groups were similar. There were no significant differences among the groups in terms of effects on cardiovascular system variables, seizure variables, and cognitive functions.

This refers to the tradition of nursing theory development, where a central core concept identified from the integrated data-in this case, interviews and the literature content-had to be defined. A major focus of the study was to distinguish spirituality from religion. The denotative and connotative meanings of \"spirituality\" were explored to establish the components for a definition. The attributes of this definition included that spirituality constitutes a \"quality\", a \"journey\", a \"relationship\" as well as a \"capacity\". While these items derived from this local definition of spirituality can be proposed for inclusion in a questionnaire for measuring spirituality in a South African context, the limits of the scope of the explorative qualitative inquiry from which it was derived must be considered."}, {"Title": "Investigation of the genetic interaction between BDNF and DRD3 genes in suicidical behaviour in psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Suicide is a serious public health concern, and it is partly genetic.

Specifically, a larger proportion of SCZ patients who were carrying at least one copy of the minor allele at each of the Val66Met and Ser9Gly functional markers have attempted suicides compared to patients with other genotypes (Bonferroni P < 0.05).

The origins of this pathology involve multiple genes as well as environmental and developmental factors leading to a disorder that remains difficult to treat. Several therapies for depression have been developed and these mainly target monoamine neurotransmitters. However, these treatments are not only associated with numerous adverse effects, but they are also ineffective for more than one-third of patients. Therefore, the need to develop new concepts to treat depression is crucial. Recently, studies using knockout mouse models have provided evidence for a crucial role of two members of the two-pore domain potassium channel (K2P ) family, tandem P-domain weak inward rectifying K(+) (TWIK)-related K(+) channel 1 (TREK-1) and TWIK-related acid-sensitive K(+) channel 3 (TASK-3) in the pathophysiology of depression. It is believed that TREK-1 and TASK-3 antagonists could lead to the development of new antidepressants. Herein, we describe the discovery of spadin, a natural peptide released from the maturation of the neurotensin receptor-3 (also known as sortilin), which specifically blocks the activity of the TREK-1 channel and displays particular antidepressant properties, with a rapid onset of action and the absence of adverse effects. The development of such molecules may open a new era in the field of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Screening for alcohol and substance use for older people in geriatric hospital and community health settings.", "Abstract": "We aimed to determine the rates of alcohol and substance use in geriatric hospital and community health settings, and to evaluate the performance of screening instruments.\nA two-phase cross-sectional study was undertaken in geriatric and aged care psychiatry wards and associated community services of a teaching hospital.

The adult form of the disease is usually expressed as a neurological form. Non-specific psychiatric symptoms are often associated with NPC. For some cases, it can also be expressed as an isolated psychiatric disorder form. Since 2009, the launching of a medicine called miglustat has helped to improve the disease evolution.\nWe report two siblings followed-up in the same department of psychiatry and with an atypical psychotic symptomatology. Case 1 is a 27-year-old French male. He was hospitalised several times due to disordered behaviour, psychomotor excitation, mood instability and wandering. He was originally diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, the patient's psychosis proved refractory to treatment. He also exhibited a number of neurological signs (pyramidal signs and abnormal movements of the hands, head and limbs), which were considered related to his antipsychotic medication. Three years later, a full physical, neurological and neuropsychological examination revealed various neurological and visceral symptoms. He was diagnosed with NPC based on a classical biochemical NPC-phenotype following filipin staining in cultured skin fibroblasts. NPC1 gene sequencing revealed that he was a compound heterozygote for the p.S954L and p.N1156S mutations. The patient's psychiatric and neurological symptoms are currently stabilized by miglustat, allowing the patient to cease antipsychotic medication. Case 2 is the elder sister of Case 1. She was hospitalised several times due to acute delirium, hallucinations and suicidal tendencies. She was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at 22 years of age. She has received a variety of typical and atypical antipsychotics. Many of these drugs proved initially effective but the patient's symptoms repeatedly returned. The patient shows persistent and worsening gait disorder and abnormal arm movements. A follow-up neurological examination at age 29 did not detect any ataxia, cataplexy or vertical supra-nuclear gaze palsy. Direct NPC1 gene sequencing detected a mutant NPC1 allele held in common with her brother, but full sequencing of both the NPC1 and NPC2 genes and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) did not detect any other pathogenic mutation or other anomalies.\nBecause NPC is an autosomal recessive condition, heterozygous individuals carrying only one causal gene mutation are usually asymptomatic. Thus, while the accepted wisdom would suggest that patient 2 is not affected by the disease, it is interesting to consider why she has developed neurological and psychiatric disorders like her brother. Several hypotheses are discussed: mental expression in heterozygous genetic factor predisposing to schizophrenia, comorbidity or fortuitous association. It is not currently known whether a patient with a single NPC gene mutation can express NPC in full, partially, or perhaps just to a minimal degree. This case of a patient with a heterozygous \"carrier\" NPC genotype and neuropsychiatric disorders suggestive of the disease raises the possibility that symptomatic heterozygous NPC patients may exist. On the other hand, if the heterozygous genotype of patient 2 does not give rise to symptomatic disease, it is pertinent to question whether it could be a predisposing factor for the development of psychiatric pathologies. There are currently no published data on the occurrence of heterozygous NPC1 or NPC2 mutations among patients with atypical psychiatric presentations combined with neurological symptoms. Conversely, there are no published data demonstrating an increased frequency of psychiatric disorders in families affected by NPC. Finally, in view of the history of psychiatric disorders in this family, it is possible that psychosis simply occurred concomitantly with symptomatic NPC in patient 1 by chance, and that schizophrenia occurred simultaneously with an asymptomatic NPC carrier genotype in patient 2. To investigate this further, NPC patients' carrier family members (parents and siblings) should be fully screened for signs suggestive of the disease."}, {"Title": "[Bipolar disorder and quality of life: A cross-sectional study including 104 Tunisian patients].", "Abstract": "Bipolar disorder affects many psychosocial and functional aspects, leading to a real social handicap and an alteration in quality of life.\nTo evaluate bipolar patients' quality of life and to identify the risk factors responsible for a deterioration.\nOur cross-sectional study lasted for four months and included 104 bipolar patients treated at the psychiatry consultation of the university hospital in Mahdia. The data were collected through a questionnaire composed of 52 items exploring the general characteristics of subjects, the clinical and evolutional characteristics of bipolar disorder and providing information on the treatment. Quality of life was measured using the SF-36 (Short form) generic scale. A global average score was calculated and it was considered that quality of life was altered if the score was less than 66.7, according to the threshold value of L\u00e9an. Moreover, an average score was calculated for each dimension, thus permitting us to identify those most affected. We standardized initial average scores.\nThe assessment of quality of life revealed a global average of 52.2 and an alteration in 78.8% of patients. The study of the dimensional average scores revealed that all dimensions were affected. The standardization also revealed deterioration in all dimensions, the mental component being particularly more affected than the physical component with respectively estimated scores of 31.7 and 40.5. The analytic approach concerned the relationship between qualitative and quantitative variables and the occurrence of an alteration in quality of life. For this effect, a bivariate study displayed a statistically significant correlation between the eight dimensions of the SF-36 and 8 variables. In order to take into account the relationships that link each variable to the others, and to avoid the bias of the bivariate study, a logistic regression analysis was performed. Only 4 variables with discriminating weight emerged from this analysis. According to the number of dimensions affected, the following factors were classified in decreasing order: absence of leisure activities, lack of stable budgetary resources, absence of professional activity and the association of a psychotropic medication.\nThis clinimetric approach permitted us to consider the global life of each patient suffering from bipolar disorder."}, {"Title": "Mining approximate temporal functional dependencies with pure temporal grouping in clinical databases.", "Abstract": "Functional dependencies (FDs) typically represent associations over facts stored by a database, such as \"patients with the same symptom get the same therapy.\" In more recent years, some extensions have been introduced to represent both temporal constraints (temporal functional dependencies - TFDs), as \"for any given month, patients with the same symptom must have the same therapy, but their therapy may change from one month to the next one,\" and approximate properties (approximate functional dependencies - AFDs), as \"patients with the same symptomgenerallyhave the same therapy.\" An AFD holds most of the facts stored by the database, enabling some data to deviate from the defined property: the percentage of data which violate the given property is user-defined. According to this scenario, in this paper we introduce approximate temporal functional dependencies (ATFDs) and use them to mine clinical data. Specifically, we considered the need for deriving new knowledge from psychiatric and pharmacovigilance data. ATFDs may be defined and measured either on temporal granules (e.g.grouping data by day, week, month, year) or on sliding windows (e.g.a fixed-length time interval which moves over the time axis): in this regard, we propose and discuss some specific and efficient data mining techniques for ATFDs. We also developed two running prototypes and showed the feasibility of our proposal by mining two real-world clinical data sets.

The focus of neurology remained the diagnosis and treatment of aphasias and epilepsies, while cognitive impairments and developmental disorders were classified as functional (psychological) disorders. Geschwind was troubled by the fact that many of the patients he saw with neurological deficits also presented with behavioral (developmental) disorders. Geschwind's generation also had been taught that aphasias resulted from global rather than localized or focal neurological lesions. These holists, including the prepsychoanalytic Sigmund Freud, targeted the work of aphasiologist Carl Wernicke as an exemplar of the flaws of the localizationist hypothesis. Reading Wernicke in the original, Geschwind discovered a complex and multilayered explanation for aphasias that implicated lesions located in association pathways that, when extensive, resulted in behavioral disorders. Geschwind also reread the works of the holists, discovering that, while their rhetoric rejected Wernicke, their explanations of aphasias actually reinforced Wernicke's hypothesis. Building on his reading of these historical documents and his clinical experiences, Geschwind urged the resurrection of Wernicke's disconnection syndromes that Geschwind labeled as Behavioral Neurology."}, {"Title": "The media campaign on the DSM-5: recurring comments and lessons for the future of diagnosis in psychiatric practice.", "Abstract": "Recurring arguments in the media campaign preceding and following the publication of the DSM-5 have been that the manual, referred to as 'the bible of psychiatry', mislabels many people who are basically normal, and that the diagnostic categories it contains are invalid, not being based on laboratory tests.

CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 genotyping have limited current clinical utility. CYP2C9 genotyping has no utility in psychiatry. Psychiatrists should master tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) prescription, and if they use TCAs, they should have expertise in CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotyping and in TCA therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to safely dose TCAs. Practice guidelines recommend dose changes, TDM or alternate drugs for (1) CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers (UM) taking citalopram or escitalopram; (2) CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (PMs) taking sertraline; (3) CYP2D6 PMs taking venlafaxine, aripiprazole, haloperidol, risperidone or zuclopenthixol; and (4) CYP2D6 UMs taking venlafaxine, aripiprazole, haloperidol, risperidone, zuclopenthixol or atomoxetine. According to the prescribing information, CYP2D6 PMs should receive 75\u00a0% of the average long-acting aripiprazole dose and pimozide doses >4\u00a0mg/day should not be prescribed without CYP2D6 genotyping. In a situation of limited evidence, there is need to use the available pharmacological mechanistic information for better personalizing treatment in psychiatry. This is best done by combining CYP genotyping with TDM.

The aim of the study is to compare these approaches and evaluate their aptitude to differentiate among child and adolescent mental healthcare providers regarding their treatment outcome. Comparing outcomes according to continuous and categorical outcome indicators using real-life data of seven mental healthcare providers, three using the Child Behavior Checklist and four using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire as primary outcome measure. Within each dataset consistent differences were found between providers and the various methods led to comparable rankings of providers. Statistical considerations designate continuous outcomes as the optimal choice. Change scores have more statistical power and allow for a ranking of providers at first glance. Expressing providers' performance in proportions of recovered, changed, unchanged, or deteriorated patients has supplementary value, as it denotes outcome in a manner more easily interpreted and appreciated by clinicians, managerial staff, and, last but not least, by patients or their parents."}, {"Title": "Comparison of Segmental Colon Transit Time With Total Energy Expenditure in Psychiatry Unit Patients.", "Abstract": "Physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.

The participants used an accelerometer for 7 days to measure their 1-week TEE. They took a capsule containing 20 radio-opaque markers for 3 days. On the 4th day and 7th day, a supine abdominal radiography was performed. According to the TEE of all study participants, the upper 30%, middle 30%, and lower 40% were classified into groups according to high (H), moderate (M), and low (L) physical activity. The mean total CTT was 52.0 hours. The segmental CTT for the right, left, and recto-sigmoid colon were 15.3 hours, 19.2 hours, and 17.4 hours. Total CTT in the H group was significantly shorter than that in the L group (p = .010). A comparison of the segmental CTT between the L, M, and H groups showed that the right CTT (p = .010) of the H group was significantly shorter than that of the M group. The left CTT of the M group (p = .028) and H group (p = .004) was significantly shorter than that of the L group.

In the context of central nervous system development, such sensitive periods shape the formation of neurocircuits that mediate, regulate, and control behavior. This general mechanism allows for development to be guided by both the genetic blueprint as well as the environmental context. While allowing for adaptation, such sensitive periods are also vulnerability windows during which external and internal factors can confer risk to disorders by derailing otherwise resilient developmental programs. Here we review developmental periods that are sensitive to monoamine signaling and impact adult behaviors of relevance to psychiatry. Specifically, we review (1) a serotonin-sensitive period that impacts sensory system development, (2) a serotonin-sensitive period that impacts cognition, anxiety- and depression-related behaviors, and (3) a dopamine- and serotonin-sensitive period affecting aggression, impulsivity and behavioral response to psychostimulants. We discuss preclinical data to provide mechanistic insight, as well as epidemiological and clinical data to point out translational relevance. The field of translational developmental neuroscience has progressed exponentially providing solid conceptual advances and unprecedented mechanistic insight. With such knowledge at hand and important methodological innovation ongoing, the field is poised for breakthroughs elucidating the developmental origins of neuropsychiatric disorders, and thus understanding pathophysiology. Such knowledge of sensitive periods that determine the developmental trajectory of complex behaviors is a necessary step towards improving prevention and treatment approaches for neuropsychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Intelligence is in the eye of the beholder: investigating repeated IQ measurements in forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "A stable assessment of cognition is of paramount importance for forensic psychiatric patients (FPP).

Focusing on resilience rather than pathophysiology in many ways represents a paradigm shift in clinical-psychological and psychiatric research that has great potential for the development of new prevention and treatment strategies. More recently, research into resilience also arrived in the neurobiological community, posing nontrivial questions about ecological validity and translatability. Drawing on concepts and findings from transdiagnostic psychiatry, emotion research, and behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, we propose a unified theoretical framework for the neuroscientific study of general resilience mechanisms. The framework is applicable to both animal and human research and supports the design and interpretation of translational studies. The theory emphasizes the causal role of stimulus appraisal (evaluation) processes in the generation of emotional responses, including responses to potential stressors. On this basis, it posits that a positive (non-negative) appraisal style is the key mechanism that protects against the detrimental effects of stress and mediates the effects of other known resilience factors. Appraisal style is shaped by three classes of cognitive processes--positive situation classification, reappraisal, and interference inhibition--that can be investigated at the neural level.

Despite rigorous clinical research demonstrating its equivalence and effectiveness relative to face-to-face care, many providers are unfamiliar with this technology. Training residents in telepsychiatry is critical to building mental health care capacity in rural and underserviced communities. However, many questions remain regarding the competencies that future psychiatrists require with respect to telepsychiatry, and technology generally, and regarding pedagogical approaches that will promote their attainment. This literature review aims to elucidate evidence-based approaches to developing residents' competence to practice telepsychiatry.\nThe authors conducted a literature search of telepsychiatry training for psychiatry residents. The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane, and ERIC using subject headings and keywords; and hand searched reference lists, forward citations of relevant articles, and tables of contents of relevant journals. Articles were included if they were in English, discussed teaching psychiatry residents to provide direct or indirect clinical care via real-time videoconferencing technology, and were published by January 2014.\nIn total, 215 unique references yielded 20 relevant publications. The literature on graduate training in telepsychiatry is sparse, heterogeneous, and primarily descriptive. Even brief learning experiences may increase the likelihood that residents will incorporate telepsychiatry into their future practice. Training should address competencies that are (1) technical, (2) collaborative/interprofessional, and (3) administrative. Training typically consists of supervised provision of clinical care to build modality-specific clinical skills and may also include didactic teaching to provide health systems and transcultural and medicolegal perspectives.\nA more evidence-based approach to telepsychiatry training is needed, including an assessment of residents' learning needs, use of multiple learning modalities, and evaluations of educational curricula.

This leaves open, however, the neural mechanisms that provide the temporal linkage or glue between the various contents, the transitive parts that makes possible the \"stream of consciousness.\" Interestingly, schizophrenic patients seem to suffer from abnormalities specifically in the \"transitive parts\" when they experience contents as temporally disconnected or fragmented which in phenomenological psychiatry has been described as \"temporal fragmentation.\" The aim of this article is to develop so-called neurophenomenal hypothesis about the direct relationship between phenomenal features of the \"stream of consciousness,\" the \"transitive parts,\" and the specific neuronal mechanisms in schizophrenia as based on healthy subjects. Rather than emphasizing stimulus-induced and task-evoked activity and sensory and lateral prefrontal cortical regions as in neurocognitive approaches with their focus on the \"substantive parts,\" the focus shifts here to the brain's intrinsic activity, its resting state activity, which may account for the temporal linkage or glue between the contents of consciousness, the transitive parts."}, {"Title": "The importance of code status discussions in the psychiatric hospital: results of a single site survey of psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "Documentation of code status is a requirement with hospital admission, yet this discussion may present unique challenges with psychiatric inpatients.

On multivariate analysis, a 'poor' self-evaluation of referral to the prescriber was significantly associated with the following perceptions: 'insufficient confidence in communication with prescribers' (odds ratio [OR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.4-5.3), and 'to avoid trouble with prescribers' (OR, 1.7; 95%CI: 1.0-2.7).\nJapanese community pharmacists could prevent prescription drug abuse in their practice, but the pharmacists who have insufficient confidence in communication with prescribers and who are afraid of trouble with a prescriber, reported poor self-evaluation for referral to the prescribers. All prescribers should understand the importance of referral by community pharmacists, to assist community pharmacists in playing a critical role in prevention of prescription drug abuse."}, {"Title": "The genetic and epigenetic landscape for CNS drug discovery targeting cross-diagnostic behavioral domains.", "Abstract": "Animal studies play a central role in the identification and testing of novel drugs for CNS disorders.

Psychiatric investigations as to why a son might murder his mother yield indications of a high rate of mental illness, primarily psychotic disorders, in perpetrators. In an attempt to gain an in-depth understanding of the role of the mother-son bond in the etiology of matricide by mentally disordered sons, this article presents a qualitative study of nine cases of matricide examined at two Italian Forensic Psychiatry Departments between 2005 and 2010 and retrospective analysis of forensic psychiatry reports on the offenders. Most matricides suffered from psychotic disorders, especially schizophrenia. Nevertheless, not all the perpetrators had psychotic symptoms at the time of the crime. A \"pathologic\" mother-son bond was found in all cases. However, mental illness is not the only variable related to matricide and, taken alone, is not enough to explain the crime. Several factors in the history of the mother and son need to be probed, especially how their relationship developed over the years. The peculiar dynamics of the mother-son relationship and the unique personalities and life experiences of both subjects are the real key to cases of matricide."}, {"Title": "Prevalence, impact and cultural context of psychotic experiences among ethnic minority youth.", "Abstract": "The risk for psychotic disorders is increased for many ethnic minority groups and may develop in early childhood. This study investigated whether the prevalence of psychotic experiences (PE) with high impact is higher among ethnic minority youth compared to majority youth and examined the significance of these PE.\nA school-based study assessed a large community sample of 1545 ethnic minority and majority children in The Netherlands (mean age 12.98 \u00b1 1.81 years). The Dutch (n = 702, 45.4%), Moroccan-Dutch (n = 400, 25.9%) and Turkish-Dutch (n = 170, 11.0%) ethnic groups could be studied separately. Self-report questionnaires on PE, impact and cultural context were administered.\nPrevalence of PE with high impact was 3.1% in Dutch, 9.5% in Moroccan-Dutch and 7.1% in Turkish-Dutch youth. Compared to Dutch youth, odds ratios were 3.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-5.1] for Moroccan-Dutch youth and 2.2 (95% CI 1.1-4.6) for Turkish-Dutch youth. Differences were not explained by cultural or religious differences.\nThe increased risk for psychotic disorders in ethnic minorities may already be detectable in childhood, since PE with high impact were more common among ethnic minority youth compared to majority youth. The additional measurement of impact of PE appears to be a valid approach to identify those children at risk to develop psychotic or other more common psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "How do we keep our residents safe? An educational intervention.", "Abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that 25-64 % of psychiatry residents are the victims of assault by patients; only a minority, however, feel they receive adequate safety and violence training during residency. To address this disparity, the author designed, implemented, and assessed the effectiveness of a brief educational intervention focused on improving the residents' ability to recognize violence risk and increase attention to safety in the psychiatric interview.\nThe subjects were 13 second-year psychiatry residents. Effectiveness was evaluated via the assessment of the residents' written responses describing their first clinical intervention after hearing a case vignette of a potentially violent patient (before and 1 month following the intervention). Responses were evaluated for any evidence of concerns for safety.\nThe number of residents citing safety concerns increased (38 to 92 %), as did the level of sophistication in their proposed interventions.\nA brief educational intervention focused on violence risk and interview safety may be effective in increasing residents' attention to safety concerns in their clinical care, and further work will be beneficial to confirm and expand upon these findings."}, {"Title": "Vicarious traumatization and coping in medical students: a pilot study.", "Abstract": "This study explored the impact of traumatic experiences on medical students during their clerkships.\nMedical students completed an anonymous online survey inquiring about traumatic experiences on required clerkships during their third year of medical school, including any symptoms they may have experienced as well as coping strategies they may have used.\nTwenty-six percent of students reported experiencing vicarious traumatization (VT) during their third year of medical school.\nThe experience of VT in medical students is relevant to medical educators, given that the resulting symptoms may impact student performance and learning as well as ongoing well-being.

This problem is particularly severe in certain subspecialties such as geriatrics in general and geriatric psychiatry in particular. This study sought to obtain medical students' perspectives on barriers and facilitators toward pursuing a career in academics and/or in geriatric psychiatry or geriatic medicine.\nThe study surveyed 27 first-year medical students from six US medical schools, who had demonstrated a clear interest in academic geriatrics by completing a mentored summer research training program in geriatric medicine or geriatric psychiatry, funded by the National Institute on Aging. The survey included open-ended and close-ended questions about likely career choice and factors affecting it.\nSixty percent of students reported they were likely to pursue an academic career, 44 % a career in geriatric psychiatry or geriatic medicine, and only 36 % a career in academic geriatrics. The most frequently perceived barriers were a lack of knowledge about academic careers and lack of exposure to geriatrics, financial concerns due to loan debts and low compensation, and negative impressions of research and of working with older adults. Facilitators included positive experiences with or positive impressions of research and research mentors and of older adults, and the growing demand for geriatric care.\nAttracting capable and motivated medical students to academic careers in fields such as geriatric psychiatry or geriatic medicine should be a priority in seeking to expand the number of physician scientists and to add to the health-care workforce in underserved subspecialty areas. Necessary approaches should include opportunities to work in academic settings; availability of sustained and dedicated mentorship; early, consistent, and positive exposure to older adults; and financial incentives."}, {"Title": "Anti-social personality characteristics and psychotic symptoms: Two pathways associated with offending in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Several research groups have shown that people with schizophrenia who offend do not form a homogenous group. A three-group model claimed by Hodgins proposes distinguishing between people who start offending before the onset of psychosis (early starters), after psychosis onset but at age 34\u2009years or under (late starters) and after psychosis onset but at age 35\u2009years or older (late first offenders).\nThis study aimed to test the hypotheses (1) that the personality of early starters and non-psychotic offenders would be similar, but different from either late-starter group; (2) that the late-starter groups would be more likely to have positive psychotic symptoms than non-criminal patients with schizophrenia; and (3) that symptom types would differentiate the psychotic groups.\nA retrospective file study was conducted on cases of 97 early starters, 100 late starters and 26 late first offenders all drawn from the Netherlands Institute of Forensic Psychiatry and Psychology (NIFP) archives 1993-2008, 115 non-psychotic offenders from 2005-2008 NIFP archives and 129 patients with schizophrenia and no criminal history from one general service in Rotterdam.\nEarly starters closely resembled the non-psychotic offenders in their premorbid anti-social personality characteristics. The two late-onset offending psychosis groups were more likely to have persecutory and/or grandiose delusions than non-offenders with psychosis, but so were the early starters.\nIn a first study to compare subgroups of offenders with psychosis directly with non-psychotic offenders and non-offenders with psychosis, we found such additional support for a distinction between early and late starters with psychosis that different treatment strategies would seem indicated, focusing on personality and substance misuse for the former but psychotic symptoms for all. It remains to be seen whether the higher rate of alcohol misuse amongst late first offenders is a fundamental distinction or a function of age difference."}, {"Title": "Risk factors for polyuria in a cross-section of community psychiatric lithium-treated patients.", "Abstract": "Polyuria increases the risk of dehydration and lithium toxicity in lithium-treated patients. Risk factors have been inconsistently described and the variance of this adverse effect remains poorly understood. This study aimed to establish independent risk factors for polyuria in a community, secondary-level lithium-treated sample of patients.\nThis was a cross-sectional study of the lithium-treated patients attending a general adult and an old age psychiatry service. Participants completed a 24-hour urine collection. Urine volume and the presence of polyuria were the outcomes of interest. The relationship between outcome and the participant's demographic and clinical characteristics was explored with univariable and multivariable analysis.\nA total of 122 participants were included in the analysis, with 38% being diagnosed with polyuria. Female gender and increased body weight independently predicted the presence of polyuria (standardized regression coefficient 1.01 and 0.94, respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.003, respectively). Female gender and increased body weight, lithium dose, and duration of lithium treatment independently predicted higher 24-hour urine volumes (standardized regression coefficients 0.693, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0005; 0.791, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0005; 0.276, p\u00a0=\u00a00.043; 0.181, p\u00a0=\u00a00.034, respectively). Of three different weight metrics, lean body weight was the most predictive.\nFemale gender and increased body weight explain part of the variance of this adverse effect.

Questions addressed awareness of changes in accessibility of psychiatric documentation, which parts of the psychiatric note were most useful, and ways in which reviewing psychiatric notes changed providers' practice and perception of patients with mental illness.\nSurvey return rate was 100 % due to in-person distribution and collection of survey. More than half (58 %) of respondents were unaware that they had access to psychiatric notes. Within the psychiatric note, providers focused most on plan, diagnosis, and assessment components. Those who were aware reported improved understanding (97 %) and comfort with discussing mental illness (79 %), increased consideration of side effects of psychiatric medications (79 %), and improved efficiency in encounters with psychiatric patients (97 %). Responses about likelihood to contact psychiatrists directly varied considerably. About 45 % of respondents were more likely to consider psychosomatic etiology for patients who were also seen by outpatient psychiatry.\nOverall, PCPs reported that accessibility of outpatient psychiatric notes significantly enhanced their experience of caring for patients with mental illness. Future goals include increasing awareness and education about availability of psychiatric notes as well as optimizing communication between psychiatrists and PCPs. The authors recommend future studies focused on changes in perceptions among providers as a result of continued use of psychiatric documentation."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry and NS euthanasia.

This study evaluated a pilot communication skills education program for psychiatry trainees, focusing on discussing schizophrenia diagnosis and prognosis.\nCommunication skills training modules were developed based on an existing theoretical framework (ComSkil), adapted for discussing a schizophrenia diagnosis and prognosis. Pre-post training rating of self-reported confidence in a range of communication tasks was obtained, along with trainee views on the training methods.\nThirty-eight participants completed the training. Significant improvements in confidence were reported post training for discussing schizophrenia prognosis, including an increased capacity to critically evaluate their own communication skills. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the program.\nThis preliminary study provides support for the translation of a well-established educational model to psychiatric training addressing core clinical communication tasks and provides the foundation for the development of a more comprehensive evaluation and an extended curriculum regarding other aspects of care for patients with schizophrenia: ongoing management and recovery, dealing with conflict, and conducting a family interview."}, {"Title": "A national survey of eating disorder training.", "Abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) result in the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric disorders, and in the United States, approximately one in twenty females suffers from an eating disorder.

The Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY) has been shown to have good reliability and validity in a range of settings but has hardly been studied in adolescent mental health services.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the long-term predictive validity of the SAVRY in adolescent psychiatry settings.\nIn a prospective study, 200 SAVRY assessments of adolescents were acquired from psychiatric, forensic and correctional settings. Re-offending records from the Finnish National Crime Register were collected. Receiver operating curve statistics were applied.\nHigh SAVRY total and individual subscale scores and low values on the protective factor subscale were significantly associated with subsequent adverse outcomes, but the predictive value of the total score was weak. At the risk item level, those indicating antisocial lifestyle, absence of social support and pro-social involvement were strong indicators of subsequent criminal convictions, with or without violence. The SAVRY summary risk rating was the best indicator of likelihood of being convicted of a violent crime. After allowing for sex, age, psychiatric diagnosis and treatment setting, for example, conviction for a violent crime was over nine times more likely among those young people given high SAVRY summary risk ratings.\nThe SAVRY is a valid and useful method for assessing both short-term and long-term risks of violent and non-violent crime by young people in psychiatric as well as criminal justice settings, adding to a traditional risk-centred assessment approach by also indicating where future preventive treatment efforts should be targeted. The next steps should be to evaluate its role in everyday clinical practice when using the knowledge generated to inform and monitor management and treatment strategies."}, {"Title": "Implementing Adolescent Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) Education in a Pediatric Residency Curriculum.", "Abstract": "Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is recommended as part of routine health care for adolescents as well as adults.

Our project focused on creating scientifically based, developmentally appropriate strategies and teaching materials for the adolescent age range. This paper describes curriculum development and implementation and presents evaluation data.\nPediatric and child psychiatry residents were trained. The training consisted of 4 activities: (1) case-based teaching modules, (2) role-play of motivational interviewing and brief interventions, (3) mock interviews with trained adolescents, and (4) supervised \"hands-on\" screening and brief interventions. Main outcome measures included trainee satisfaction, and SBIRT knowledge, perceived self-efficacy, and self- and observer report of use of the SBIRT algorithm.\nAmong 150 total participants completing the SBIRT training modules, nearly all (92.3%) were satisfied/very satisfied with the training modules. Knowledge accuracy immediately post training was high, but declined significantly by the end of the first residency year, with little change across subsequent years of residency. Confidence ratings also declined over time. Use of the SBIRT algorithm during the Adolescent Medicine rotation was high according to trainee self- and faculty observer report.\nWe found evidence of training satisfaction, increased confidence in talking to adolescents about substance use, and widespread use of recommended practices immediately following training. Use of a highly structured algorithm to guide practice, and simple, highly structured brief interventions was a successful training approach, as residents self-reported accurate use of the SBIRT algorithm immediately after training. Knowledge and self-confidence declined over time.

Main findings concern prevalence rates of demoralization, evidence of discriminant validity from major depression, factors associated with demoralization and evidence of clinical utility. The instruments vary in their definition, the populations they aim to assess, prevalence rates they estimate and their ability to discriminate between different conditions. Nonetheless, demoralization appears to be a distinctive psychological state characterized by helplessness, hopelessness, giving up and subjective incompetence. It is not limited to life-threatening diseases such as cancer, but may occur in any type of clinical situation.

Thirty-five adults with ADHD, who were recruited from the ADHD outpatient clinic at the Department of Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, University of W\u00fcrzburg, and thirty-five matched healthy controls completed the Digit Span test and the Stroop Color Word Test. While there were no main effects of ADHD or COMT, the two factors interacted on both Digit Span subtests with the two groups' met/met carriers showing significantly different performance on the Digit Span Forward subtest and the val/val carriers showing significantly different performance on the Digit Span Backward subtest.

In 2012, the authors distributed the surveys: by paper to 133 US psychiatry department chairs and electronically through the American Psychiatric Association to 3,563 of its members (1,000 psychiatrists and 2,563 trainees).\nThe response rates for the chair, psychiatrist, and trainee surveys were 53, 9, and 18 %, respectively. A large majority of respondents agreed with the need for more neuroscience education in general and with respect to their own training. Most respondents believed that neuroscience will help destigmatize mental illness and begin producing new treatments or personalized medicines in 5-10 years. Only a small proportion of trainees and psychiatrists, however, reported a strong knowledge base in neuroscience. Respondents also reported broad enthusiasm for transdiagnostic topics in neuroscience (such as emotion regulation and attention/cognition) and description at the level of neural circuits.\nThis study demonstrates the opportunity and enthusiasm for teaching more neuroscience in psychiatry among a broad range of stakeholder groups. A high level of interest was also found for transdiagnostic topics and approaches. We suggest that a transdiagnostic framework may be an effective way to deliver neuroscience education to the psychiatric community and illustrate this through a case example, drawing the similarity between this neuroscience approach and problem-based formulations familiar to clinicians."}, {"Title": "Effectiveness of an educational handbook in improving psychiatry resident knowledge of second-generation antipsychotics.", "Abstract": "The authors describe a pilot evaluation of an educational handbook designed to increase resident knowledge of second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) use in the pediatric population, with an emphasis on metabolic monitoring.\nAn educational handbook focusing on SGA use in children and adolescents was introduced to psychiatry residents undergoing a child psychiatry rotation. Baseline and post-intervention questionnaires were administered to determine whether SGA knowledge increased.\nBaseline and post-intervention questionnaires were completed by 32 residents. At baseline, most residents (92.9 %) had interacted with an adult patient requiring an SGA and had prescribed SGAs at least five times (70.9 %) in the previous month. Baseline SGA knowledge was limited such that only 5.4 % of participants scored greater than 80 %, and 28.6 % scored below 60 %. Mean total score improved significantly from pre-test (18.4 \u00b1 4.23) to post-test (21.2 \u00b1 3.28, p = 0.001). Stratified analysis suggested a significant improvement of scores (post-test versus pre-test, respectively) in females (21.8 \u00b1 3.11 versus 18.0 \u00b1 4.94, p = 0.003) and junior residents (21.3 \u00b1 3.34 versus 18.1 \u00b1 4.37, p = 0.001). While significant improvements were documented in questions related to Health Canada-approved and other off-label evidence-based indications, and the appropriate physical examination components and laboratory tests to perform at SGA initiation and follow-up, no improvements were documented regarding the distinguishing properties, side effects, and appropriate history-taking prior to SGA initiation.\nImplementation of an educational handbook can improve resident knowledge related to SGA use in children over the short-term. However, future research should be directed at the effectiveness of more interactive web-based formats in optimizing learning for male residents and ensuring more comprehensive knowledge uptake. While the introduction of an education handbook is the first step in addressing some of the barriers to metabolic monitoring, prospective longitudinal studies are required to determine whether such an intervention will ultimately improve prescriber adherence over the long-term."}, {"Title": "Patients with very-late-onset schizoprhenia-like psychosis have higher mortality rates than elderly patients with earlier onset schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "In this register-based study of schizophrenia patients aged 65 years or above, mortality and causes of death diagnosed at age of 60+ (very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis, VLOSLP) were studied in comparison with sex- and age-matched general Finnish population. Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) of VLOSLP patients were also compared with those of earlier onset (below 60 years) schizophrenia patients, and hazard of death was calculated between these patient groups.\nThe data was obtained from Finnish nationwide registers and consisted of 918 VLOSLP patients and 6142 earlier onset patients who were at least 65 years on 1 January 1999. The register-based follow-up for mortality covered 10 years between 1999 and 2008.\nOverall SMR was 5.02 (4.61-5.46) in the group of VLOSLP patients and 2.93 (2.83-3.03) in the group of earlier onset patients. In men, SMRs were 8.31 (7.14-9.62; n = 179) and 2.91 (2.75-3.07, n = 1316) and in women 4.21 (3.78-4.66; n = 364) and 2.94 (2.82-3.07, n = 2055). In the VLOSLP group, SMRs were higher in most causes-of-death categories such as accidents, respiratory diseases, dementias, neoplasms and circulatory diseases. However, in direct comparison adjusted for several variables, the difference between these groups was minimal (Hazard Ratio, HR, 1.16 95%CI 1.05-1.27, p = 0.003).\nPatients with VLOSLP, especially men, are at even higher risk of death than schizophrenia patients with earlier onset. Physical comorbidities and accidents in the VLOSLP group mostly explained this result.

This paper examines what attracts providers to community psychiatry and what sustains them in their work. Focus groups and interviews were used to elicit the perspectives of prescribing clinicians in three community mental health clinics in the US. Community psychiatry has inherent challenges, including facing high-risk decisions, encountering intense affects, and occasionally witnessing bad outcomes. Psychiatrists are motivated and sustained in this work by (1) cultivating relationships with patients and colleagues, (2) focusing on the mission of promoting recovery, and (3) engaging with clinical practice as intellectually stimulating work. Administrators support the engagement and morale of psychiatrists by creating workflows that allow psychiatrists to meaningfully apply their expertise to support patients' recovery.

The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) were determined for the patient sample and for the general population living in the same area.\nBetween 1 June 2012 and 1 June 2013, 184 patients were seen by ID psychiatry over a total of 553 contacts, with valid SIMD data for 179 patients and 543 contacts. Fifty-two per cent of patients (n = 93) lived in the most deprived SIMD decile, and 90.5% (n = 152) in the lowest 5 deciles.

Subjects' individual Beck Depression Inventory-and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-scores were correlated with clusters showing significant activation during reward anticipation.\nDuring reward anticipation, we observed significant group differences in ventral striatal (VS) activation: patients with schizophrenia, alcohol dependence, and major depression showed significantly less ventral striatal activation compared to healthy controls. Depressive symptoms correlated with dysfunction in reward anticipation regardless of diagnostic entity. There was no significant correlation between anxiety symptoms and VS functional activation.\nOur findings demonstrate a neurobiological dysfunction related to reward prediction that transcended disorder categories and was related to measures of depressed mood. The findings underline the potential of a dimensional approach in psychiatry and strengthen the hypothesis that neurobiological research in psychiatric disorders can be targeted at core mechanisms that are likely to be implicated in a range of clinical entities."}, {"Title": "A prospective study of behavioral and emotional symptoms in preschoolers.", "Abstract": "A substantial number of preschool children exhibit psychological symptoms that have an impact on their own and their families' lives. The aim of the current study was to investigate the prevalence, stability and increase/decrease in emotional and behavioral symptoms and the resultant impairment at two assessment points at preschool age. The sample consisted of 1,034 children drawn from the general population with a mean age of 51\u00a0months at t1 and 72\u00a0months at t2. Parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire extended version (Goodman, J Child Psychol Psychiatry 38(5):581-586, 1997; Goodman, J Child Psychol Psychiatry 40(5):791-799, 1999).

From t1 to t2, emotional symptoms and prosocial behavior significantly increased, while hyperactivity, conduct problems, peer problems and total difficulties decreased. The mean total impact score did not change. Boys showed higher levels of symptoms (except emotional symptoms) and impact, and lower prosocial behavior, than girls. Moreover, there was a significant time\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0gender interaction, with girls showing a larger decrease in hyperactivity/inattention and in total difficulties than boys. The stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the total impact score at baseline, male gender, conduct problems, hyperactivity and peer problems significantly contributed to the explained variance of the total impact score at follow-up.

The so-called loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials is generated by pyramidal cells of the primary auditory cortex (LDAEP) which are modulated by serotonergic projection fibers to the main regulators of pyramidal cells, i.e. GABAergic interneurons. Therefore, there are a lot of preclinical as well as clinical proofs and hints that the LDAEP may serve as a valid indicator of synaptically released serotonin, although there are also data not supporting this relationship. This is further examplified by LDAEP data in patients with different states of schizophrenia, from prodromal to the chronic state. Hereby, a strong relationship was found between LDAEP, i.e. different serotonin levels, and the negative symptoms of these groups of patients with schizophrenia. This underlines the importance of LDAEP as indicator of central serotonergic neurotransmission and its high relevance for clinical psychiatry and psychopharmacology."}, {"Title": "The Role of Cultural Factors in Differentiating Pathological Gamblers.", "Abstract": "It is recognised that cultural factors play a role in the onset and continuation of several mental health problems.

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare groups on QUISE scores of subjective culture. Moreover, a logistic regression was applied in order to esteem the capability of the QUISE scores to differentiate between pathological gamblers and control.

For some treatments, however, there may be disagreement over the requirements for 'informed' consent. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one such example. Blease argues that patients 'should surely be privy to the matters of fact that: (1) there is continued controversy over the effectiveness of ECT; (2) there is orthodox scientific consensus that there is currently no acknowledged explanation for ECT and (3) there is a serious (mainstream) debate over whether the response to ECT may be a placebo response.' Before embracing these suggestions, two key questions must be asked. Are these claims a reasonable representation of current ECT research? And if so, will this information be of benefit to patients? The evidence-based support for ECT from both National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the Royal College of Psychiatrists appears to undermine the validity of claims (1) and (3), and therefore the rationale for providing this information. Concerning assertion (2), it is true that the mechanism by which ECT has its therapeutic effect is not yet established, although the importance of conveying this fact to the patient is questionable. Of greater certainty is that the same irresolution surrounds the mechanism of action of pharmaceutical antidepressants, and so a double standard in patient care should be mindfully avoided if provision of this information is deemed a prerequisite for proper 'informed' consent."}, {"Title": "Karl Stern (1906-1975).", "Abstract": "The forced migration process of German-speaking neurologists and psychiatrists under the Nazis during the 1930s and 40s is often preoccupied solely with \"successful\" concepts and therapeutic approaches.

The case is also rare because of the unique circumstances involving the victim - a local service psychiatrist - and the perpetrator - a former medical specialist in psychiatry, suffering from a delusional psychotic disorder. The crossbow was the decisive instrument in the realization of the murder; it was chosen with premeditation for its high destructive capacity and the fact that it was easily obtainable, and it was used with darts that were specially modified to increase its harmful capacity. The presented case, as well as providing an opportunity to highlight the damaging effects of a rarely used weapon, stresses the problems inherent with access to tools such as the crossbow that are used in sport, and which are potentially dangerous but easily accessible, even to those with serious mental disorders, rendering them legally unfit for using firearms."}, {"Title": "Informal health care practices of residents: \"curbside\" consultation and self-diagnosis and treatment.", "Abstract": "The authors explore the experiences of residents with respect to informal care related to personal health, including \"curbside consultation,\" self-diagnosis, and self-prescription-self-care practices that run counter to ethical guidelines in medicine.\nResidents at one medical school completed a written survey regarding their personal health care practices, including their experiences in seeking or providing informal consultation, self-diagnosis, and self-prescribing.

This condition can result in diagnostic confusion and unrelieved suffering when clinicians interpret the emotional expressions at face value.

Our investigation showed that her symptoms were caused by pseudobulbar affect/emotional incontinence stemming from multiple sclerosis.\nThe patient's history of multiple sclerosis and the fact that she identified herself as depressed only because of her incessant crying suggested that her symptoms might be due to the multiple sclerosis rather than to a depressive disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a new plaque consistent with multiple sclerosis lateral to her corpus callosum. Her symptoms resolved completely within three days on valproic acid but returned after she was cross-tapered to dextromethorphan plus quinidine, which is the FDA-approved treatment for this condition.\nThis case provides important additional information to the current literature on pseudobulbar affect/emotional incontinence. The existing literature suggests a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and dextromethorphan/quinidine (Nuedexta) as first-line treatments; however, our patient was taking an SSRI at the time of presentation without appreciable benefit, and her symptoms responded to valproic acid but not to the dextromethorphan/quinidine.

A self-report questionnaire including 56 dichotomous items was used to compare beliefs about and attitudes towards people with mental illness. Factor analysis was used to identify key attitudes and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare the groups adjusting for age and personal experience with people with mental illness.\nThere were no significant trends in attitudes towards the effectiveness of medication. Exploratory factor analysis of the beliefs and attitudes items identified four factors: (1) comfort socializing with people with mental, illness; (2) non-superstitious beliefs about the causes of mental illness; (3) neighborly feelings towards people with mental illness; and (4) belief that stress and abuse are part of the etiology of mental illness. ANCOVA comparing attitudes among the three groups showed that on three (1, 2, and 4) of the four factors medical students who had completed a rotation in psychiatry had significantly higher scores than the medical students who had not completed a rotation in psychiatry. Graduate physicians showed a similar pattern scoring higher than the medical students who had not completed a rotation in psychiatry in two factors (1 and 4) but showed no differences from students who had completed their psychiatry rotation.\nWhile beliefs about medication effectiveness do not differ between medical trainees and graduate professionals, stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental illness seem to be most strongly affected by clinical training. Psychiatric education and especially clinical experience result in more progressive attitudes towards people with mental illness."}, {"Title": "Developing a mentorship program for psychiatry residents.", "Abstract": "The authors sought to evaluate a formal mentorship program for second-year psychiatry residents at the University of Toronto after the program's first year of implementation.\nTen mentees and ten faculty mentors were interviewed by fellow second-year residents and an independent researcher, respectively, about their experiences in the program. Interview data were thematically coded and analyzed using a grounded theory approach.\nThree major themes were identified. First, participants emphasized the importance of a natural, flexible, and engaging matching process for mentors and mentees. Many experienced the random assignment approach to matching and the mandatory nature of the program as barriers to developing a meaningful relationship with their mentors. Second, participants expressed a preference for geographic proximity between mentor and mentee workplaces and for meetings to take place in informal settings in order to improve the quality and quantity of their interactions. Lastly, participants felt that clear directions and expectations about the program's goals should be communicated, and that a forum for information sharing among mentors was needed.\nOverall, the majority of participants believed that the program facilitated growth and development and provided positive opportunities for both mentors and mentees. While challenges were present in the program, participants provided tangible recommendations to improve the process."}, {"Title": "Etomidate is associated with longer seizure duration, lower stimulus intensity, and lower number of failed trials in electroconvulsive therapy compared with thiopental.", "Abstract": "Induction agents used for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may alter seizure parameters. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of etomidate and thiopental on seizure-related variables.\nRegistries of patients who received ECT between 2010 and 2013 in a tertiary psychiatry clinic were evaluated retrospectively. The information of patients who were on the same induction agent and muscle relaxant during the whole treatment course was assessed. Primary outcome measures were total number of ECT sessions, mean peripheral and central seizure duration, cumulative stimulus intensity, and the number of adequate seizures per total number of stimuli. Secondary measures were maximum systolic-diastolic and mean blood pressure, peak heart rate, and the frequency of antihypertensive drug use during the sessions.\nAlthough the total number of ECT sessions is similar between the etomidate (n = 43) and thiopenthal (n = 31) groups, the mean seizure duration per stimuli was significantly longer whereas the cumulative stimulus intensity was lower in the etomidate group. The number of adequate seizures obtained in relation with the number of stimuli was also significantly higher, indicating increased probability of eliciting an adequate seizure with etomidate. During threshold determination, the number of stimuli needed to provide an adequate seizure was marginally less with etomidate. No group difference was observed in hemodynamic changes and the frequency of antihypertensive use.\nEtomidate use, compared with thiopental as an induction agent, is associated with longer seizure duration with less cumulative intensity. The use of etomidate reduces the number of failed trials and may prevent the application of unnecessary electrical stimuli with a possibly safe hemodynamic profile."}, {"Title": "Prevalence and attributes of criminality in patients with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Existing research in law and psychiatry point to schizophrenia as a risk factor for violence and offense behaviors. The present study aims to: 1) report on the prevalence and types of offensive or criminal acts in patients with schizophrenia; 2) identify attributes of schizophrenic offenders; and 3) examine factors associated with offensive or criminal behaviors within a sample of schizophrenic offenders.\nThis was a cross-sectional study of 358 patients with schizophrenia who were admitted to a psychiatric ward in Iran between 2004 and 2008. Study data was collected using patients' medical, criminal records, as well as via personal interview with the family member. Study variables included criminality or offensive behavior, types of schizophrenia (paranoid vs. nonparanoid), experiencing hallucination, disease onset, and patients' demographics.\nOf the sample, 64.8% were male, 80.7% were 45 years old or younger, and 74.1% were either single or divorced. Slightly over 59 % were offenders with criminal status, of which, 9.8% were legal offenders and 48.6% were hidden offenders. The results of unadjusted logistic regression between these variables and criminality show, except for employment, marital status, and opium use, all other variables were statically associated with criminality.\nMethodological difficulties arising from this study, as well as, the role of mental health professionals, family, and legal system for prevention of violence in and by patients with schizophrenia are discussed."}, {"Title": "Barriers to accessing HIV services for Black African communities in Cambridgeshire, the United Kingdom.", "Abstract": "The majority of new HIV diagnoses in the United Kingdom (UK) occur in people with heterosexually acquired HIV infection, the majority of whom are African communities.

It is unknown whether similar network abnormalities are present in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with a history of affective psychopathology.\n17 TLE patients with a lifetime affective diagnosis, 31 TLE patients with no formal psychiatric history and 30 HVs were included. We used a visuo-spatial 'n-back' paradigm to compare working memory (WM) network activation between these groups. Post hoc analyses included voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging. The Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen and Beck Anxiety Inventory were completed on the day of scanning.\nEach group activated the fronto-parietal WM networks and deactivated the typical DMN in response to increasing task demands. Group comparison revealed that TLE patients with lifetime affective morbidity showed significantly greater deactivation in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC) than either the TLE-only or the HVs (p<0.001). This effect persisted after covarying for current psychotropic medication and severity of current depressive/anxiety symptoms (all p<0.001). Correlational analysis revealed that this finding was not driven by differences in task performance. There were no significant differences in grey matter volume or structural connectivity between the TLE groups.\nOur results provide novel evidence suggesting that affective psychopathology in TLE has a neurobiological correlate, and in this context the sACC performs differently compared with network activity in primary affective disorders."}, {"Title": "'We didn't have a clue': Family caregivers' experiences of the communication of a diagnosis of schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Despite widespread acceptance of the principle that patients should be informed about their diagnosis, many clinicians are reluctant to provide a diagnosis of schizophrenia. This study examines family caregivers' experiences of the communication of a schizophrenia diagnosis and related information.\nA generic qualitative methodological approach was used. In all, 13 family caregivers were recruited in regional New South Wales, Australia. Semi-structured interviews were used to explore their experiences and perceptions of discussing the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of schizophrenia with mental health professionals. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, codes generated and thematic analysis undertaken.\nFamily caregivers described long and difficult pathways to being given a diagnosis, haphazard means of finding out the diagnosis, high unmet needs for information, exclusion from the medical care process and problematic communication and general interactions with mental health clinicians. Caregivers were unanimous about the importance of receiving a timely diagnosis, for them and their relative with schizophrenia.\nFamily caregivers are an integral part of the mental health-care system, and they should be included early in discussions of diagnosis and treatment of a person with schizophrenia. Their perspectives on communicating a diagnosis of schizophrenia provide important information for communication skills training of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals."}, {"Title": "[Karl Jaspers and the challenges of social psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Karl Jaspers, in his book \"General Psychopathology\", argued for methodological pluralism rather than theoretical dogmatism. He formulated a methodological order of psychopathology with a distinction between \"explanation\" (objective psychopathology) and \"understanding\" (subjective psychopathology, psychopathology of meaning). The latter approach focused on patients' subjective experience and biographical issues. Karl Jaspers emphasised social factors in the genesis and course of mental disorders. Following a multiperspective concept, from Jaspers' viewpoint social psychiatry should consider itself of equal importance with biological and psychotherapeutic psychiatry. Therefore, uncritical generalization of one of these perspectives should be avoided. Personalized psychiatry, apart from searching biological markers to tailor treatment should identify psychosocial factors and subjective meaning. Concepts of recovery should not ignore biological foundations in mental disorders."}, {"Title": "[Predicting the Number of Office-Based Psychiatrists Needed in the Future: Potential and Limitations].", "Abstract": "This study discusses the potential and the limitations of medical workforce planning in outpatient psychiatry in Switzerland.\nHypotheses concerning selected factors influencing the number of office-based psychiatrists needed in the future were formulated.

These signs are observed in the case of diseases supporting the neurodevelopmental model such as schizophrenia in general and its early form defined notably by an age of onset of less than 18 years. Indeed, the NSS belong to a set of clinical, cognitive, electrophysiological and neuroanatomical markers reflecting neurodevelopmental brain abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia.\nThe objectives of our study were to determine the prevalence, the scores, and the nature of neurological soft signs (NSS) in adolescent patients suffering from early onset schizophrenia diagnosis in comparison to healthy controls, and to explore the correlations between NSS and the demographic, clinical and therapeutic features of these patients.\nTwelve adolescents were recruited in the Child Psychiatry Department at the Razi Hospital (Tunisia), with the diagnosis of schizophrenia according to the DSM-IV supplemented by the Kiddie SAD PL. They were matched by age and educational level with twelve healthy controls without psychiatric family or personal history. The clinical status of the patients was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Neurological soft signs (NSS) were rated with the Neurological Soft Signs Examination (NSSE) by Krebs et al. (2000) for the two groups. This scale is composed of 23 items exploring motor coordination, motor integrative function, sensory integration, involuntary movements and quality of lateralization.\nThe mean age of our population was 14.7 years. The average age of onset of the disease was 12.2 years. The sex-ratio was 1.4. Educational level was 7.4 years. The PANSS mean total score was 74.3. The mean daily dose, in chlorpromazine equivalents, was 523.9 mg/day. Four patients received a strict monotherapy of antipsychotics, while the other patients were receiving an association of two neuroleptics. The prevalence of NSS was 100% (cut-off point=11) with a mean total score of 29.3\u00b14.1. The highest score was for the motor coordination (10.1). As for the control group, the mean total score was 7\u00b11.3. A highly significant difference was found between patients and controls for all sub-scores of NSS. Negative correlations were found in patients, between age and neurological soft signs total score (P=0.05; r=-0.57) and also with sensory integration score (P=0.04; r=-0.58). The NSS total score was also correlated with low educational level (P=0.03; r=-0.61). There was no correlation between neurological soft signs scores and PANSS scores or the daily dose of antipsychotics.\nThe prevalence and NSS scores are high among young people with early onset schizophrenia diagnosis illustrating the existence of structural abnormalities of the brain, themselves consequences of early neurodevelopmental disturbances, which would support the neurodevelopmental hypothesis concerning this pathology."}, {"Title": "The SATISPSY-22: development and validation of a French hospitalized patients' satisfaction questionnaire in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The aim of our study was to develop a specific French self-administered instrument for measuring hospitalized patients' satisfaction in psychiatry based on exclusive patient point of view: the SATISPSY-22.\nThe development of the SATISPSY was undertaken in three steps: item generation, item reduction, and validation. The content of the SATISPSY was derived from 80 interviews with patients hospitalized in psychiatry. Using item response and classical test theories, item reduction was performed in 2 hospitals on 270 responders. The validation was based on construct validity, reliability, and some aspects of external validity.\nThe SATISPSY contains 22 items describing 6 dimensions (staff, quality of care, personal experience, information, activity, and food). The six-factor structure accounted for 78.0% of the total variance. Each item achieved the 0.40 standard for item-internal consistency, and the Cronbach's alpha coefficients were>0.70. Scores of dimensions were strongly positively correlated with Visual Analogue Scale scores.

Several studies have already found correlations between trait-impulsivity and externalizing disorders. However, the studies interested in the relationship between trait-impulsivity and internalizing problems are rare. We have tried to explore correlations between impulsivity and externalization and internalization problems, in a population of adolescent outpatients.\nWe recruited 31 adolescent out-patients in the child and adolescent psychiatry department in the University Hospital of Monastir, Tunisia. The Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS) was used to evaluate a multidimensional concept of trait-impulsivity, including the dimensions of \"Motor\", \"Non-planning\" and \"Attentional\" impulsivities. The Strength and Difficulties Scales (SDQ) was used to assess different domains of externalizing and internalizing problems, including \"Emotional symptoms\", \"Conduct problems\", \"Hyperactivity\" and \"Peer problems\".\nThe sex-ratio was 1.21. The mean age was 15.19\u00b11.27 years. All patients but one were attending school. The diagnosis was \"Major Depressive Episode\" in 32% and \"Behavior Disorder\" in 38%. The means of the scores of externalizing and internalizing problems were 9.35\u00b14.41 and 9.65\u00b13.26, respectively. The total score of the BIS was significantly related to both scores of externalizing and internalizing problems. The \"Motor\" impulsivity was specially correlated with the externalizing dimension of the SDQ. The non-planning impulsivity was correlated with both scores of externalizing and internalizing problems, but it was mainly related to internalizing problems. The attentional impulsivity was also correlated with both dimensions of externalizing and internalizing problems.\nThe dimensions of trait-impulsivity were correlated with various dimensions of the SDQ concerning externalizing and internalizing problems. That confirms the hypothesis that the impulsiveness is associated with wide domains of the psychopathology of the teenager which are not limited to behavior disorders. We can process these problems by influencing the \"Motor impulsivity\" and \"Non-planning impulsivity\".

The performances of functional magnetic resonance imaging are not limited to medical research and are used in non-medical fields. These recent applications represent new challenges for bioethics.\nIn this article we aim at discussing the new ethical issues raised by the applications of the latest neuroimaging technologies to non-medical fields.\nWe included a selection of peer-reviewed English medical articles after a search on NCBI Pubmed database and Google scholar from 2000 to 2013. We screened bibliographical tables for supplementary references. Websites of governmental French institutions implicated in ethical questions were also screened for governmental reports.\nFindings of brain areas supporting emotional responses and regulation have been used for marketing research, also called neuromarketing. The discovery of different brain activation patterns in antisocial disorder has led to changes in forensic psychiatry with the use of imaging techniques with unproven validity. Automated classification algorithms and multivariate statistical analyses of brain images have been applied to brain-reading techniques, aiming at predicting unconscious neural processes in humans. We finally report the current position of the French legislation recently revised and discuss the technical limits of such techniques.\nIn the near future, brain imaging could find clinical applications in psychiatry as diagnostic or predictive tools. However, the latest advances in brain imaging are also used in non-scientific fields raising key ethical questions. Involvement of neuroscientists, psychiatrists, physicians but also of citizens in neuroethics discussions is crucial to challenge the risk of unregulated uses of brain imaging."}, {"Title": "One-year test-retest reliability of a Japanese web-based version of the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) for major depression in a working population.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the one-year test-retest reliability and the demographic correlates of a self-administered web-based depression section of the World Health Organization-Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI) in a working population. Overall, 1060 out of all employees (N\u2009=\u20091279) from a manufacturing company in Japan responded to two web-based surveys of depression of the WHO-CIDI within a one-year interval in 2009 and 2010. The concordance between lifetime diagnoses of major depressive disorder on two occasions was calculated as percent agreement (%), Gwet's AC1 , and Yule's Q indicators were compared by gender, age, education, and marital status. For the total sample, percent agreement was 94%, AC1 was 0.93, and Yule's Q was 0.82. The concordance rate was low (0.15) among those who were diagnosed at either time or both times. The concordance differed significantly across education and marital status. While the agreement indicators were relatively high, consistent with previous reports based on face-to-face interviews conducted within a shorter interval, the low stability of positive cases may challenge the accuracy of lifetime diagnosis of major depressive disorder using a web version of the WHO-CIDI.

Development and initial experiences].", "Abstract": "Standardization in psychiatry is a developmental process which, following on from psychopathology and nosology is now increasingly affecting the field of treatment. The development of guidelines for the treatment of psychiatric diseases has now become well accepted, although the impact on routine practice is still limited. Treatment pathways bring recommendations from guidelines into a clear and practice-oriented algorithm. The prerequisite for this is the inclusion of all aspects and elements of the treatment as well as all professions involved in the treatment and a valid electronic data processing foundation. Such an approach is presented here with the example of the development and implementation of a clinical pathway for inpatients with schizophrenia. Initial results revealed that patients who received multi-professional treatment within such a clinical pathway, improved better than patients of the control group, as measured by CGI, PANSS and PSP. This shows that introduction of a clinical pathway leads to an improvement of treatment quality. Standardization of psychiatric treatment processes could be highly relevant in respect to the new remuneration system for psychiatry in Germany."}, {"Title": "Knowledge and confidence of the Mental Health Act in Scotland: a survey of general practitioners.", "Abstract": "Front-line clinician general practitioners may be required to assist in the administration of mental health legislation.

A favourable social climate can contribute to a reduction in aggression. The aim of this study was to examine the perceptions of clinical staff about the social climate of acute old age psychiatry inpatient units. Eighty-five clinicians were recruited from these facilities. They completed a survey questionnaire about the social climate or ward atmosphere of inpatient units. The findings showed that, to some extent, respondents' perceived patient cohesion and mutual support were evident, units were perceived somewhat positively as safe environments for patients and staff, and the ward climate helped meet patients' therapeutic needs. Overall, clinicians were somewhat positive about the social climate of the units, and this has implications for the perception of aggression in old age psychiatry inpatient settings. As there is a direct relationship between social climate and aggression, clinicians should consider adopting a broad-based, person-centred approach to the promotion of a favourable social climate in old age psychiatry inpatient settings."}, {"Title": "Community treatment orders: implications of the drafting of the Mental Health Act 2007 for emergency detention of community patients.", "Abstract": "Since the introduction of Community Treatment Orders by the Mental Health Act 2007, their use has increased year on year.

Part I: In search of Wernicke's pseudodementia].", "Abstract": "The authors explore the history of pseudodementia in the elderly; an issue with growing momentum in a world where life duration expectancy has been constantly growing and the management and treatments of dementias has imposed an equally increasing burden. Although the issue is mainly therapeutic, some of the main tenets of the current approaches rest heavily on historical issues. The invention of the term pseudodementia (Pseudodemenz) is usually credited to Wernicke. However, the exact circumstances and the debates that have accompanied the emergence of the term have never been fully uncovered, and the references are not accurate. Most of the recent literature cites Kiloh as the key influence in structuring the current uses of the term, but the relationship between both sources is not clear.\nA research of anteriority has been conducted on the basis of Medline via Pubmed, PsychINFO and google book, using the following keywords: pseudodementia, pseudodementia, depressive pseudodementia, pseudod\u00e9mence, Pseudodemenz. We have researched the quotations to localize the origin of the concept. Complementarily, we have attempted to clarify the nature of the debates by exploring the relevant German psychiatric literature at the end of the XIXth century and the beginning of the XXth.\nWe have found that the very first occurrences of the notion appeared in a debate between the following authors: Ganser S.J.M. 1898, 1903; Wernicke C. 1898; Raecke J. 1901; Nissl F. 1902; Jung C.G. 1902, 1903; Stertz G. 1910; Bonhoeffer K. 1911; Schuppius S. 1914. We found that the term Pseudodemenz never appears in Wernicke's written works, although he was credited of its invention by his most direct students. It seems that the term was thought by the time it emerged to have originated in Wernicke's discussion of Ganser's syndrome.\nGanser's syndrome, often defined as carceral psychosis, is a specific hysterical twilight state characterized by \"talking past the point\" (Vorbeireden), amnesia and hysterical stigmas, in which some trauma was thought to be causative. Wernicke presented it as determined by a \"restriction of the field of consciousness\", echoing Janet's theory (\u00c9cole de la Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re). He rejected the twilight characteristic: this differential point seems to have initiated the introduction of the concept of pseudodementia. Raecke argued that such states should not be understood as forms of simulation thus contributing to a heated debate of the time. Referring to Janet's works and expanding the syndrome of \"traumatic hysteria\", he argued in favor of a specific inhibiting factor which disturbs the process of associations. Jung, refusing Nissl's article dismissing Ganser, Wernicke and Raecke's views, confirmed the hysterical hypothesis. In a new contribution to the debate, Ganser contested Wernicke's differential point, arguing that in Vorbeireden, there was a Benommenheit - some sort of giddiness - and a \"superficiality of the contents of consciousness\" rather than a limitation of consciousness. It has been rightly argued that Wernicke's view of the pseudodementia issues was mainly related to the debates on hysteria and trauma, and that no relationship with old age symptomatology was established by him. However, we have found that he alluded to at least one case in which such a relationship was hypothesized. Moreover, one should note that Wernicke's views on hysteria included the rather pervasive notion of \"hysterical psychosis\", exhibiting \"allopsychosis\", which could include what would nowadays be seen as schizophrenia or psychotic mood disorders.\nFirst of all, the term Pseudodemenz, if it was ever used by Wernicke verbally, never appears in his published works. Besides, the debates concerning Ganser's syndrome, which served as a first paradigm to discuss pseudodementia, were highly influenced by the discussions on traumatic disorders, hysteria and simulation. Finally, although no direct connection is made between disorders of the senium and Pseudodemenz, the fact that Wernicke included both in what he termed \"allopsychic disorders\" seemed to indicate that some kind of relationship could not be absolutely excluded in Wernicke's mind."}, {"Title": "Treatment and Control: A Qualitative Study of Older Mentally Ill Offenders' Perceptions on Their Detention and Care Trajectory.", "Abstract": "The life of older mentally ill offenders (OMIOs) is often characterized by successive periods of detention in correctional facilities, admissions to psychiatric services, and unsuccessful attempts to live independently. Through in-depth interviews, eight personal stories from OMIOs under supervision of the commission of social defence in Ghent (Belgium) were analyzed in the phenomenological research tradition. The results of the study reveal that OMIOs had more positive and less negative experiences in prison settings when compared with other institutional care settings. Independent living, unsurprisingly, is favored the most. This may be due to the fact that the latter option fosters personal competence, feelings of being useful, personal choices, and contact with the \"outside\" world. Even in later lifetime, a combined approach of risk assessment with improvement of well-being remains valuable to stimulate offender rehabilitation. Therefore, more research into concepts that could be used to support OMIOs needs further consideration."}, {"Title": "Specific risk factors of arsonists in a forensic psychiatric hospital.", "Abstract": "Arsonists are often treated in forensic settings.

Kagwa, East african psychiatry, and the Gisu.", "Abstract": "In the early 1960s, medical officers and administrators began to receive reports of what was being described as \"mass madness\" and \"mass hysteria\" in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) and Uganda. Each epidemic reportedly affected between three hundred and six hundred people and, coming in the wake of independence from colonial rule, caused considerable concern. One of the practitioners sent to investigate was Benjamin H. Kagwa, a Ugandan-born psychiatrist whose report represents the first investigation by an African psychiatrist in East Africa. This article uses Kagwa's investigation to explore some of the difficulties facing East Africa's first generation of psychiatrists as they took over responsibility for psychiatry. During this period, psychiatrists worked in an intellectual climate that was both attempting to deal with the legacy of colonial racism, and which placed faith in African psychiatrists to reveal more culturally sensitive insights into African psychopathology. The epidemics were the first major challenge for psychiatrists such as Kagwa precisely because they appeared to confirm what colonial psychiatrists had been warning for years-that westernization would eventually result in mass mental instability. As this article argues, however, Kagwa was never fully able to free himself from the practices and assumptions that had pervaded his discipline under colonial rule. His analysis of the epidemics as a \"mental conflict\" fit into a much longer tradition of psychiatry in East Africa, and stood starkly against the explanations of the local community."}, {"Title": "Variability of patient safety culture in Belgian acute hospitals.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to measure differences in safety culture perceptions within Belgian acute hospitals and to examine variability based on language, work area, staff position, and work experience.\nThe Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture was distributed to hospitals participating in the national quality and safety program (2007-2009).

Family members had a significant impact on the decision to seek MHC.\nStudies of pathways to MHC in Asian countries are feasible and can provide data of interest in the organization of care."}]
