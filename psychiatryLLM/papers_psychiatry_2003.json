However, in this paper, additional reasons are advanced to explain the growth of forensic psychiatry, such as an expansion in the types of \"psychiatric defences\" in courts of law; public concerns about violent behaviour attributed to the mentally ill; the community management of paraphilias, especially pedophilia; the development of risk assessment methodologies and the halo of super-specialization. The net result of these developments is that patients who receive a label of \"forensic\" enter into a mental health ghetto with little connectivity or integration with the general mental health system. The forensic label increases the stigma and decreases opportunities for reintegration and full social recovery. The paper provides guidelines to reverse these trends."}, {"Title": "Symptom dimensions and outcome in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Since Kraepelin, outcome has been one of the most frequently used criteria for testing the validity of diagnosis in psychiatry. Factor analytic methods have showed, however, that the symptomatology of psychiatric patients can be divided into symptom dimensions, which also correlate with outcome. The aim of the present study was to explore how diagnostic sub-categories and symptom dimensions correlate with outcome in first-episode and chronic patients with schizophrenia. In samples of first-episode schizophrenia patients (n=156) and chronic schizophrenia patients (n=1571), symptom variables were factored and the five symptom dimensions obtained were correlated with outcome variables. In both samples, symptom dimensions were more powerful in explaining variance of outcome than categorical sub-diagnoses. Thus, a dimensional approach seems to be valuable not only in describing the illness picture, but also in predicting outcome in schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry and primary care.", "Abstract": "There is now almost universal recognition that primary care is the place where most mentally distressed people first present for help. However, the pace at which the health system has adapted to this reality varies greatly from country to country, depending on the amount of resource devoted to mental illness services, the way in which primary care physicians have organized their practice, and the inertia of the system. Here we present several models from developed and developing countries and address briefly the issue of training of health workers."}, {"Title": "Rethinking mental health: a European WHO perspective.", "Abstract": "In spite of recent clinical and research advances, an increased burden of mortality and morbidity related to stress and mental ill health can be noted, especially in European societies and populations undergoing stressful transitions and dramatic changes. A societal syndrome, consisting of depression, suicide, abuse, risk-taking and violent behaviour as well as vascular morbidity and mortality, can be observed, reflecting individual psychopathology related to disturbances of the serotonin metabolism as one of the oldest, most basic cerebral instruments of mankind to survive, to socialize, to cope with stress and danger. In a time where mental health professionals look for new and challenging identities, they have a tendency to abdicate from social psychiatric and public health activities in favour of more prestigious positions in brain research, genetics or advanced psychotherapy. A redefinition, reconceptualization and renaissance of social psychiatry seems timely and necessary, responding to the burden, advances and possibilities related to mental health we find today. It should proceed from the reductionism which often has characterized earlier psychosocial and social psychiatric approaches, utilize modern knowledge about neuroplasticity, psychoimmunology, neuropsychology and neurophilosophy, reflect the interaction between environment and structure, nature and nurture, and integrate different areas of knowledge in a holistic public mental health approach. Political decisions and societal solutions can be more or less in line with basic human preconditions. Consequences of failure to respect this already can be seen. A new awareness and responsibility-taking with regard to basic human ethological, physiological, psychological and existential conditions is needed and has to be concretized in innovative public mental health approaches."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry and the general hospital in an age of uncertainty.", "Abstract": "General hospitals have had an illustrious role in the evolution of psychiatry. They have provided a rich soil for the growth of inpatient psychiatric units, consultation-liaison psychiatry, psychosomatic medicine, med-psych units, outpatient psychiatric clinics, emergency services and a whole spectrum of resources for the communities in which they dwell. In some respects, whether attached to universities or not, they have functioned as small colleges for the education and training of scores of health professionals. In the setting of the general hospital, psychiatry has had opportunities to become remedicalized and integrated into the mainstream of medicine. However, recent trends in health care run the risk of jeopardizing these accomplishments. Managed care has had a profound impact on the way psychiatry is practiced, taught, and reimbursed. Concerns about cost-containment have raised questions about whether the general hospital will remain the best and most economical setting for psychiatric services. If the primacy of the patient is lost, psychiatry's role in the general hospital will be uncertain. The need to safeguard psychiatry's achievements must be a worldwide endeavor."}, {"Title": "Psychoanalysis today.", "Abstract": "The paper discusses the precarious position of psychoanalysis, a therapeutic approach which historically has defined itself by freedom from constraint and counted treatment length not in terms of number of sessions but in terms of years, in today's era of empirically validated treatments and brief structured interventions. The evidence that exists for the effectiveness of psychoanalysis as a treatment for psychological disorder is reviewed. The evidence base is significant and growing, but less than might meet criteria for an empirically based therapy. The author goes on to argue that the absence of evidence may be symptomatic of the epistemic difficulties that psychoanalysis faces in the context of 21st century psychiatry, and examines some of the philosophical problems faced by psychoanalysis as a model of the mind. Finally some changes necessary in order to ensure a future for psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic therapies within psychiatry are suggested."}, {"Title": "Drug related admissions to intensive care: the role of illicit drugs and self poisoning.", "Abstract": "Drug related problems are a major consumer of healthcare, although little is known about the impact of self-poisoning and illicit drug use on the provision of intensive care. We wished to quantify the number of admissions to our intensive care unit that were attributable to self-poisoning and illicit drug use, and to identify issues related to recognition, follow-up, prevention and cost.\nA retrospective review of all admissions to Liverpool hospital intensive care unit for the year 2000. All admissions with non-alcohol drug-related causes or associations were reviewed and data relating to demographics, reason for admission, drugs taken, length of intensive care unit stay, interventions by Drug and Alcohol and Psychiatry services, follow-up and outcome were obtained.\nOf the 1790 patients admitted to the intensive care unit during the study period, 108 (6%) were non-alcohol drug-related. These admissions accounted for 407 intensive care unit bed days (5% of total intensive care unit bed days) and approximated to 10% of the intensive care unit budget for the year 2000. The majority of patients were male (66%), with a mean age of 33 years. Drug overdose was the most common reason for admission (80%), followed by drug related traumatic injury (16%). The most common drug classes involved were the benzodiazepines, followed by the opiates and tricyclic antidepressants. The majority of patients (65%) had used more than one drug. Thirty-two patients (30%) did not return to their previous functioning level by the time of their discharge from hospital, and 13 of these (12% overall) required full-time nursing care. There were two deaths (2%) as a direct result of illicit drug use or self-poisoning. The hospital Drug and Alcohol or Psychiatry services reviewed 78 patients (72%) as inpatients, and 3 patients (3%) after discharge. Self-discharge or patient refusal to be reviewed by these services occurred in 13 (12%) cases. Twelve patients (11%) were not assessed by these services and were either reviewed by the admitting team or returned to the care of their family practitioner.\nDrug related problems account for a significant number of preventable admissions to intensive care unit every year.

Recent research on treatment interventions for adult patients with chronic depressions suggests that standard treatments for depressive illness may need modification to benefit patients with chronic illness. Little attention at this point has been given to the problem of chronic depression in children and adolescents. Many adults with chronic depressive disorders had onset of depression in their childhood or adolescence, making early identification of this form of illness a priority.

A widespread practice reaching far back in history, abortion is again in the news. Psychiatry sits at the intersection of the religious, ethical, psychological, sociological, medical, and legal facets of the abortion issue. Although the religions that forbid abortion are more prominent in the media, many religions have more liberal approaches. While the basic right to abortion has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, several limitations have been permitted, including parental notification or consent (with the possibility of judicial bypass) for minors, waiting periods, and mandatory provision of certain, sometimes biased, information. Before the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion in 1973, many women were maimed or killed by illegal abortions, and psychiatrists were sometimes asked to certify that abortions were justified on psychiatric grounds. Currently, there are active attempts to convince the public and women considering abortion that abortion frequently has negative psychiatric consequences. This assertion is not borne out by the literature: the vast majority of women tolerate abortion without psychiatric sequelae. The psychiatric outcome of abortion is best when patients are able to make autonomous, supported decisions. Psychiatrists need to know the medical and psychiatric facts about abortion. Psychiatrists can then help patients prevent unwanted pregnancies, make informed decisions consonant with their own values and circumstances when they become pregnant, and find appropriate social and medical resources whatever their decisions may be."}, {"Title": "The controversy over \"chemical restraint\" in acute care psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In many healthcare settings, medications are considered a less invasive alternative to the use of physical restraint for agitated patients experiencing a behavioral crisis, a practice that is often referred to as \"chemical restraint.\" However, recent federal regulations appear to equate chemical and physical restraint and to characterize both as extraordinary practices that should not be undertaken lightly. Although many clinicians consider the term \"chemical restraint\" pejorative, since it does not reflect the possibility that forced medication may be clinically necessary and have a beneficial effect, the term is embedded in recent regulatory language. The author first reviews the controversy over the concept of chemical restraint as it has developed in the mental health literature and regulatory policy. As yet there is no consensus among clinicians or policy makers whether such use of medications is a form of coercion or a form of patient-focused intensive care. The author then discusses precipitants of emergency care and clinical factors and situations that may lead to the use of medications in a way that might be considered chemical restraint. Such factors include clinical and demographic characteristics of patients, institutional characteristics, and staff perception and attitudes. In the final section of the article, the author reviews the recommendations concerning the emergency use of medications given in the Expert Consensus Guidelines on the Treatment of Behavioral Emergencies and discusses treatment developments that have occurred since the time of the survey on which those guidelines were based."}, {"Title": "What do consumers say they want and need during a psychiatric emergency?", "Abstract": "Behavioral emergencies are a common and serious problem for consumers, their families and communities, and the healthcare providers on whom they rely for help. In recent years, serious concerns about the management of behavioral and psychiatric emergencies-in particular, the misapplication and overuse of physical and chemical restraints and seclusion-have become a focus of attention for mental health professionals and policy makers as well as for the lay public, the media, and patient advocacy organizations. Policy leaders and clinicians are searching for ways to balance the rights of consumers with considerations of safety and good care in an area in which it is difficult to conduct research. A survey of mental health professionals who are experts on the treatment of psychiatric and behavioral emergencies identified consumer input and collaboration between patient and clinician whenever possible as being extremely important in achieving the best short-term and particularly the best long-term outcomes for patients. The survey of consumer perspectives described in this article was undertaken in response to the need to better understand consumer experiences and preferences. The authors describe four emergency services forums conducted in 2002, which involved a total of 59 consumers. Each forum involved a written consumer survey as well as a workshop to develop and prioritize recommendations for improving psychiatric emergency care. The authors present the results of the consumer survey and summarize the top recommendations from the workshops. In both the survey and the workshops, the consumers repeatedly stressed the importance of having staff treat them with respect, talk to them, listen to them, and involve them in treatment decisions. There were a number of important areas of agreement between the recommendations of the consumer panel and those of the experts in emergency psychiatry surveyed for the Expert Consensus Guidelines on the Treatment of Behavioral Emergencies. These include the desirability of verbal interventions, the use of a collaborative approach, and the use of oral medications guided by the individual consumer's problems, medication experiences, and preferences. The majority of the consumer panel reported adverse experiences with general hospital emergency rooms and, in fact, called for the development of specialized psychiatric emergency services such as those recommended in the Expert Consensus Guidelines. One-fifth of the consumer panel attributed their emergency contact to lack of access to more routine mental health care. The consumers clearly do not reject medications categorically. Almost half indicated that they wanted medications and a similar number indicated benefit from medications, although many complained of forced administration and unwanted side effects. The consumer panel preferred benzodiazepines and ranked haloperidol as a least preferred option. Among their key recommendations for improving psychiatric emergency care, the consumer panel stressed the development of alternatives to traditional emergency room services, the increased use of advance directives, more comfortable physical environments for waiting and treatment, increased use of peer support services, improved training of emergency staff to foster a more humanistic and person-centered approach, increased collaboration between practitioners and patients, and improved discharge planning and post-discharge follow-up. The implications of these findings for improving psychiatric emergency care are considered."}, {"Title": "[Ethics, culture and psychiatry: the ethics of Mediterranean Europe].", "Abstract": "The defence of the rights of the person, in Mediterranean ethics, is based on a synthesis of civic humanism and liberalism, derived from the spirit of Greek democracy and Enlightenment, and including the achievements of the XIX and XX centuries.

The prevalence of economic values and \"econometric process\" increasingly penetrates the organization of government, institutions and science, as well as favouring uniformity and fragmentation of its constructs and treatments. In regards to the clinical field, theories on treatment of symptoms without consideration of human or social subjectivity as well as organistic and mecanistic theories of the psychic troubles have gained in importance.

The first perspective is oriented towards the control of the violent behavior, the second, guided by a better understanding of the experience of the actors involved in the violent behavior. The third perspective proposed by the authors is directed towards the integration of the trauma as an experience and takes into account the various dimensions of the cycle of violence to which the measures of control contribute.

In recent years, QOL has become increasingly popular as a useful variable tailored to assess the overall impact of diseases and medical treatments from the patient's point of view. In this updating paper, we describe the most frequently used instruments, and discuss the conceptual and practical issues concerning QOL evaluation, as applied to the study of mental disorders. In addition, we present a unifying definition of QOL that has recently been developed by the World Health Organization. Finally, we conclude that QOL measures are potentially useful methods to be applied to research and clinical practice in psychiatry -- especially when used to demonstrate the impact of mental illnesses and the possible benefits of therapeutic interventions."}, {"Title": "[The practice of forensic psychiatry in England and Brazil: a brief comparison].", "Abstract": "The authors make a comparative analysis between the practice of forensic psychiatry in England and in Brazil. The purpose is to stimulate the debate about the conduction of this psychiatric specialization in both countries. It is a study specifically addressed to the criminal area and its approach is carried out based on the legal, clinical, and ethical points of view. The observations made in England may be also applied to Wales, but not to the United Kingdom as a whole, since different legislation is adopted in Scotland and Northern Ireland. It concludes that while in Brazil there is a need for a closer and more integrated relationship between Psychiatry and Law, it is equally significant to clearly define the scope and the boundaries of each of these areas, as ignoring the boundaries between the two specialties could result in the risk of their relationship becoming confused, as appears to be the case in the English context."}, {"Title": "The pharmacovigilance of psychoactive medications in Brazil.", "Abstract": "The present study aimed to analyze 219 notifications of suspected adverse reactions (AR) produced by psychoactive medicaments (ARPM), notified by Brazilian psychiatrists, during a 3-month period (April 1999 up to September 2001).\nA notifying card for adverse reactions possibly produced by psychoactive medications was quarterly sent to all psychiatrists affiliated to the Brazilian Association of Psychiatry.

Algorythms are used to decontextualize complaints of distress and classify them into distinct categories of \"disorders\" based on the presence or absence of specific \"symptoms.\" This is usually followed by the prescription of psychotropic drugs. Such a reductionistic perspective and its mechanical approach to diagnosis and treatment have far reaching epistemological and moral consequences. In this article I address the moral issue from the postmodern ethic articulated by philosopher and theologian John Caputo, which he calls a \"poetics of obligation.\" This position argues for the restoration of respect for the singularity, uniqueness and complexity of each doctor-patient encounter.

His main argument is that the same psychiatrist should treat an individual patient whatever the settings (hospital, community) that the patient shifts through, and that the psychiatrist is the key treating professional and as such should manage and direct care over the continuum. While continuity of psychiatric care is desirable and indeed noncontroversial and feasible, psychiatric services are not central to the care continuum, and its psychiatric control will lead to even more biomedical orientation in patient care. This would undermine another key aspect of Lehrman's vision: a mental health system focused upon the whole person in interaction with the environment. The history of psychiatry shows that, as a medical specialty, psychiatry will inevitably focus upon the brain rather than the person. Psychiatric care could serve as adjunct to appropriate supports, services, and treatment, but if it determines them, they will merely become a downplayed accessory of biomedical (i.e., psychotropic drug) treatment."}, {"Title": "Non-synaptic interaction between neurons in the brain, an analog system: far from Cajal-Sherringtons's galaxy.", "Abstract": "The functional interactions between neurons without synaptic contacts are specialized to function on a time scale of seconds (minutes) and a distance scale of hundreds of micrometers. These nonsynaptic receptors and transporters are of high affinity, have many implications for psychiatry for understanding e.g. depression, changes in mood, in appetite, affective illnesses etc. It is, therefore, suggested that many drugs applied in psychiatric diseases, exert their effects after diffusion through extracellular spaces and may mimic the mode, or may influence the effect of endogenous ligands. The nonsynaptic chemical communication between neurons, and between neurones and target cells, via both pre- and postsynaptic sites, seems likely to achieve growing recognition. This system has a similar degree of selectivity to that of synaptic circuitry but have, in addition, a domain of versatility and plasticity in \"hardwired\" circuitry. The brain is a wired instrument, but its neurons, besides cabled information processing (through synapses), are able to talk to each other without synaptic contact. It is suggested, therefore that the nonsynaptic tonic presynaptic modulation of chemical transmission, plays a physiological role in the brain in shaping emotion, behaviour or learning processes, or in controlling the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, or the nonsynaptic released transmitter is able to produce responses of the target cells and a local fine tuning of cytokine production (cf. Elenkov et al., 2000), steroid secretion and possible many other functions not yet discovered. The spatial and temporal effect of transmitters on nonsynaptic receptors located on axon terminals, adopts the strength of transmission to a given situation. This will not only influence the function of the neurons system in health and disease, but also therapeutic and untoward effects of drugs that bind these nonsynaptic receptors and transporters (Vizi, 2000)."}, {"Title": "QTc Prolongation and the Use of Antipsychotics: A Case Discussion.", "Abstract": "LESSONS LEARNED AT THE INTERFACE OF MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY: The Psychiatric Consultation Service at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) sees medical and surgical inpatients with comorbid psychiatric symptoms and conditions.

Half of these disorders go undiagnosed by the trauma team, resulting in adverse public health and economic consequences. METHOD: In a 16-week pilot study in the emergency department of an inner-city tertiary care hospital, a psychiatrist was integrated into the trauma surgery team by responding to all traumas and rounding with the staff 1 shift per week (March 1, 2000, through June 31, 2000). During this 16-week period, 375 patients passed through the trauma surgery service. Data on the frequency of psychiatric consultations were compared with those for a retrospectively selected control group consisting of all 360 patients passing through the trauma surgery service during the corresponding 16 weeks of the previous year (March 1, 1999, through June 31, 1999). To determine the prevalence of psychopathology, eligible patients seen during the psychiatrist's shift (N = 28) were assessed with a semistructured interview, and charts for eligible patients seen in the corresponding shift during the previous year (N = 18) were assessed according to the same criteria. Before the study, a 10-item, self-report questionnaire was completed by 16 (73%) of the 22 emergency medicine physicians who serve as front-line staff members. The survey assessed physicians' attitudes toward psychiatric consultation for psychopathology and addictions in trauma patients. RESULTS: Based on DSM-IV screening criteria, the prevalence of preexisting psychopathology was 68% (19/28), but before the psychiatrist's involvement, only 12% (2/16) of physicians surveyed had considered consulting psychiatry, even for patients with gross psychopathology. Before the psychiatrist's integration into the 16-week study period, 75% (9/12) of trauma patients were discharged without psychiatric consultation despite the fact that more than half had documented substance abuse. After the psychiatrist joined the team, staff awareness of psychopathology sharpened. The number of patients treated for a psychiatric disorder that was often the proximal cause of the traumatic event nearly doubled, even on shifts not covered in the study. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to identify and treat coexisting psychopathology requires trauma surgeons to routinely incorporate a psychiatrist into their evaluation and treatment algorithm. Such a change in physician awareness and motivation hinges on a psychiatrist's visible presence (even if brief) and regular, active participation in the emergency department."}, {"Title": "Capacity Decisions in the General Hospital: When Can You Refuse to Follow a Person's Wishes?", "Abstract": "LESSONS LEARNED AT THE INTERFACE OF MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY: The Psychiatric Consultation Service at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) sees medical and surgical inpatients with comorbid psychiatric symptoms and conditions.

One realizes the need for objective interventions in order to make this process effective, such as the construction of a solid and amplified network for mental health care, the municipalization of health services which would reduce the risk of a fragmentation in services provided and would promote participation of family members and society in caring and reinserting mentally-ill patients."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry reform: analysis of power relations in mental health care services].", "Abstract": "This paper approaches the topic of Psychiatric Care Reform in Brazil and, particularly, in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, as well as the role played by a disciplinary power in modern society.

This study is based on Michel Foucalt's works, especially on his analysis of the power relationships, in order to elicit answers to our main question, to support the thesis we formulated, and to reach our goal, which is to ponder on the discrepancy we perceive between legal victories and the new speech delivered by the psychiatric care reformers, and on a practice which seems to deny emancipation to psychiatric sufferers, that is, deny their citizenship."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatric emergencies in drug addiction].", "Abstract": "The practitioner is very frequently confronted by emergencies in drug-addicted patients also having psychiatric symptomatology. In this article the authors will address emergencies related to alcohol (notably intoxication, pre-DTs and the encephalopathies); emergencies related to cannabis (notably intoxication, psychotic states and panic attacks); and emergencies related to other psycho-active substances (overdoses, drug-withdrawal, psychiatric complications related to cocaine or amphetamines). In the domain of drug addiction, as in psychiatry, the practitioner must give as much importance to the organisation of the long-term healthcare plan for the drug addict, ulterior to the management of the immediate emergency. For example, whereas 90% of subjects presenting to the emergency department for acute alcoholic intoxication have a pathological consumption of alcohol (abuse or dependance), management of the alcoholism is proposed in only 2% of them."}, {"Title": "[Emergency situations in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Emergencies in psychiatry depend both on the diagnosis of the pathology (past diagnosis or that revealed by the emergency), and on the situations that caused the crisis, of which their reactional nature demands specific treatment. There is an emergency when this is felt by any of the protagonists: the patient, the doctor or the entourage. The response in the environment can be indifferent, aggravating or pacifying. The behavioural outbursts in the agitated and aggressive situations necessitate a symptomatic treatment of the agitation, investigation of the underlying somatic or psychiatric pathology, and an evaluation of the milleu often at the origin of the aggravation or agitation. New types of emergency psychiatric consultations are currently being observed, underlaid by outbursts of anxieties and anguish, and this occuring across the board. Patients with diverse pathological anxieties arrive in the emergency department with an imperative demand to be relieved. Thus psychiatirc emergency go from behavioural to more intra-psychi situations, and necessitate an evaluation and an immediate response."}, {"Title": "Poststroke Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Pseudoseizures: A Discussion.", "Abstract": "LESSONS LEARNED AT THE INTERFACE OF MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY: The Psychiatric Consultation Service at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) sees medical and surgical inpatients with comorbid psychiatric symptoms and conditions.

No].", "Abstract": "According to the previous survey of postgraduate neurology education in Japan, there is a wide range of variability among training hospitals in terms of the number of neurologists available for the postgraduate education, the number of beds available for neurological teaching, facilities, the number of residents, diseases of main interests, and subspecialty fields within neurology. Practically speaking, therefore, it is not suitable and it is even impossible to completely standardize the way of postgraduate education throughout the country. 'Essential core curriculum' which consists of history taking and neurological examination, and education of basic neuroscience knowledge related to clinical neurology, combined with clinical neurophysiology including electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG), clinical neuropathology including muscle and nerve biopsy, and neuroradiology, could be standardized to a certain degree at least in part. Other related fields such as neuropsychology, rehabilitation, neuro-ophthalmology, pediatric neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry and neurogenetics can be educated in certain designated centers of each specific field depending on the resident's choice.

The greater availability of radiotracers for neurotransmitter synthesis/metabolism, enzymes, transporters and receptors, as well as neuromodulators and second messengers has enabled the evaluation of hypotheses regarding neurotransmitter function and regulation that are generated from basic neuroscience studies in animals, and the investigation of the neurochemical substrates of psychiatric disorders and the mechanism of action of psychotropic medications. This review will focus on the status of radiotracer development, on the clinical and methodological considerations regarding neurochemical brain imaging study design and data interpretation. The applications of neurochemical brain imaging methods to the study of specific psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, depression and Alzheimer's Disease, will be reviewed and potential future directions of research in these areas identified. Finally, the studies of the neurochemical substrates of personality traits will be reviewed. Thus far, fundamental observations have been made with respect to 1). detecting abnormalities in the availability of neurotransmitter transporter and receptor sites in psychiatric patients; 2). evaluating the relationship of these neurochemical measures to symptomatology; and 3). assessing the magnitude of occupancy of the initial target sites of action of psychotropic medication relative to treatment response and drug concentrations. Further advances in instrumentation and radiotracer chemistry will enable investigators to conduct pre-clinical and clinical mechanistic studies focused on other neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. These data will provide important insights into the neurochemical substrates of treatment response variability in psychiatric disorders that will have important implications for the refinement of pharmacotherapy."}, {"Title": "[The history of psychiatric nursing in Rio Grande do Sul: Part I].", "Abstract": "The objective of this article is to contribute towards the history and historiography of Psychiatric Nursing in Rio Grande do Sul by reconstituting the Professional School of Nursing that functioned from 1939 to 1952 at the S\u00e3o Pedro Hospital.

Chief sources included primarily mainstream journals in the fields of urology, psychiatry/psychology, impotence/erectile dysfunction, epidemiology, and internal medicine. MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were utilized.\nData from clinical studies, trials, and review articles concerned primarily with psychological aspects of the arousal (erectile function) phase of the male sexual response cycle were collected, analyzed, and summarized in this review article.\nThere has been a shift in how erectile dysfunction has been perceived and treated over the past 30 years. With the current focus now on the very prevalent organic causes of ED, psychological factors are increasingly overlooked, though they remain important to the treatment of the patient as a whole. This article provides a complete, concise review of the interplay between psychological components and erectile function, reviews the work-up and diagnosis of psychogenic ED, and discusses treatment methods.\nErectile dysfunction is a prevalent problem that can affect, and can be affected by, psychosocial aspects of a man's life. Medical or pharmacological interventions are often appropriate to treat ED, but the psychosocial aspects should not be ignored. It has become easier for practitioners to put aside patients' psychosocial and interpersonal concerns regarding sexual health. Clinicians provide the best possible treatment if they recognize that erectile dysfunction is a complex, multifactorial disorder, and treat accordingly."}, {"Title": "[Laser biostimulation in the treatment of pleurisy].", "Abstract": "Low-intensity lasers have been utilized in medicine in two ways: for local stimulation and for stimulation of acupuncture points. Literature data reveal that this method has been indiscriminately applied in psychiatry, rheumatology, gynecology, dermatology, otorhinolaryngology, in diverse acute and chronic pains, inflammations, vascular disorders, angina pectoris, bronchial asthma. Most commonly reported clinical effects are analgesia, spasmolytic and anti-inflammatory effects, as well as faster wound and bone healing.\nThis prospective study analyses effects of laser biostimulation on patients with pleurisy. The analysis included 25 patients treated at the Institute of Lung Diseases in Sremska Kamenica during 2000, 2001 and 2002. Apart from conservative treatment, these patients were treated with laser biostimulation of acupuncture points and local region for ten days. During treatment, changes of present clinical signs, general symptoms, radiological findings, as well as changes of some relevant biochemical parameters were recorded.\nResults were compared with the control group which included the same number of patients, who differed from the examined group only by not being exposed to laser biostimulation. The examined group of patients with pleuritis presented with quicker resorption of pleural effusion, less pleural adhesions, more significant decrease of clinical symptoms, especially pain, as well as more significant increase of cortisol and immunoglobulin A and decrease of circulating immune complexes (CIC), leukocytes and sedimentation rate than the control group.\nMechanisms of laser biostimulation in treatment of pleurisy were described in detail and the obtained results were correlated to those reported by other authors.\n1. Patients with pleurisy undergoing laser stimulation presented with faster resorption of effusion and remission of the subjective symptoms, as well as significant decrease of biochemical acute inflammation parameters in the peripheral blood and therefore with faster recovery. 2. In patients with pleurisy laser treatment increases regenerative mechanisms of the pleural surface, thus decreasing the quantity of formed adhesions and resulting in better mobility of the diaphragm."}, {"Title": "[Diagnosis of somatoform schizophrenia among patients treated in the last decade in the 1st Department of Psychiatry of Medical University in Gda\u0144sk in 1989-1999]].", "Abstract": "Neither ICD-10 nor DSM-IV use diagnosis of cenestopathic schizophrenia and suggest to put those cases in undifferentiated type (or different form) of schizophrenia. It seems that this diagnosis will disappear from any psychiatric glossary soon. However we still meet cases which match classical descriptions given by creators of term cenestopathic schizophrenia (Dupre, Huber, Bornsztajn). We analyzed the frequency of diagnosis of cenestopathic schizophrenia among patients treated in our department between 1989 and 1999 (about 6000 patients). After finding 15 such cases we tried to verify their diagnosis in order to exclude cases which could met criteria of any mental disorder according to ICD-10 (mainly well-defined form of schizophrenia or organic disorder). In this way we rejected 12 cases of 15 with primary diagnosis of cenestopathic schizophrenia. But we still could not match 3 cases whose symptoms closely reminded symptoms of classical cenestopathic schizophrenia and did not meet criteria of any kind of schizophrenia described in ICD-10. Since all these cases are very interesting and they troubled clinicians a lot, we describe them in details."}, {"Title": "[Translation and validation of a French version of the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)].", "Abstract": "Both the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and the Mania Assessment Scale (MAS) have been widely used during the last decade for the evaluation of severity of mania in clinical trials. For both scales good inter-rater reliability, validity and sensitivity to change have been reported. The French version of the MAS has been validated. To our know-ledge, the YMRS has not yet been translated into French and validated. The main objective of the present study was to validate a French version of the YMRS and to test its use in manic patients entering a study on the effectiveness of valproic acid and olanzapine combination. After translating the items in French, we tested this version of the YMRS on two samples of psychiatric patients recruited in a ward of adult inpatients (18 to 65 Years old) at the Department of Psychiatry, Geneva University Hospital. The first sample included 18 (hypo) manic inpatients (10 males, 8 females). Mean age was 37.0 (standard deviation 10.1). Interviews were video taped and assessed by three different judges on both scales (YMRS and MAS). The second sample included 20 inpatients (5 males, 15 females) who provided written informed consent to enter a study on the association of valproic acid and olanzapine in the treatment of mania. Mean age was 40.0 (standard deviation 11.3). Patients were followed over four weeks and assessed on both scales (YMRS and MAS) every seven days (day 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28). On day 7, patients were assessed during a joint interview by two of three judges who independently administered both scales in permuted order. On days 0, 14, 21 and 28, patients were evaluated by one of the same three raters. Inter-rater reliability was assessed by comparing item scores and total scores assigned by different judges with intra-class correlation coefficient ICC (2,1). Three judges were considered for patients in sample 1. Two judges were considered for patients in sample 2 (day 7 assessment). Concurrent validity with the MAS was analysed in sample 2 on days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 using Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient. Sensitivity to change was assessed in sample 2 by comparing total score at inclusion and at last observation using Wilcoxon signed ranks test. For both the MAS and YMRS, intraindividual change was calculated as the difference between total scores at inclusion and discharge (last observation carried forward approach). The relationship between changes on the two scales was analysed through Spearman correlation coefficient. Significance level was set to 0.05 for each test. Ranges of YMRS total scores were 2 to 32 in sample 1 and 1 to 28 in sample 2, indicating symptom severity from euthymic to moderately manic. Inter-rater reliability was very good for the total scores in both samples, both for the MAS and the YMRS (ICC>0.89). When considering YMRS individual items, correlation coefficient varied from 0.61 to 0.96 in the first sample. In the second sample, 9 of 11 items displayed values above 0.63. The remaining two items, increased motor activity and energy and Language-thought disorder, presented modest inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.54 and 0.50 respectively). This was largely attributable to a single patient, who was perceived very differently by the two judges (scores 0-2 for increased motor activity and energy; 1-4 for Language-thought disorder). When this patient was excluded, intra-class correlation coefficients were above 0.69 for both items. Overall, inter-rater reliability of the YMRS items was in the same range as for the MAS items (0.61-0.96 vs 0.61-0.93 in sample 1; 0.50-0.93 vs 0.54-0.83 in sample 2). Correlation between the two instruments was very high and statistically significant at each weekly assessment (rs>0.91, p<0.001) except for day 21 which displayed a somewhat lower correlation (rs=0.75, p<0.01). This latter result was attributed to a reduced spread of values and number of patients on day 21. YMRS and MAS total scores as a function of time in patients receiving combined treatment with olanzapine and valproic acid (sample 2) show that for both at for both scales, total scores significantly decreased from day 0 to last observation (Wilcoxon signed ranks test, p<0.001), with median decrease of 18 points both on the YMRS (range 9-32) and MAS (range 10-33). Median relative decrease was 67% for the YMRS and 69% for the MAS. When analysing the relationship between intraindividual changes on the YMRS and MAS, highly significant correlation was observed (Spearman rs=0.93, p<0.001), showing that the two scales were virtually interchangeable in assessing treatment efficacy. In conclusion, the YMRS is a simple and easy-to-use instrument for measuring severity of manic symptoms The newly translated French version was satisfactory in terms of inter-rater reliability, concurrent validity with the MAS, and sensitivity to change in patients receiving treatment for manic symptoms. This should allow its future use for international comparison studies."}, {"Title": "Relevance of imidazoline receptors and agmatine to psychiatry: a decade of progress.", "Abstract": "The cardiovascular relevance of imidazoline receptors (IR) has received tremendous attention since their discovery in 1984. However, evidence also has accumulated for the relevance of IR and an endogenous ligand, agmatine, to psychiatric disease. Emphasis has been placed on altered levels of the I(1)-imidazoline site on human platelets and in human postmortem brain tissue from depressed patients. Attempts at exploring the molecular nature of the I(1) protein have led to the cloning of a protein, IRAS. Based on transfection studies, IRAS seems to be involved in neuronal plasticity events. The I(2) site also appears linked to psychiatric research since some of these sites are localized to a specific domain on monoamine oxidases. Different peptides have been identified by means of an imidazoline-receptor-binding-protein (IRBP) antiserum, and these peptides, some of which appear to be fragments derived from IRAS, undergo changes in platelets and brain commensurate with altered mood states of the subject, notably depressive symptomatology. The search for an endogenous ligand for imidazoline receptor(s) also has led to agmatine, a decarboxylated derivative of arginine. Research on agmatine has mushroomed over the past several years and its measurement in the blood and brain has opened new research opportunities. This novel neurotransmitter interacts with a variety of receptors and has been implicated in mediation of stress responses, analgesia, drug addiction and withdrawal, convulsions, and neuroprotection. Given that IR and agmatine appear involved in a multitude of neurophysiologic and pathologic functions, the potential for new drug development is intriguing."}, {"Title": "End-of-life care in geriatric psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Depression, anxiety and delirium are relatively common during the final stages of terminal disease, and each can profoundly impact the quality of those last days for both patient and involved family.

Even before the 19th century, there had been institutions for the mentally ill, such as the Bethlem in London which was founded more than 750 years ago, and organised forms of care in the community for people with mental illness, such as the tradition of family care in Geel in Belgium. Modern psychiatry, however, was initiated through the spirit of enlightenment and began around 1800. This beginning was marked by the symbolic cutting of the chains of mentally ill patients in Paris, the first publication of the term 'psychiatry' (\"Psychiatric\") in Germany in 1803, and the establishment of the retreat in York, England. The rise of modern psychiatry as a speciality of medicine was closely linked to the development of new institutions in both health care and academia. In the 19th century, various universities established chairs and academic departments of psychiatry, and large asylums for the mentally ill were built across Europe. The asylums were meant to replace the family as carriers for the material needs of patients--since many families could not fulfill that function in an industrialising society anymore--remove the mentally ill from the public scenes of urban life and provide a therapeutic environment."}, {"Title": "[Effect of war on alcoholism].", "Abstract": "To investigate and analyze the effect of the war upon the representation of the hospitalized alcoholics at the Department of Psychiatry at the Clinical Hospital of Mostar.

All the patients were hospitalized at the Department of Psychiatry of the Clinical Hospital of Mostar. The classical medical procedure and the biomedical diagnostics parametry were used to make a diagnosis.\nTotal number of the hospitalized at the Department of Psychiatry in the war period (year 1994) amounted to 329 patients, out of who 25.5% due to alcoholism.

This article outlines some key scientific and ethical principles of clinical explanation in twenty-first century psychiatry. Recent work in philosophy of science, clinical psychiatry, and psychiatric ethics are critically reviewed in order to elucidate conceptual underpinnings of contemporary explanatory models. Many explanatory models in psychiatry are reductionistic or eclectic. The former restrict options for diagnostic and therapeutic paradigm choice, while the latter lack a well-defined theoretical basis. These two methodological approaches stand in a dialectical relation to one another insofar as clinicians often move from one approach to its antithesis, ultimately seeking a synthesis of the two approaches that satisfies clinical needs. Pragmatic considerations can help to transcend the reductionism/eclecticism dialectic. In the absence of a completed science of mental disorders, psychiatrists must tolerate ambiguity and uncertainty as they strive to integrate diverse explanatory concepts in a rigorous and evidence-based fashion. A pragmatic explanatory model in clinical psychiatry must focus on favorable treatment outcomes for patients by respecting the pluralistic, participatory, and provisional nature of psychiatric explanation."}, {"Title": "[Male and female suicides in the material of Department of Forensic Medicine in Krakow--comparative analysis].", "Abstract": "The study presents the results of research into completed suicide obtained by cooperation between the Department of Forensic Medicine and the University Psychiatry Department in Krak\u00f3w.

The two intentions meet as far as the recognition of a clinical case straight through space and time supports the ontological status of a disease entity. An autobiographical work from 1801 \"My insanity in the year 1783\" written by the Danish vicar C.S. Andresen, who lived from 1760 to 1832 is briefly summed up. Andresen tells that he as a young student of divinity made a journey from the small town R\u00f8rvig in Zeeland to his then place in Copenhagen. The weather was intolerably hot, the coach was uncomfortable, the landscape deserted and empty-and just in the hardships the most unhappy and deplorable event happened: He faced the gruesome truth that he was deprived of the most precious gift of his Creator, his reason and faculties. A fellow passenger brought him to an inn where he literally ran up the walls alternately in high spirits and in deep dispair. When he arrived in Copenhagen he was blead, probably by a surgeon, but later that day admitted to King Frederik's Hospital where he was treated with bleds and leechs and baths. However, as the illness dragged on he was according to his own will accompanied by his custodian to his parental home in the Isle of Bornholm where he recovered while nursed by his mother and mother's mother who themselves had suffered from periodical melancholy when they were young. He completed his academic studies and became a highly respected scholar and vicar in the isle of Funen - but almost twenty years after his recovery he was made to suffer the humiliation that he - a true representative of the Age of Enlightment and rationalistic theologician - was suspected to have invoted his insanity by a sinful life in his youth. Thus his work may be regarded as a defensive pamphlet written at a time when a neutral and clinical view of mental diseases had given place to a moralistic and religious concept. The case serves as a modification of the general assumption that psychotic patients in \"the classic age of confinement\" under all circumstances were brutally treated and locked up. Even the fluent and subjective style is charming and reminds the Danes of Johannes Ewald (1743-81) and perhaps - were it to be translated - the English of Lawrence Sterne (1713-68).

Special emphasis was placed on the traditional social structure and the roles of various players. The different stages of development are described in relation to the major social events in African families and communities. Psychomotor development in African children presents several particularities in relation to children in the industrialized world but differences tend to decrease as a result of ongoing social upheaval. Modernization or globalization has had a profound effect on family organization and child care. These changes must be taken into account by officials in charge of child-psychiatry services. Preventive initiatives should taken into account and, insofar as possible, preserve traditional familial resources."}, {"Title": "Applying a 'stages of change' model to enhance a traditional evaluation of a research transfer course.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to utilize an evaluation tool based on Prochaska's model of change in order to assess behaviour change as part of an evaluation process for a research transfer training programme (RTTP). The RTTP was a training programme offered to scientists in a psychiatry department and research institute to gain skills in research transfer. In addition to a traditional course evaluation framework evaluating overall satisfaction with the course and whether or not learning objectives were met, an additional 'stages of change' evaluation tool designed to assess change along a continuum was utilized. This instrument measured change in participants' attitudes, intentions and actions with respect to research transfer practice and consisted of a 12-question survey completed by participants prior to taking the course and 3 months post-course. In two out of the three categories, attitudes and intention to practice, there was positive change from pre- to post-course (P < 0.05). Although there was a trend of increased RT-related action, this was less robust and did not reach significance. For the RTTP transfer course, a 'stages of change' model of evaluation provided an enhanced understanding by showing changes in participants that would otherwise have been overlooked if only changes in RT behaviour were measured. Additionally, evaluating along a change continuum specifically identifies areas for improvement in future courses. The instrument developed for this study could also be used as a pre-course, participant needs assessment to tailor a course to the change needs of participants. Finally, this 'stages of change' approach provides insight into where barriers to change may exist for research transfer action."}, {"Title": "Child and adolescent psychiatry workforce: a critical shortage and national challenge.", "Abstract": "Despite the decades-long projection of an increasing utilization of child and adolescent psychiatry services and an undersupply of child and adolescent psychiatrists, the actual growth and supply of child and adolescent psychiatrists have been very slow. Inadequate support in academic institutions, decreasing graduate medical education (GME) funding, decreasing clinical revenues in the managed care environment, and a devalued image of the profession have made academic child and adolescent psychiatry programs struggle for recruitment of both residents and faculty, although child and adolescent psychiatry has made impressive progress in its scientific knowledge base through research, especially in neuroscience and developmental science. While millions of young people suffer from severe mental illnesses, there are only about 6,300 child and adolescent psychiatrists practicing in the United States. There is also a severe maldistribution of child and adolescent psychiatrists, especially in rural and poor, urban areas where access is significantly reduced. By any method of workforce analysis, it is evident that there will continue to be a shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists well into the future. Medical/psychiatric educators have a mission to encourage medical students and general psychiatry residents to enter child and adolescent psychiatry and provide crucial mental health care and health care advocacy for our country's youngest and most vulnerable citizens.

Reasons for optimism include: features of the specialty, such as its focus on the doctor/patient relationship; its increasing job availability and incomes; its scientific achievements; the peaking and possible fading of the National Generalist Initiative; and a 5-year upward recruitment trend. Concerns are: low \"overt\" interest in psychiatry among entering medical students; clerkship directors' perceptions of a negative educational impact of managed care; graduating seniors' suboptimal satisfaction with their psychiatry clerkships; and what is likely to be a small impact of New Mexico legislation on prescribing privileges for psychologists.

Since the Consultation-Liaison (\"C-L\") psychiatrist may be asked to consult on a patient with any medical illness, e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), malaria, cancer, stroke, amytrophic, lateral sclerosis, and a patient who may be on any medical drug, methods need to be developed to review the recent literature and have an awareness of key and essential current findings. At the same time, teachers need to develop a current listing of seminal papers for trainees and practitioners of this newest cross-over subspecialty of psychiatry-now called Psychosomatic Medicine. Experts selected because of their writings and acknowledged contributions to a specific clinical area or problem hope examined thousands of citations to choose those articles, chapters, books, or letters that they regard as most important to Psychosomatic Medicine. In addition, psychiatric specialists in six countries have provided their national Psychosomatic Medicine (Consultation-Liaison) lists as examples of what they regard as the most important teaching materials journals: Australia, Brazil, Greece, Mexico, Portugal, and Taiwan.

The paper outlines the inadequate mental health service in Malawi, Central Africa, which as well as failing patients obstructs the training of health workers.\nA new mental health curriculum at Malawi's medical school is described. The notion of psychiatry as a medical specialty is abandoned and the focus moved to psychological and psychiatric factors as they present in general clinical settings and primary care. Students are encouraged to consider how they may address mental health issues through the many and varied roles which doctors in resource poor countries must fulfil (administrator, trainer, primary health care doctor, hospital physician).\nThis training strategy accords with a shift of attention among health service planners world-wide from specialist services towards primary care, and may generalize to other settings in which specialist clinical services are poorly developed."}, {"Title": "Clinical experience of medical students in a developing country.", "Abstract": "This paper compares the clinical experience in acute conditions of the undergraduate students of a medical school from a developing country (Malaysia) with those from a developed country (UK).\nThis study was conducted at the School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM).

Besides isolating episodic twilight states, involutional paranoia and symptomatic (especially influenza) psychoses, he was particularly involved in applying Wernicke's syndromatic and Kraepelin's prognostic and aetiological principles to classify \"neurogenous\" psychoses by refuting the assumption of mixed entities whenever possible. Thus, has phasophrenias denoted manic-depressive illness, unipolar affective disorders and marginal, i.e., atypical psychoses. The rather benign cycloid psychoses form the most prominent examples of the latter. Schizophrenias, on the other hand, were limited to poor long-term catamnestic outcomes. Kleist conceptualized the core group of schizophrenic illness as psychic system diseases-hence the origin of the term \"systematic schizophrenias\" within the Wernicke-Kleist-Leonhard School. Kleist was mainly influenced by Wernicke and his psychic reflex arc, but Ernst Mach's empiriocriticism, Theodor Meynert's cerebral connectionism, and associationism also shaped his outlook. Kleist's localization of cerebral functions by lesion analyses was indeed the best available at the time and continues to reveal insights to the interested reader. From his Frankfurt School, which may have been the last of a completely unified neuropsychiatry, came sound representatives of psychiatry, neurology and neurosurgery. His technical mastery and achievements seem indisputable, but his balancing acts during the Third Reich may today be questioned. Despite joining the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) and the local Court of Genealogical Health (Erbgesundheitsgericht), Kleist was, however, one of the few German physicians who continued to treat Jewish patients, to employ Jewish colleagues and to voice evident criticism of the policies of \"eugenics\" and \"euthanasia\".

Older people often lack the ability to verbalize their emotional problems, which is an obvious prerogative for expressing the wish for psychotherapy. However elderly people tend to indulge in childhood memories, and therefore would be excellent candidates for psychoanalytic-orientated treatment. Because objective time is not a factor in subconscious life, older people can suffer from unsolved intrapsychic-, intra- and intergenerational conflicts and trauma reactivations. Without considering these psychological conflicts, the most important fields for psychotherapeutic intervention in the elderly are depression, mild cognitive impairment, incipient demential syndromes, and the impairment of psychosocial competence resulting from these conditions; caregiver-related therapy also plays an important role. For those between 65 and 75 years of age, the indications for psychotherapy are similar to those of younger adults: first of all depression, anxiety-syndromes, insomnia and suicidal attempts. For those over 75 years old, isolation, polymorbidity, preservation of autonomy and self-determination, and the fear of loosing autonomy and becoming care-dependent are the most important indications for psychotherapy. A feature common to all psychotherapeutic schools is that they try to overcome disturbances, to reduce emotional pain, to preserve, establish and improve psychosocial competency and the activities of daily living. Psychotherapy in a narrow sense is indicated when the psychic structure, the mental flexibility and the motivational state are quite good and if differentiated verbal interactions are possible. In a broader sense, psychotherapy stands for actional and training aspects, and integral environmental and socio-therapeutic treatment so that autonomy and quality of life can be properly improved. This definition of psychotherapy makes it obvious that demented and care-dependent patients are potential candidates for psychotherapy."}, {"Title": "War, exile, moral knowledge and the limits of psychiatric understanding: a clinical case study of a Bosnian refugee in London.", "Abstract": "This paper describes a Bosnian refugee, a survivor of war and ethnic cleansing, during a 3-year follow-up in a psychiatry clinic.\nThis case throws light on the tension between medicotherapeutic and sociomoral ways of understanding the effects of such experiences, and of the limitations of morally and politically neutral psychiatric categories and technologies. Suffering always invokes questions of values: in this case the clinical picture represented a moral protest at what had been done with such impunity, and a refusal to accommodate to a world which now seemed unintelligible. The clinical picture also embodied the collective outrage, and sense of unfinished business, which many back in Bosnia itself were carrying in the wake of the 1995 Dayton peace accords which effectively legitimised the lines of ethnic cleansing.\nDSM or ICD diagnoses of depressive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder turned out to lack validity and explanatory power. Claims that victims of war and atrocity typically have an unmet need for mental health services are overstated. Recovery from the effects of war may depend on reestablishing a sense of intelligibility, a task that must primarily go on in social space rather than mental space."}, {"Title": "[Experimental studies in Polish psychiatric journals].", "Abstract": "Scientific studies in psychiatry from a methodological point of view could be divided into correlational and experimental.

Seventy patients with schizophrenia were examined five times: before, during and after 8-week pharmacological treatment.

Also, there is a statistical significant correlation between the emotional blunting and the general patients' condition; decrease of emotional blunting during pharmacological treatment improves the results of CGI. Severity of emotional blunting before treatment is a predictive factor of its severity after treatment. There were no significant associations between the emotional blunting and other analysed factors: age, gender, number of hospitalizations, duration of illness, dose of drugs, global result of PANSS and severity of depressive symptoms."}, {"Title": "Determinants and pattern of postpartum psychological disorders in Hazara division of Pakistan.", "Abstract": "The risk of psychological disorders in women increases during the postpartum period.

Suicide accounted for 28% of maternal deaths. Women also died from other complications of psychiatric disorder and a significant minority from substance misuse. Some of the findings of the Confidential Enquiry confirm long established knowledge about postpartum psychiatric disorder. The findings highlight the severity and early onset of serious postpartum mental illness and of the risk of recurrence following childbirth faced by women with a previous history of serious mental illness either following childbirth or at other times. These findings led to the recommendation that all women should be asked early in their pregnancy about a previous history of serious psychiatric disorder and that management plans should be in place with regard to the high risk of recurrence following delivery. Other findings of the Enquiry were new and challenged some of the accepted wisdoms of obstetrics and psychiatry. It is likely that the suicide rate following delivery is not significantly different to other times in women's lives and for the first 42 days following delivery may be elevated. This calls into question the so-called 'protective effect of maternity'. The overwhelming majority of the suicides died violently, contrasting with the usual finding that women are more likely to die from an overdose of medication. Compared to other causes of maternal death, the suicides were older and socially advantaged. The Enquiry findings suggest that the risk profile for women at risk of suicide following delivery may be different to that in women at other times and in men. None of the women who died had been admitted at any time to a Mother and Baby Unit and their psychiatric care had been undertaken by General Adult Services. None of the women who died had had a previous episode correctly identified and none had had adequate plans for their proactive care. The conclusion is that there is a need for both Psychiatry and Obstetrics to acknowledge the substantial risk that women with a previous psychiatric history of serious mental illness face following delivery."}, {"Title": "Training in evidence-based practice.", "Abstract": "Controversy surrounds the concept of EBP. Many individuals question whether research is capable of guiding decisions about diagnosis and treatment, or whether it simply gives oversimplified answers to highly complex questions about human behavior. These concerns aside, it is hard to envision a future in which consumers and payers do not demand that the health professions ground their interventions in an evidence base. It is sobering to recognize that training in EBP has been far from the norm in the various behavioral health disciplines. This is just one aspect of a much larger crisis in behavioral health workforce education. Graduate and residency programs have not kept pace with many of the changes in behavioral health care delivery over the past decade. The field continues to use continuing education strategies that are ineffective, and little training is offered to the paraprofessional and bachelor-prepared staff members who comprise a large segment of the workforce in public sector and inpatient settings. Broad strategies are needed to overcome the lethargy in behavioral health education and training programs to make them more relevant to contemporary clinical practice. Incorporating evidence-based approaches to treatment is one critical element of needed reforms. General medicine has laid a foundation that can be built on for teaching the process of EBP. Psychiatry and psychology have taken the lead in identifying those interventions to be taught that are evidence-based or empirically supported. Research on continuing education and adult learning illuminates the educational strategies that are likely effective in teaching evidence-based interventions and an evidence-based process of care. Additionally, the research on changing provider behavior shows the importance of ensuring practice environments that support and reinforce, rather than thwart, the practice of evidence-based treatment. There are many resources to draw on but the task facing educators is substantial."}, {"Title": "[Subjectively-perceived inappropriate treatment of depressed patients in general and psychiatric practice].", "Abstract": "In the present study, process quality in outpatient depression care was documented by general practitioners and specialists in psychiatry. Opportunities to improve inpatient treatment were identified by comparing current physicians' treatment procedures with guideline recommendations and, furthermore, by evaluating treatment outcomes from the patients' perspective. Data of 350 depressed outpatients were collected by 43 GPs and 23 specialists in psychiatry in three study regions (Rhineland, South Baden and Munich). Data reflected psychopathology, diagnostic assessment, investigation of suicidal intentions as well as somatic and psychotherapeutic measures at the first visit. Additionally, change in depression symptoms after six to eight weeks by means of self-rating (n = 165) and expert rating (n = 70) was measured. The study shows that the GPs and, to a lesser extent, the specialists, still fail to orient themselves towards guideline recommendations regarding assessment, therapy and referral in depression care. These findings seem to be reflected in insufficient self rated treatment outcome: one half of the patients reported a reduction in depression symptoms, the other half of patients reported stagnation or even progression. Expert ratings of treatment courses were more positive. The results indicate a considerable need for guideline training and improvement of networking and co-operation between GPs and specialists as well as between inpatient and outpatient settings."}, {"Title": "Careers in child health nursing: the influence of course experiences.", "Abstract": "Findings presented in this paper are drawn from a longitudinal study of nurses' careers (Robinson et al 1998, 1999).

Overall, course experiences were more likely to encourage than discourage diplomates from wanting to work in a particular specialty; this was the case for 19 of the 23 specialties. Course experiences were significantly more likely to have discouraged than encouraged diplomates from considering working in theatres and psychiatry. Seventy-seven per cent of respondents (417) had obtained a first job in their preferred clinical specialty.

Questionnaires were mailed to the participants.\nThere was wide variation within the three readability parameters: reading ease varied from easy to difficult, personal interest from tedious/scientific to very interesting/illustrated magazines and the quick reading test varied from formal to very popular. Two brochures were tedious and formal. As to the content, only three were significantly considered 'very interesting for patients' (P < 0.05). Most were found to be clear and not too long. Concrete information about administration, dosage and duration of therapy appeared to be absent from several leaflets. Adverse effects and possible complications were thought to be well rendered in most screened sources. According to the respondents, the role of the pharmacist was not sufficiently mentioned.\nOnly three leaflets appeared to be suitable as a patient-oriented information tool.

Conventional clinic measures of adversity predicted disability in mixed disorders. For emotional disorders, and those cases with no diagnosed disorder, clinically measured adversity and Jarman scores interacted.\nPostcode related census data capture information about clinic children's presenting disability that is not available from routine clinic assessment of psychosocial adversity. It should therefore be collected as part of the routine clinical child psychiatry assessment."}, {"Title": "Community attitudes toward and knowledge of mental illness in South Africa.", "Abstract": "Although recent advances in psychiatry have increased our understanding of psychiatric disorders,many people with chronic or severe psychiatric disorders may be unaware that effective treatment is available. It is possible that ignorance and stigma prevent such persons from seeking appropriate help, and that community attitudes and beliefs play a role in determining the help-seeking behaviour and successful treatment of the mentally ill. Nevertheless, there is little research on the attitudes of lay persons toward mental illness within the South African community.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of the general South African public toward mental illness, specifically regarding the causes of illness and treatment options.\nThe study design employed a questionnaire survey. Structured interviews (n = 667) were conducted with members of the general public. One of eight vignettes, portraying depression, schizophrenia, panic disorder or substance abuse, with subtle or obvious symptoms, was presented to each respondent.\nThe main findings were that cases were most often conceptualised as stress-related or due to a lack of willpower rather than as medical disorders. Treatment advocated was more often to talk the problem over than to consult professional medical help. Psychotherapy was the preferred treatment option, particularly in vignettes where symptom presentation was subtle, and in cases of substance abuse.\nThese data suggest that stigma and misinformation regarding mental illness exist, influencing preferred treatment modality and help-seeking behaviour. More work needs to be done to educate the public about the psychobiological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders and about the value of effective treatments. A better understanding of these disorders amongst the public would presumably lessen stigmatisation and encourage the use of currently available and effective interventions."}, {"Title": "[Study on the disabilities in aged 0-7 years children in Shenzhen, China].", "Abstract": "To explore the prevalence of vision, mental, audibility, language, psychiatry, extremity, and influence factors in the 0 - 7 year olds.\nA total number of 77,727 0 - 7 year old children living in Shenzhen city were tested with tree phase screening under the Chinese standard of evaluation in disabilities.\nThe prevalence of all disabilities was 5.59 per thousand (adjusted rate was 8.49 per thousand with a false negative of 3.1 per thousand ). The prevalence of mental disease was the highest (1.88 per thousand, with adjusted rate 3.43 per thousand ), the prevalence of language disability was 1.88 per thousand (including retarded language development, with adjusted rate 3.43 per thousand ). The prevalence rates of psychiatry, extremity and audibility disability were 1.59 per thousand, 1.56 per thousand, 1.11 per thousand respectively with of vision the lowest (0.37 per thousand ). The prevalence of all disabilities, audibility, language and mental was on the increase with age. The difference was statistically significant. Among all different age groups regarding psychiatric disease, the highest fell in the 2 - 4 year olds. The prevalence of extremity was not statistically different among age groups. The suspected agents of disease which occurred before or during pregnancy took up 45.7%.\nThe prevalence of six kinds disabilities in Shenzhen was about 10 per thousand lower than that of the samples of the nation in 1989, but two times higher than that of similar studies in Japan.

Some branches of medicine such as psychiatry, internal medicine and neurology have tried to confront the situation by joint treatment of addicted patients. Dentistry has so far remained outside this multi-disciplinary care despite the fact that the status of dental and other tissues in the oral cavity influences general health and vice versa. The aim of the survey on the oral health of drug addicts that was conducted in the Czech Republic from 2000 to 2002 was to collect data to help dental professionals contribute to the complex care of drug addicts. The number of addicted persons examined was 400 and the subgroup of drug addicts consisted of 217 subjects (mean age 23.87 yrs, SD 6.70), all being treated in long term hospitals. Among other oral health features observed, the DMFT and CPITN indices are presented in this paper. The results show severe dental and periodontal tissue destruction in young addicts and two case reports are included. The above survey indicates that dental treatment should become a part of standard care for addicted patients in long-term hospitals. Furthermore, if severe oral tissue impairment in young persons whether in dental practice or during autopsy is encountered a drug addiction should be suspected. If so, the treatment of the person or examination of the dead body should accordingly be adjusted."}, {"Title": "On the psycho- in psychophysiology: notes for a history of the mind-body effect.", "Abstract": "One hundred and twenty-five years of the dialogue between psychology and physiology reveal a vibrant discussion about the mind-body effect--the ability of waking consciousness to influence its own normally unconscious physiology through conscious intention, and conversely, the reciprocal effect of physiology on consciousness. In the early phase, the data remained largely anecdotal. Scientific study of the emotions then opened the door to dynamic theories of the subconscious. Such formulations, however, were repeatedly overshadowed by concurrent advances in brain neurophysiology, which rejected not only any exploration of the unconscious that relied on the method of symbolism, but also the reality of the unconscious itself. Nevertheless, scientific advances at the interface between psychology and physiology persisted. Since the 1950s, however, there has been an explosion of new work in the neurosciences at the interface between molecular genetics, endocrinology, neurology, immunology, and psychiatry. This has fueled both new research and renewed discussion about the mind-body effect, a dialogue that is now, in part, also a response to a counter-culture revolution occurring at the interface between the delivery of clinical services throughout the healthcare professions and an increasingly sophisticated consumer demand for alternative and complementary therapies."}, {"Title": "[Care structures for drug dependent children and adolescents].", "Abstract": "Children and adolescents abusing drugs present a special challenge for our health system.

A large proportion of the patients at completed suicide was aged within the thirties to fifties. The majority of patients suffered from either F3 (mood disorders) or F2 (schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders) categories of the ICD-10 classification. Approximately one-fifth of the patients in Fukuoka prefecture had jobs at the time of completed suicide. The main \"occupational risk factors\" that were found to be risks for suicide were \"failure or overloaded responsibilities in their jobs\" and \"worsening business situation\". The main \"other risk factors\", i.e., risk factors other than \"occupational risk factors\" were \"worsening psychiatric conditions\", \"personal life events (e.g., somatic illness or marital discord)\" and \"life events in other family members (e.g., familial discord or familial problems)\". Over 50% of all cases had both \"occupational risk factors\" and \"other risk factors\", suggestive of the necessity for multidimensional evaluation and care in the treatment of suicidal patients. Given that numerous males that suffer from psychiatric disorders commit suicide without seeing a psychiatrist, it is important to establish a system to treat them appropriately in order to prevent unnecessary deaths."}, {"Title": "[Assessment of \"self and other perception\" of parents in family court disputes based on the Giessen Test].", "Abstract": "30 couples were assessed using the Giessen-Test in regard to their self-images and how they were perceived by their partners.

The degree of symmetry and correspondence regarding gender positions and the degree of confirmation/negation of the position were pointed out. No sex differences could be found in regard to role attribution. Sings of sex-specific role perception could not be shown amongst the couples being part of the domestic proceedings. Sex-specific differences in regard to the image as perceived by the other parent do not exist any more. The exact complementary role of ones own role-perception is being attributed to the former partner. The role-characteristics attributed to the former partner can be described as dominant, under-controlled, hypomanic, and inaccessible.

In this study we evaluated the ability of these scales to differentiate between citalopram and placebo in the recurrence prevention of unipolar depression. The study is a psychometric reexamination of a trial on the efficacy of citalopram versus placebo in the maintenance therapy of elderly patients with unipolar depression. Internal validity (the Cronbach coefficient alpha, the Loevinger coefficient of homogeneity, and factor analysis) of the three scales has been examined to evaluate their unidimensionality. In the outcome analysis for depression recurrence, the conventional cutoff scores of the three scales are used. In total, 60 patients received citalopram and 61 patients received placebo in the maintenance phase of 48 weeks. The results showed that the internal validity was higher for MES and MADRS than for HAM-D. Using the MADRS, 67.2 % of the patients on placebo and 31.6 % of the patients on citalopram developed a depression recurrence (ratio 2.12); using HAM-D17, 42.6 % on placebo and 13.3 % on citalopram developed a depression recurrence (ratio 3.20); and using the MES, 34.4 % on placebo and 11.7 % on citalopram developed a depression recurrence (ratio 2.94). The conventional cutoff scores of HAM-D17 and MES for depression recurrence indicated a ratio between citalopram and placebo of around 3, while the conventional cutoff scores of MADRS for depression recurrence indicated a ratio of only around 2. In future trials on the recurrence prevention of unipolar depression, a cutoff score of 25 rather than 22 on the MADRS is recommended."}, {"Title": "[Alcohol and drugs and their relation to criminal recidivism].", "Abstract": "This report assesses the influence of alcohol- and drug- induced disorders on criminal recidivism.

Existing theories on the morphe and structure of human cells, tissues, and organs were enlarged by models focusing on the function of these elements and structures of the organism. This enlargement of etiopathogenic concepts, including biperspective observation, occurred in the fields of internal medicine (Gustav von Bergmann), psychiatry (Erwin Straus), and neurology (Kurt Goldstein). In the light of Goldsteins's understanding of the Babinski phenomenon, the present paper seeks to show what fundamental questions spring from a theory of the human organism that takes into account both morphe and structure and function. Studies of historical models of this kind are both meaningful and justified in that they include constructs and guiding theoretical principles (like, for instance, biperspective access to the patient and his/her disease) which are of immediate relevance in addressing problems with which psychosomatics and medicine are challenged today."}, {"Title": "[Madhouse, asylum, retreat, specialist hospital - on the genesis and history of names for psychiatric institutions in Germany until the beginning of the 20th century].", "Abstract": "This paper analyses the history of names for psychiatric institutions in the German language. When scientific, medical psychiatry came into being in the late 18 (th) century, names with negative connotations such as \"Narrenhaus\" or \"Tollhaus\" (approximating to the English word \"madhouse\") were substituted by the then neutral \"Irrenhaus\" and later in the 19 (th) century by \"Irrenanstalt\". Soon, however, this new term became associated with negative connotations, making it unsuitable as a reflection of the many improvements made both in the treatment and the public image of psychiatric service users. Changes in word form such as \"Heilanstalt\", \"Pflegeanstalt\" and \"Heil- und Pflegeanstalt\" better reflect the character of the institutions. Objections to the word \"Anstalt\" (institution) were not acknowledged until the 20 (th) century when the term \"Fachkrankenhaus\" (\"specialist hospital\") was introduced. Before then the German word \"Klinik\" was reserved for university hospitals, the first of which was founded in 1878. The history of names for psychiatric institutions reflects both changes in the treatment of the mentally ill and the attempts made above all by psychiatrists to face and overcome stigmatisation of their clients."}, {"Title": "[Current topics of social-psychiatric research in German speaking countries: a content analysis of scientific journals].", "Abstract": "The paper is aimed at investigating what the actual topics of social-psychiatric research in German speaking countries are.\nGerman and international journals covering psychiatry and adjacent disciplines were screened for articles dealing with social-psychiatric topics.

Increasing evidence indicates that neuroleptics can induce weight gain, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanisms underlying these conditions have not been fully elucidated. In this review, we describe molecular neuroanatomic aspects of current biology of energy homeostasis that would help to address the psychiatric issues noted above, focusing on the central leptin/melanocortin system. An adipocyte-derived hormone, leptin acts on the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus (Arc) to inhibit feeding behavior and simultaneously to promote energy expenditure. Leptin activates Arc neurons producing alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and inhibits those producing agouti-related protein (AgRP). alpha-MSH is an endogenous agonist for the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) that is expressed exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS), whereas AgRP acts as a MC4-R antagonist. It is also established that MC4-R blockade produces an over-eating/obesity syndrome in rodents and humans. Thus, MC4-R-expressing neurons are downstream targets of leptin. Of interest, MC4-R-positive neurons densely populate in CNS sites critical for energy homeostasis and associated with psychiatric disorders, including the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus and central amygdaloid nucleus. In addition, Arc alpha-MSH neurons receive serotonergic inputs from raphe neurons. Finally, an AgRP gene polymorphism has been associated with anorexia nervosa. These findings suggest that the central melanocortin system is a target for psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Quantitative spectral analysis of EEG in psychiatry revisited: drawing signs out of numbers in a clinical setting.", "Abstract": "To evaluate the incidence, sensitivity and specificity of abnormal quantitative EEG (QEEG) measures in normal subjects and patients with mental disorders.\nNormalized QEEG measures were blindly assessed in 67 normal human beings and 340 psychiatric patients. QEEG results were correlated to subject condition or diagnosis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings.\nQEEG was abnormal in 83% of patients, and 12% of normal subjects. The most frequent abnormality was a decrease in slow (delta and/or theta) bands, either alone, with beta increase, or with alpha decrease, followed by increase in beta band. No normal subject showed delta and/or theta decrease. Slow band decrease was more frequent in depression and mental disorders due to general medical condition, alcohol and drug dependence. However, no pattern was specific of any entity, and patients within the same diagnostic may present different patterns. Delta-theta decrease was correlated with cortical atrophy as seen in MRI. Beta increase was correlated with psychoactive medication. No association was found between any other QEEG pattern and MRI abnormalities, or medication.\nDecrease in the delta and theta bands of the QEEG can be regarded as a specific sign of brain dysfunction, and is correlated with cortical atrophy. However, this sign, as other QEEG abnormal patterns, can be found in many different disorders and none of them can be considered as pathognomonic of any specific disorder.\nThis work attempted to circumvent the alleged lack of Class I evidence of QEEG utility in the study of psychiatric patients by means of a prospective, blinded study, searching for specific signs of physiopathology in individual patients."}, {"Title": "Multimedia reviews: multimedia convergence for clinicians.", "Abstract": "Introduction by the column editor: In this final column of the year, Dr. Taintor provides an overview of exciting technological developments via his report on the 2003 annual meeting of the American Association for Technology in Psychiatry (AATP).

The amygdala plays important roles in modulating vigilance and generating negative emotional states and is often abnormally reactive in disorders of mood and emotion. The aim of this study was to assess amygdala reactivity in BPD patients relative to normal control subjects. We hypothesized that amygdala hyperreactivity contributes to hypervigilance, emotional dysregulation, and disturbed interpersonal relations in BPD.\nUsing functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined neural responses to 20-sec blocks of neutral, happy, sad, and fearful facial expression (or a fixation point) in 15 BPD and 15 normal control subjects. The DSM IV-diagnosed BPD patients and the normal control subjects were assessed by a clinical research team in a medical school psychiatry department.\nBorderline patients showed significantly greater left amygdala activation to the facial expressions of emotion (vs. a fixation point) compared with normal control subjects. Post-scan debriefing revealed that some borderline patients had difficulty disambiguating neutral faces or found them threatening.\nPictures of human emotional expressions elicit robust differences in amygdala activation levels in borderline patients, compared with normal control subjects, and can be used as probes to study the neuropathophysiologic basis of borderline personality disorder."}, {"Title": "Serotonin receptors: their key role in drugs to treat schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT)-receptor-based mechanisms have been postulated to play a critical role in the action of the new generation of antipsychotic drugs (APDs) that are usually referred to as atypical APDs because of their ability to achieve an antipsychotic effect with lower rates of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) compared to first-generation APDs such as haloperidol. Specifically, it has been proposed by Meltzer et al. [J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 251 (1989) 238] that potent 5-HT2A receptor antagonism together with weak dopamine (DA) D2 receptor antagonism are the principal pharmacologic features that differentiate clozapine and other apparent atypical APDs from first-generation typical APD. This hypothesis is consistent with the atypical features of quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone, which are the most common treatments for schizophrenia in the United States and many other countries, as well as a large number of compounds in various stages of development. Subsequent research showed that 5-HT1A agonism may be an important consequence of 5-HT2A antagonism and that substitution of 5-HT1A agonism for 5-HT2A antagonism may also produce an atypical APD drug when coupled with weak D2 antagonism. Aripiprazole, the most recently introduced atypical APD, and a D2 receptor partial agonist, may also owe some of its atypical properties to its net effect of weak D2 antagonism, 5-HT2A antagonism and 5-HT1A agonism [Eur. J. Pharmacol. 441 (2002) 137]. By contrast, the alternative \"fast-off\" hypothesis of Kapur and Seeman [Am. J. Psychiatry 158 (2001) 360] applies only to clozapine and quetiapine and is inconsistent with the \"slow\" off rate of most atypical APDs, including olanzapine, risperidone and ziprasidone. 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptors located on glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in the cortex and hippocampus, 5-HT2A receptors on the cell bodies of DA neurons in the ventral tegmentum and substantia nigra and GABAergic interneurons in the cortex and hippocampus, and 5-HT1A receptors in the raphe nuclei are likely to be important sites of action of the atypical APDs. At the same time, evidence has accumulated for the important modulatory role of 5-HT2C and 5-HT6 receptors for some of the effects of some of the current APDs. Thus, 5-HT has joined DA as a critical target for developing effective APDs and led to the search for novel drugs with complex pharmacology, ending the exclusive search for single-receptor targets, e.g., the D3 or D4 receptor, and drugs that are selective for them."}, {"Title": "Interaction between discrete and rhythmic movements: reaction time and phase of discrete movement initiation during oscillatory movements.", "Abstract": "This study investigates a task in which discrete and rhythmic movements are combined in a single-joint elbow rotation. Previous studies reported a tendency for the EMG burst associated with the discrete movement to occur around the expected burst associated with the rhythmic movement (e.g., [Exp. Brain Res. 99 (1994) 325; J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry 40 (1977) 1129; Hum. Mov. Sci. 19 (2000) 627]). We document this interaction between discrete and rhythmic movements in different task variations and suggest a model consisting of rhythmic and discrete pattern generators that reproduces the major results. In the experiment, subjects performed single-joint elbow oscillatory movements (2 Hz). Upon a signal, they initiated a movement that consisted of a shift in the midpoint of the oscillation (MID), a shift in the amplitude of the oscillation (AMP), or a combination of both (MID + AMP). These shifting movements were performed either in a reaction time or in a self-paced fashion. The tendency for the EMG bursts associated with the discrete and rhythmic movements to synchronize was found similarly in all three tasks and instruction conditions, but the synchronization was most pronounced in the self-initiated discrete movement. Reaction time was increased for the combined task (MID + AMP), indicating higher control demands due to a combination of discrete and rhythmic components. This EMG burst synchronization was reproduced in a model based on a half-center oscillator with activation signals that produce either rhythmic or discrete activity. This activity was interpreted as torques driving a simple limb model. Summation of discrete and rhythmic activation signals of the pattern generators was sufficient to simulate the EMG burst synchronization. Further, simulation data reproduced the modulation of the reaction time as a function of the phase of the discrete movement."}, {"Title": "MRI correlates of pathology in parkinsonism: segmented inversion recovery ratio imaging (SIRRIM).", "Abstract": "The two commonest, clinically well-defined, forms of parkinsonism are idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Both involve, inter alia, pathological changes in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN(C)). In PD there is neuronal loss with associated Lewy body pathology and microglial activation. Three morphological features have been identified [Brain 114 (1991), 2283; Greenfield's Neuropathology 2 (1997), 289]. First, there is a gradient of pathological change such that the lateral segments are more affected than the medial. Second, there is thinning of the pigmented tissue, and third, there is a broadening of the overall structure in a dorsal-ventral direction, possibly caused by the migration of melanin-laden macrophages [Greenfield's Neuropathology 2 (1997), 289]. In contrast, PSP is characterized pathologically by intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles. There are two morphological features in the SN(C) [Brain 114 (1991), 2283]. First, the gradient of pathological change is in the opposite direction to that of PD (i.e., the medial segments are more affected than the lateral). Second, there is atrophy. Any technique sensitive to neuropathology should be capable of detecting these features. We have previously reported on a new approach to detecting signal change in the substantia nigra in PD. This makes use of a ratio of images acquired by two distinct inversion recovery sequences [J. Neurol, Neurosurg. Psychiatry 67 (1999), 815; Am. J. Neuroradiol. 21 (2000) 697]. The prior work suggests that the technique is sensitive to, but not necessarily specific for, PD. We present here a preliminary report on an extension of the work. This is a semiautomated segmentation analysis that enables the substantia nigra to be displayed as an isolated structure. The technique is now given the acronym SIRRIM (segmented inversion recovery ratio imaging). In contrast to our earlier work, it allows for a more accurate assessment of the gross abnormalities. We report typical SIRRIM images of the SN(C). Images are shown for three subjects: a normal control, a patient with PD, and a \"disease control\" (a patient with PSP). In these examples all three morphological features of PD, as well as both morphological features of PSP, have radiological correlates. These preliminary findings suggest that SIRRIM may be specific for both diseases."}, {"Title": "IACM 2nd Conference on Cannabinoids in Medicine.", "Abstract": "The International Association for Cannabis as Medicine 2nd Conference on Cannabinoids in Medicine focused on new clinical research with cannabis and single cannabinoids (Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, CT-3) and on animal research with possible therapeutic implications.

New basic research opens further areas of possible uses for modulators of the endogenous cannabinoid system, including osteoporosis, cancer and inflammation. A workshop on psychiatry focused on effects of cannabis use on onset, incidence and the course of schizophrenia.

Suggestions are given for shifts in medical education that will encourage relevant cultural paradigms to make their way into educational and clinical systems, which in turn should improve cultural competence in clinical psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Use of, effectiveness of, and attitudes regarding influenza vaccine among house staff.", "Abstract": "To determine influenza vaccination rates, vaccine effectiveness, and factors influencing vaccination decisions among house staff.\nCross-sectional survey.\nAll residents registered at the University of Toronto were surveyed after the 1999-2000 influenza season. Of the 1,159 questionnaires mailed, 670 (58%) could be evaluated.\nInfluenza-like illnesses were reported by 36% of house staff. The vaccination rate was 51% among respondents, being highest for community and occupational medicine and pediatric staff (77% and 75%) and lowest for psychiatry, surgery, and radiology staff (32%, 36%, and 36%). Vaccinees reported significantly fewer episodes of illness (42 vs 54 per 100 subjects; P = .03) and fewer days of illness (272 vs 374 per 100 subjects; P = .02); absenteeism was not different (63 vs 69 per 100 subjects; P = .69). Self-protection was the most common reason for vaccination. Vaccinees believed the vaccine was more effective than did non-vaccinees (P < .01). Non-vaccinees considered influenza-like symptoms the most important side effect of the vaccine. Busy schedules and inconvenience were the most common reasons for not getting vaccinated. Overall, 44% of house staff believed the influenza vaccine should be mandatory.\nInfluenza-like illness was common among house staff. They tended to work through their illnesses, potentially putting patients at risk. They were motivated mostly by self-protection and did report a benefit. Despite busy schedules and an unfounded fear of getting influenza symptoms from the vaccine, many thought the vaccine should be mandatory."}, {"Title": "First year of practice visits for the Rural Depression Anxiety Research and Treatment General Practice program.", "Abstract": "To describe the first 12 months activities of a key component of a General Practice Psychiatry program - the GP practice visit.\nQuestionnaire to evaluate effects on participating general practitioners practice.\nRural group general practices.\nThirty-two general practitioners in the Loddon Campaspe Southern Mallee region in Victoria.\nPractice visits involved a combination of each of three key activities: primary consultation, secondary consultation and/or case discussion and formal teaching.\nGeneral practitioners reported a variety of changes in their practice as a result of the visits.\nPractice visits appear to be a useful means of influencing GP's practice.

The implications of having developmental coordination disorder (DCD).", "Abstract": "Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is a common motor problem affecting--even in rather severe form--several percent of school age children. In the past, DCD has usually been called 'clumsy child syndrome' or 'non-cerebral-palsy motor-perception dysfunction'. This disorder is more common in boys than in girls and is very often associated with psychopathology, particularly with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders/ autistic-type problems. Conversely, children with ADHD and autism spectrum problems, particularly those given a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, have a very high rate of comorbid DCD. Psychiatrists appear to be unaware of this type of comorbidity in their young patients. Neurologists, on the other hand, usually pay little attention to the striking behavioral and emotional problems shown by so many of their 'clumsy' patients. A need exists for a much clearer focus on DCD-in child psychiatry and in child neurology-both in research and in clinical practice."}, {"Title": "[Reversible choreoathetosis associated with lithium intoxication].", "Abstract": "Several reports have been published in the literature of choreoathetosis associated with lithium intoxication, but little is known about choreoathetosis without concurrent antipsychotic treatment. We report a 65-year-old woman with lithium intoxication whose choreoathetosis completely recovered without sequela following decrease of her serum lithium level. She had been treated elsewhere for bipolar II disorder and also for hypertension, chronic hepatitis type C and diabetes mellitus. As she became hypomanic, lithium carbonate at 600 mg/day was commenced, which was increased to 1200 mg/day due to unfavorable therapeutic response. She began to manifest disorientation and abnormal involuntary movement and was therefore referred to our Department of Psychiatry. Her clinical symptoms at admission included consciousness disturbance with marked bilateral symmetrical slow-wave activity in her EEG and choreoathetosis was observed in her face and upper and lower extremities. Cerebellar symptoms were minimal with only mild ataxic gait and finger-to-nose test did not show dysmetria or intention tremor. Her serum lithium level was 3.52 mEq/L, which was clearly in the toxic range. She demonstrated no metabolic abnormalities including hyperglycemia, and was diagnosed with lithium intoxication and treated with water loading and mannitol for forced diuresis. On the 14th day after admission her consciousness disturbance and choreoathetosis resolved, but EEG abnormalities still persisted. On the 23rd day after admission, she was discharged with clinical remission and normal EEG background activity. Although she developed mild renal dysfunction, hemodialysis was not indicated. Hypersensitivity of dopamine receptor in the nigrostriatal pathways may contribute to choreoathetosis in association with the patient's vulnerability. Choreoathetosis can be a sign of lithium intoxication and prompt treatment is required following careful differential diagnosis."}, {"Title": "[Implementation of integrated mental health care in an urban district of Tokyo].", "Abstract": "Japan had a long history of long-term hospital care and is now trying to change it into community-based psychiatry.

The perinatal system for mothers and babies, which has evolved over the past 9 years at the Morioka Red Cross Hospital. I explained the case of a 25-year-old woman who had already been suffering from depression before her pregnancy, and the course of improvement she experienced under this support system. In particular, I have shown a means of support, which can be provided by the obstetrics staff and is available to patient and families without making them feel hesitant. We take care of childbirth, and after baby care has started, we encourage depressive mothers to visit the Psychiatric Department. As a result, depression is no longer problematic, and the mothers recover sufficiently to be able to take good care of their babies. Even now, we are keeping track of these mothers and babies, while working together with the public health centers in communities. In the future, we will place emphasis on the implementation of SCID and on the careful observations of mothers and especially, babies, under the room-in system.

This means the rebirth of W. Griesinger's concept in which the psychosis is the brain disease. We should say, the mental disorders are the brain disease. This movement is a new conservatism. The second characteristics are widening of concept \"mental disorder\". The personality disorder is new category which is different from the classical concept of psychopathy. Now all psychiatric professors in Japan have recognize the concept \"borderline personality disorder\". This means that the psychiatrist has taken over the responsibility about the psychosocial problems from which they had kept themselves away in their clinical practices. The third is that the generalized anxiety disorder and the social anxiety disorder have been included in the DSM diagnosis. These are the borderland concept between the healthy and pathological condition which has been thought to belong to the mental health area. These have given us, the psychiatrist, the opportunity to think again on what the mental soundness really is."}, {"Title": "[Change in body image of patients with alcohol dependence during treatment process].", "Abstract": "In order to find useful information for the establishment of new treatment method to alcohol dependence, we investigated the change of the body image of patients with alcohol dependence before and after the treatment.

Patients with poor outcome of the treatment showed improvement of body image on visceral function, feeling of appetite and outward appearance, while patients with good outcome indicated no significant change in these aspects. This finding likely suggests that the treatment would result in good outcome in patients having stable feeling of physical health, and the cognitive treatment approach about these aspects of body image should be performed on the patients with poor treatment outcome. On the other hand, the body image about motor function showed significantly higher score in the patients approach for the patients with poor outcome to become aware of their physical activity would be effective."}, {"Title": "[Angewandte psychosomatik am beispiel des psychosomatischen konsiliar-/liaison-dienstes.].", "Abstract": "The discussion around the integration of a psycho-social approach in medicine concerning \"patient-centred medical care\" has gained increasing importance in the last few years especially at medical conferences and in text books. This importance has not been mirrored, however, in the daily life of hospital patients. A well-proven model of co-operation between psychiatric/ psychosomatic departments and other medical departments are the so-called consiliar/ liaison services. These have been developed in psychiatry and represent an especially close type of co-operation going beyond the classical and generally known counselling model. The following article gives a general overview of this form of co-operation with special consideration given to the situation in Austria. Questions concerning fields of duty, needs and the efficiency of C/L services are elaborated in the selection of areas of special emphasis.

A second objective was to determine if depression, anger and alcohol abuse mediated between PTSD symptoms and family functioning.\nVietnam veterans and their partners completed a series of questionnaires as part of their participation in the inpatient and outpatient PTSD treatment program, in the Veterans Psychiatry Unit, at the Austin and Repatriation Hospital.\nData from 270 veterans and partners were used in the final analyses. The PTSD subscales were initially correlated with family functioning for veterans and family functioning for partners. Then two path diagrams were constructed and analyzed using the statistical program AMOS to test for mediating effects between PTSD symptoms and family functioning. For veterans there were significant initial correlations with all three subscales of the PTSD measure. In the path analysis when the mediating variables were included only the avoidance subscale of the PTSD measure remained directly associated with family functioning. The arousal PTSD subscale was mediated by anger. The measures of depression and anger were significantly associated with poor family functioning and the anger and the avoidance subscales were significantly associated with depression. In the second set of analyses conducted on data from partners, the PTSD symptoms of avoidance and arousal were initially correlated with family functioning. When the test for mediation was conducted none of the PTSD subscales remained associated with partners' self-report of family functioning. Posttraumatic stress disorder arousal and alcohol abuse were mediated by anger for partners' self-report of family functioning.\nPosttraumatic stress disorder symptoms of avoidance for veterans, and comorbid symptoms of anger and depression for veterans, and anger on its own for partners appear to be important in the self-report of family functioning. These findings suggest that veterans and their partners have similar difficulties as couples with distressed relationships in the community."}, {"Title": "Mental health service delivery to older people in New South Wales: perceptions of aged care, adult mental health and mental health services for older people.", "Abstract": "To compare the perceptions of aged care services, adult mental health services and mental health services for older people regarding aspects of mental health service delivery for older people in New South Wales, Australia.\nThe NSW Branch of the Faculty of Psychiatry of Old Age in association with the NSW Centre for Mental Health, sent a postal survey to all aged care services, adult mental health services and mental health services for older people in NSW. The survey canvassed issues ranging across service profiles, regional variations, availability of resources, processes of care, views on working relationships between services, difficulties and gaps experienced, and ways to improve co-ordination and service delivery. Clinical issues such as the management and practice of psychiatric disorders of old age, educational/training requirements and skill and experience in working with older people were explored.\nAn overall response rate of 86% was achieved, including 95% from aged care services (n = 58), 74% from adult mental health services (n = 62) and 90% from mental health services for older people (n = 20). Only 59% of aged care services and adult mental health services considered that their local mental health services for older people provided an adequate service; resource and budget limitations were portrayed as the main constraint. Mental health services for older people varied widely in structure, settings and activities undertaken. Access to mental health beds for older people was also variable, and alongside staffing levels was considered problematic. Lack of staff training and/or inexperience in psychogeriatrics posed a challenge for aged care services and adult mental health services.\nRelationships between aged care services, adult mental health services and mental health services for older people are affected by lack of access to psychogeriatric staff, resource limitations of mental health services for older people, and inadequate liaison and support between the service types.

The influence of this tradition brings with it the risk of an understanding and treatment of mental illness which leaves out issues at the core of humanity. I suggest we need to recover something of the manner of thinking of the great figures in psychological thought who were writing before the rise of behaviourism and who were contributing to the origins of dynamic psychiatry.

Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is more effective and more cost-effective than medication. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors are equal in efficacy and both are to be preferred to benzodiazepines. Treatment choice depends on the skill of the clinician and the patient's circumstances. Drug treatment should be complemented by behaviour therapy. If the response to an adequate trial of a first-line treatment is poor, another evidence-based treatment should be used. A second opinion can be useful.

Even so, detailed research addressing the use of many of these products in specific populations has yet to be undertaken.\nTo investigate CM usage among patients treated in an Australian psychiatry unit and to assess fundamental attitudes and beliefs regarding CM in this cohort.\nFifty-two patients were recruited from the department of psychiatry of an Australian teaching hospital. Forty-eight subjects were men, 4 were women, and the mean +/- SD age of subjects was 56.7 +/- 9.1 years. Structured interviews were conducted to obtain details of the extent of CM use, usage patterns, reasons for use, and general perceptions about CM. The questionnaire also elicited information about the subjects' past medical and psychiatric history, prescribed medication, and substance use. Satisfaction with conventional drugs and CMs was measured using visual analog scales. Responses to a series of structured statements were used to assess attitudes and beliefs about complementary therapies.\nEighty-five CM treatments had been used by 27 (51.9%) subjects during the preceding 6 months, and 18 subjects were current CM users (44 items). The most common products taken were vitamins and minerals (n = 18) and herbal medicines (n = 14). Use of CM products was not related to demographic or medical factors, but was significantly less frequent among patients seeing their local physician >1 time per month. Only 17 of the respondents using CMs (63.0%) informed their physician about these therapies. Daily users of CMs ranked their satisfaction level with these products significantly higher (mean satisfaction score 79.0 +/- 21.9) than with conventional therapies (62.9 +/- 26.8). The attitude toward CMs was positive overall, and was slightly more favorable among users than nonusers.\nThis survey provides insight into the nature of CM usage in an Australian population of psychiatry patients.

This study examined the replicability of differences in clinical symptoms, neurocognitive functioning, affect perception, and social functioning previously reported among deficit (n=15) and nondeficit syndrome (n=30) schizophrenia patients classified according to the Schedule for the Deficit Syndrome (SDS; Psychiatry Res. 30 (1989) 119) and nonpatient controls (n=41). Additionally, participants completed self-report affective trait measures of positive affectivity, negative affectivity, and social anhedonia to examine the deficit syndrome concept of diminished emotional range. We were able to replicate symptom profiles and neurocognitive and social functioning impairments in deficit vs. nondeficit patients, but did not find more severe affect perception impairment in deficit vs. nondeficit patients as previously reported. Regarding range of subjectively experienced emotion, deficit patients reported lower trait positive affectivity and marginally higher social anhedonia than nondeficit patients and controls, but also reported elevations in negative affectivity that were similar to nondeficit patients as compared to controls. While replication of patterns of impairment across multiple domains of functioning supports the validity of the deficit syndrome, results also suggest that SDS-defined deficit patients may be characterized by a relative reduction in the tendency or ability to experience positive emotions, rather than a pervasive diminution in the range of emotional experience."}, {"Title": "Clinical importance of nightmare disorder in patients with dissociative disorders.", "Abstract": "In the present study the prevalence of nightmare disorder (ND) was examined in patients with dissociative disorders (DD), and comparison was made between those with ND and those without nightmares in terms of clinical characteristics.

Training is largely limited to child mental health specialists; general psychiatrists, pediatricians, and other primary care physicians receive little or no training. As a result, treatment patterns may reflect adult treatment plans that are not validated for youths. Effective treatments have been identified and some preliminary prevention models have been developed, but they are not yet widely applied.

In recent years, multiple uses for valproate have been found in psychiatry. As divalproex sodium, it is currently approved for the treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder and for migraine headache prophylaxis. Accumulating evidence suggests it may also be beneficial in several anxiety disorders. Valproate's pharmacokinetic profile has been extensively studied, mostly within the context of treatment of epilepsy. This review summarizes valproate's pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, and tolerability as an aid to promote individualized pharmacotherapy. Valproate is characterized by dose-limited absorption, nonlinear plasma protein binding, and multiple metabolic pathways of elimination. Pharmacokinetic drug interactions involving valproate result from its susceptibility to the effects of both enzyme induction and inhibition, along with an ability for weak to moderate inhibition of the metabolic elimination of other drugs. Valproate has an extensive record of use across the lifespan and a good record of tolerability. Some precautions are warranted in its use, but valproate is generally safe whether administered alone or in combination with other therapies."}, {"Title": "A chapter in emergency: a surgical trainee's experience.", "Abstract": "To assess (1) the exposure a senior house officer (SHO) gains while training in accident and emergency (A&E) and (2) how much this experience benefits a surgical trainee.\nAn SHO trained in A&E for a period of six months as part of his surgical rotation.

Combining both samples produced P=0.003, while LTalpha+A252G, located approximately 2-3 kb distally, revealed P=0.03 and the two locus haplotype yielded a P value of 0.001.\nOur data suggests association of the common G allele of the -G308A TNFalpha gene polymorphism with schizophrenia in a sample of 207 families. However, linkage disequilibrium with a different allele of the TNFalpha gene or another gene in the MHC region cannot be excluded."}, {"Title": "Cyclothymia, a circular mood disorder.", "Abstract": "Ewald Hecker (1843-1909) was a collaborator of Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum (1828-1899). Both worked outside the university and public mental institutions of Germany. By meticulously observing clinical signs and illness-course, they laid the groundwork for modern descriptive psychiatry. Their clinical approach influenced Kraepelin and continues to dominate psychiatric classification. Hecker popularized several of Kahlbaum's syndromal concepts, including hebephrenia. Another was cyclothymia, a relatively benigh form of manic-depressive illness, introduced by Kahlbaum, in 1882. It included depressive (dysthymia), hypomanic (hyperthymia), and mixed hypomanic-depressive phases. The Kahlbaum-Hecker syndrome of cyclothymia survives in DSM-IV bipolar II disorder and cyclothymia.

Their goals included integrating psychiatry into the mainstream of medicine, improving medical and social services to patients, improving the relationship between doctors and patients, and eliminating patients' social isolation.

This cross sectional study involves face-to-face interview with family caregivers of patients with dementia. Participants were recruited through convenient sampling from geriatric and psychiatry outpatient clinics from three government hospitals, one university hospital, one rural health centre and Alzheimer Disease caregivers' support groups. 70 caregivers took part in the study. Measures included patient and caregiver demographic variables and caregiver burden using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Caregiver burden was found to be significantly associated with both ethnicity and informal support. Chinese caregivers were found to have a higher level of burden compared to Indians and Malays. Informal support, in particular assistance from family members, was significantly associated with a lower burden perceived by the caregivers. However, the study shows that formal support such as assistance from maids and private nurses did not alleviate the burden of caregivers. Results highlighted the importance of improving the coping skills in burdened caregivers particularly among family members with dementia relatives. Interventions should be designed for specific needs of caregivers of different ethnicities."}, {"Title": "[Pica: a descriptive study of patients in a speciality medical center].", "Abstract": "According to the DSM IV, pica is a trouble of alimentary behavior, which is characterized by the ingestion of non-nutriment substances during at least on the month. The main objective of this study conducted at the Clermont-de-l'Oise Interdepartmental Medical Center is to evaluate pica's prevalence for hospitalized patients. Secondary objectives are to describe clinical characteristics, complications and outcome upon the different therapeutic approaches. The patients hospitalized in the Adult and/or Pediatric Department of Psychiatry, which fulfilled the 4 criteria of the DSM IV, were considered eligible for the study. In order to better evaluate the severity of behavioral troubles evoked by item D of DSM IV definition, we elaborated specific severity and preoccupation scales. The severity scale reflects the complications due to the ingestion of the non-nutriment substances, the encountered risks in the case of persistence of these troubles as well as the patient's management. The preoccupation scale reflects the medical team's involvement towards the patient in order to prevent life-threatening complications. The two scales are graded from 0 to 5 according to the severity or to the degree of preoccupation, respectively. Only patients with scores 3 were considered as fulfilling the severity criteria. Among the 943 hospitalized patients at a selected time period, 23 adult patients have been considered eligible. According to these data, prevalence of pica was estimated at 2.44%. This value may seem an underestimation when compared to the values reported in the medical literature, which range from 9 to 25%. Additionally, among the 108 hospitalized infant patients, none fulfilled DSM IV criteria, which is surprising, as pica is relatively common in childhood. These results may be explained by the use of the more restrictive criteria of the DSM IV and also by the difficulties encountered in considering pica as an independent medical condition. Indeed, pica is often a secondary diagnosis associated with other psychiatric conditions characterized by profound mental deterioration. Two pathogenic factors were constantly searched in the medical records: iron-deficiency anemia and psychopathology. Cultural factors can be a priori eliminated, as most of these patients are in rupture with their family environment since low ages. Only two patients presented with iron-deficiency anemia and its correction did not result in pica's improvement. These findings do not support the -studies presenting pica as an iron-deficiency anemia induced trouble, which regress after a well-conducted iron replacement. Most patients were found to have precocious lack of affect in their medical history. All patients presented other associated psychiatric troubles including severe mental impairment (48%) and dysharmonic development (26%), as well as autistic troubles and schizophrenia. These data concur with other studies, which associate pica to other psychiatric disorders. Gluttony is a widely represented symptom in our study population (87%) and predisposes to food aspiration. It is the mark of frenetic orality and concerns comestible as well as non-comestible compounds. The ingestion of non-nutriment compounds could therefore be considered as an incapacity of discerning among different mouth-introduced substances. Auto- and hetero-aggressive disorders have been reported in 77% of the patients. These behaviors arise mostly in the phase of seeking of substances, especially if these are particularly attractive. The enhancement of the -anxiety, which often arises in the eventuality of hindering of the act, as well as the soothing effect of the ingestion, suggests a compulsive activity. This compulsive activity could be related to an addictive conduct. Pica could therefore be related to obsessive-compulsive disorders and benefit from its specific therapy, either behavioral or chemotherapy with serotonin-recapture inhibitors. The most common clinical forms of pica were phytophagia and geophagia, probably due to the facility of access to these substances. However, 31 distinct substances have been identified in our study. Pica's evolution often implies severe complications, which are sometimes life threatening in spite of a well-conducted treatment. Severity factors include the iteration of medical and surgical complications, as well as the type of ingested products. Our results show a high incidence of surgical complications, essentially gastro-intestinal. Due to the elevated incidence of complications and to the high rate of mortality, some authors proposed systematical search of pica for any gastro-intestinal troubles arising in patients suffering from mental disorders. For these patients for whom anamnesis is often difficult, a standard X-ray of the abdomen is an essential imaging study. Respiratory complications come in second position and infectious complications are seen mostly for the geo- and coprophagia-suffering patients, which contract intestinal parasitosis. Because of its multifactor causality, treatment of pica is complex, and results are often deceiving. Symptomatic neuroleptic therapy results in transient improvement and is indicated especially in delirious patients. Psychotherapy with behavioral approaches and different institutional approaches can be proposed. Indeed, pica could be considered as an acquired behavior, which could benefit from cognitive and behavioral therapies. Institutional management including supportive and compassionate care, restoration of self-confidence is interesting for these patients. Some authors even suggest that pica might be considered as a good indicator of the institution's care quality."}, {"Title": "Involuntary medication in psychiatric inpatient treatment.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine involuntary medication in psychiatric inpatient treatment. A retrospective chart review of 1543 consecutive admissions of working aged civil patients from well-defined catchment areas to three psychiatric centres were evaluated regarding events of involuntary medication. 8.2% of the admissions included involuntary medication episode(s). Involuntary medication was associated with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, involuntary legal status and having previously been committed. One of the studied centres used less involuntary medication than the other two, even if patients with schizophrenia were over-represented in that centre. Although involuntary medication mainly takes places in the treatment of patients who are conceptualised most ill and perhaps resist treatment most, treatment culture obviously also plays a role. In future, it is important to study the aspects of treatment culture to fully understand the use of involuntary medication in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Delusion formation and insight in the context of affective disturbance.", "Abstract": "Delusions and lack of insight have traditionally been viewed as the defining characteristics of insanity and in modern psychiatry continue to be central to the diagnosis of psychosis. Little is known about the mechanisms of delusion formation and much of the research into delusions and lack of insight has been focussed on schizophrenia, in spite of the fact that these symptoms are also prominent in other disorders e.g., affective psychosis. The objective of this paper is to review the literature on existing theories of delusions and insight with reference to the effects of affective disturbance on memory processes.\nNarrative review supplemented by literature searches using Medline, PsycINFO and EMBASE databases for the period 1980 to present using terms \"delusion\", and \"insight\" and \"affect\".\nThe role of affect on memory in normal psychology and delusions in psychopathology is being increasingly recognised. We sketch out a theory which gives weight to locating the formation and maintenance of mood congruent and mood incongruent delusional beliefs (and insight into such beliefs) within a model of normal memory processes.\nWe conclude that delusional beliefs may represent false or biased memories of internal or external events modified and strengthened of by affective states. We propose that insight rests on an ability to identify these memories as internally generated or biased. In view of the growing body of knowledge accumulating from the study of memory, emotion and their neuropsychological correlates we would suggest using this as an evidence base for the further neuropsychiatric investigation of delusional beliefs."}, {"Title": "Borderline personality and psychotropic medication prescription in an outpatient psychiatry clinic.", "Abstract": "Borderline personality is a complex disorder and pharmacological intervention is typically focused on target symptoms. Previous studies indicate that patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are prescribed a greater number of psychotropic medications than those without BPD. However, these studies were self-report in design and/or preceded the use of newer psychotropic medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In this study, we explored among 280 psychiatric outpatients the relationships between an axis II diagnosis of BPD and the number of axis I diagnoses, psychotropic medications, and psychotherapy sessions. Compared to those with other types of personality disorders (n=128) or no personality disorder at all (n=91), those with BPD (n=61) were diagnosed with significantly more axis I disorders, prescribed significantly more psychotropic medications, and attended significantly more psychotherapy sessions. These findings suggest that: (1) BPD patients will probably be prescribed more psychotropic medications than other psychiatric outpatients, and (2) in addition to psychotropic medication prescription, there may be additional variables (e.g., psychotherapy sessions) that make a meaningful contribution to the overall healthcare utilization among those with BPD."}, {"Title": "Fibromyalgia: symptom constellation and potential therapeutic options.", "Abstract": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a disease entity consisting of a heterogeneous cluster of symptoms that has thus far eluded identification of a causative etiology. The disease onset appears to follow physiological and/or psychological stressors and involves a subset of symptoms that are consistent with varied disorders found in multiple medical specialties to include rheumatology, immunology, endocrinology, neurology, and psychiatry. Owing to the heterogeneity of the symptom complex and the heretofore absence of serum markers that might serve as concrete diagnostic criteria, this disease has baffled clinicians and basic scientists alike. Recent findings regarding sleep architecture, immunology, and endocrinology have provided clues that may help in the understanding and resultant treatment of this entity. Women with fibromyalgia tend to present with an alpha-delta sleep anomaly, which when treated with a growth hormone secretagogue (GHS), reduces the rheumatological pain and restores slow-wave sleep architecture. These findings suggest the somatotrophic axis may be involved in the etiology and the treatment of this disorder. Those diagnosed with FM respond to various stressors with increased disruption of their physiological homeostasis. When compared to healthy age-matched cohorts, there are quantitative differences in various neuroactive steroid levels, immunological markers, and feedback mechanisms. The varied physiological alterations in patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia when compared to controls will be discussed along with the potential treatment options for this population."}, {"Title": "Differences and similarities in insular and temporal pole MRI gray matter volume abnormalities in first-episode schizophrenia and affective psychosis.", "Abstract": "Whether psychoses associated with schizophrenia and affective disorder represent manifestations of different disorders or the same disorder is an important but unresolved question in psychiatry.

Little is known, however, about ethically relevant attitudes of psychiatrists toward human research. Working as part of a larger study, we surveyed all psychiatry faculty and residents at one institution in 1999 regarding the relative importance of 12 elements in the ethical conduct of human research. Responses of 73 participants were analyzed, and three factors emerged: Safeguards and Scientific Merit, Investigator Integrity and Relationship, and Patient Benefit. Safeguards and Scientific Merit, as a set, were the most salient considerations for both psychiatry faculty and residents. We found that residents placed greater importance on all factors and nearly every element than did faculty. Future research is needed to clarify the understanding of the perspectives and priorities of different stakeholders involved in human studies."}, {"Title": "Schizophrenia, consciousness, and the self.", "Abstract": "In recent years, there has been much focus on the apparent heterogeneity of schizophrenic symptoms. By contrast, this article proposes a unifying account emphasizing basic abnormalities of consciousness that underlie and also antecede a disparate assortment of signs and symptoms. Schizophrenia, we argue, is fundamentally a self-disorder or ipseity disturbance (ipse is Latin for \"self\" or \"itself\") that is characterized by complementary distortions of the act of awareness: hyperreflexivity and diminished self-affection. Hyperreflexivity refers to forms of exaggerated self-consciousness in which aspects of oneself are experienced as akin to external objects. Diminished self-affection or self-presence refers to a weakened sense of existing as a vital and self-coinciding source of awareness and action. This article integrates recent psychiatric research and European phenomenological psychiatry with some current work in cognitive science and phenomenological philosophy. After introducing the phenomenological approach along with a theoretical account of normal consciousness and self-awareness, we turn to a variety of schizophrenic syndromes. We examine positive, then negative, and finally disorganization symptoms-attempting in each case to illuminate shared distortions of consciousness and the sense of self. We conclude by discussing the possible relevance of this approach for identifying early schizophrenic symptoms."}, {"Title": "A stubborn behaviour: the failure of antidepressants to reduce suicide rates.", "Abstract": "Over the past decades the rate of completed suicide has remained quite stable, that of suicide attempts even seems to have increased (to the extent it has been studied in defined regions). These are puzzling observations, since depression is the major suicide precursor and since antidepressants over the years have been increasingly used in the treatment of depression. These observations have not attracted sufficient attention, possibly because they do not accord with consensus opinions about depression treatment in psychiatry today. In this paper a number of possible explanations are discussed. They not only deserve but are definitely in need of systematic investigation."}, {"Title": "[Spirituality and existential well-being as topics of research in medical psychology and psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Spirituality is introduced as a notion referring to a personal dimension of life sense donating self-reflection and includes religious thinking in this respect but, however, is by no means limited to religiousness. Different studies point out that there may be relevant connections between aspects of subjective life sense and variables like \"neuroticism\" and \"negative\" emotionality. In the Anglo-American psychological and even psychiatric literature this spiritual dimension is a topic of empirical research; programs of psychological treatment for chronical and terminal ill patients had been created and are mainly founded on aspects of spirituality as a relevant dimension in remaining life. Referring to the presented literature the hypothesis can be formed that a sense-donating contingency is related to different psychological and psychiatric topics not limited to aged people or those suffering from severe illness. Further research is needed; culture-dependent differences in the content and expression of spiritual dimensions may exist. The question becomes actualized by migration movements (fundamentalistic philosophies), a greater proportion of patients might be influenced by other religions and life sense-donating philosophies. In the existing psychotherapy literature indications are hardly found how these patients' characteristic features can be adequately integrated in design and execution of the psychotherapeutic process."}, {"Title": "An evidence-based medicine approach to combined treatment for ADHD in children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "Psychiatrists need to update their skills to incorporate advances in psychiatric practice and to do so \"at the bedside.\"To this end, evidence-based medicine (EBM), which is widely used as an educational heuristic in other areas medicine and has begun to make inroad in psychiatry training programs, provides practical methods to access, evaluate, and interpret the medical literature regarding disease causation, prognosis, diagnostic tests, and treatment strategies.With respect to treatment, EBM asserts the primacy of randomized, controlled trials for demonstrating efficacy, and, in some cases, the use of meta-analytic or systematic literature reviews conducted according to pre-specified criteria.

He was one of the few establishment figures to grapple with Freud's ideas in Italy during the first half of the twentieth century, a period during which Italy, compared to the rest of Europe and to the United States, was relatively impermeable to psychoanalysis. One of the factors that contributed to this was the opposition of the powerful Catholic Church, which identified in psychoanalysis a challenge to its authority. The author argues that Father Gemelli's shifting positions about psychoanalysis between 1925 and 1953 reflected the exigencies of his historical circumstances. Gemelli was able to identify in psychoanalysis an integrated view of the human condition in stark opposition to the brutal reductionism of psychiatry in Italy at that time, but also encountered in it elements intolerable to the Church. Examining specifically what it is that Gemelli could accept of psychoanalysis, and what needed to be rejected, between 1925 and 1953, illustrates the particular challenge posed by psychoanalysis to Catholicism in Italy."}, {"Title": "Signal transduction and genes-to-behaviors pathways in psychiatric diseases.", "Abstract": "Although psychiatric diseases are among the most common and destructive of all human illnesses, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying their complex origins remain to be elucidated. Dysfunction of critical intracellular signaling pathways is very likely to be involved. This conclusion is based on a number of observations, including the short- and long-term cellular effects of psychiatric drugs; the critical role signaling pathways play in neurotransmitter, neuropeptide, and neurohormone communication; and the fact that signaling pathways are principle regulators of the diverse array of behavioral symptoms experienced by patients. The genomics era has brought to psychiatry an abundance of genetic linkage and candidate gene findings. The difficult task--now under way--is to discern the functional relevance of these results. Recent evidence suggests the involvement of the ubiquitous protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin), a critical regulator of many signal transduction pathways, as a schizophrenia susceptibility gene. It is likely that genetic findings in severe psychiatric disorders will continue to implicate direct and indirect modulation of critical intracellular signaling pathways."}, {"Title": "Using pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in the treatment of psychiatric disorders: some ethical and economic considerations.", "Abstract": "Current pharmacotherapies for psychiatric disorders are generally incompletely effective. Many patients do not respond well or suffer adverse reactions to these drugs, which can result in poor patient compliance and poor treatment outcome. Adverse drug reactions and non-response are likely to be influenced by genetic polymorphisms. Pharmacogenetics holds some promise for improving the treatment of mood disorders by utilising information about genetic polymorphisms to match patients to the drug therapy that is the most effective with the fewest side effects. Pharmacogenomics promises to facilitate the development of new drugs for treatment. However, these technologies raise many ethical, economic and regulatory issues that need to be addressed before they can be integrated into psychiatry, and medicine more generally. We discuss ethical and policy issues arising from pharmacogenetic testing and pharmacogenomics research, such as informed consent, privacy and confidentiality, research on vulnerable persons and discrimination; and economic viability of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics.

I submit that at least some limitations resulted from an emphasis on what I would loosely call \"content\" and, related to it, on comprehensive \"formulations\" of a single literary character. This paper argues instead for a shift in focus onto \"process\" and situations created by particular interactions between the characters. Rather than pursue \"the psychology of the individual characters; what they are like, what makes them what they are, what intentions, often apparently not conscious, seem to motivate their actions and attitudes\" (Silberger 1973), I would look instead at what characters do (what they say, what they appear to emote and think) in response to each others' speech and imputed feelings and designs. The give-and-take entailed in the collision of their wishes, needs, and pasts at specific points in the evolution of the plot, and their reciprocal (mis)perceptions and (mis)interpretations, is especially relevant to understanding and teaching what is often thought to be the most complex aspect of being/becoming a psychiatrist, namely, comprehending and managing the emotional valences of the therapist-patient relationship.

Firstly, the \"Transtheoretical Model of Change\" by Prochaska and DiClemente, which defines motivation as a dynamic process with several stage dependent intervention possibilities. Secondly, the \"Motivational Interviewing\" technique by Miller and Rollnick, who strongly suggest an empathic communication style deriving from humanistic psychology. It has been shown that especially persons in early stages of substance related disorders profited very well from such early interventions. Psychiatric institutions not involved in specialized addiction treatment have to face frequent comorbid substance abuse among their patients. Findings of the efficacy of early interventions in general psychiatry are encouraging. Despite there is strong evidence of efficacy of early and motivational intervention strategies in several medical fields, their implementation tends to be very difficult."}, {"Title": "Mood and anxiety disorders associated with chronic pain: an examination in a nationally representative sample.", "Abstract": "Chronic pain and psychiatric disorders frequently co-occur. However, estimates of the magnitude of these associations have been biased by the use of select clinical samples. The present study utilized the National Comorbidity Survey [Arch. Gen.

Participants (N=5877) completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview [World Health Organization (1990)], a structured interview for trained non-clinician interviewers based on the revised third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [American Psychiatric Association (1987)], and provided self-reports of pain and disability associated with a variety of medical conditions. Significant positive associations were found between chronic pain and individual 12-month mood and anxiety disorders [odds ratios (OR) ranged from 1.92 to 4.27]. The strongest associations were observed with panic disorder (OR=4.27) and post-traumatic stress disorder (OR=3.69). The presence of one psychiatric disorder was not significantly associated with pain-related disability, but the presence of multiple psychiatric disorders was significantly associated with increased disability. The findings of the present study raise the possibility that improved efforts regarding the detection and treatment of anxiety disorders may be required in pain treatment settings."}, {"Title": "Chronic schizophrenics with positive symptomatology have shortened EEG microstate durations.", "Abstract": "In young, first-episode, never-treated schizophrenics compared with controls, (a) generally shorter durations of EEG microstates were reported (Koukkou et al., Brain Topogr 6 (1994) 251; Kinoshita et al., Psychiatry Res Neuroimaging 83 (1998) 58), and (b) specifically, shorter duration of a particular class of microstates (Koenig et al., Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci 249 (1999) 205).

The boundaries of various schools of psychiatric treatment are distinguished according to: (a) how much moral autonomy they accord the insane patient; and (b) whether they promote 'body' or 'mind' first (are 'somatopsychic' or 'psychosomatic'). I have also incorporated newly-discovered material that proves the existence of 'classical moral treatment', or therapeutic argumentation.\nThe paper outlines four distinct models of psychiatric treatment: 'classical moral treatment'; the 'pious fraud'; 'charismatic stewardship'; and 'moral treatment'. Neither the 'pious fraud' nor 'charismatic stewardship' allowed that the patient was morally autonomous--rather, lunatics were stereotyped as animals. After the 1780s, some psychiatrists began practising in ways that understood the patient as being capable of some rationality. But none of these practitioners saw 'moral' therapies to be independent of the body's workings--they used: (a) psychological methods to ease the administration of physic; and/or (b) psychological and medical remedies interchangeably. The Tukes, who developed the famous asylum 'The Retreat' at York, were the first to find successful ways to make psychological means predominate in therapy.\nThe Tukes of York are reinstalled in their position as founders of moral treatment as a therapy aimed at the autonomous human mind."}, {"Title": "Life events, difficulties and dilemmas in the onset of chronic fatigue syndrome: a case-control study.", "Abstract": "The role of stress in the onset of chronic fatigue syndrome is unclear.

Questionnaires concerning the state of propagation of Naikan therapy: comparison between 1984 and 2002 (1)\nI maintained that Naikan will be difficult to introduce unless it is known to and recognized by many researchers and therapists at the symposium titled \"How Naikan should be introduced\" in the 7th Conference of the Japanese Naikan Society in 1984 and carried out a questionnaire survey about how much knowledge about Naikan the respondents had, whether they had experienced Naikan or not, and whether they were willing to practice Naikan or not in April, 1984. This year, 18 years after the initial survey, I conducted a questionnaire survey with the same contents in similar subjects to evaluate whether Naikan had become more accepted and better known since the previous survey. (2)\nSince I thought that the attitudes of young assistant professors have the greatest effect on future trends of psychiatry, 80 assistant professors at psychiatric departments of medical schools of universities and medical colleges throughout Japan were selected as subjects. In the present survey, 80 professors were also included as subjects. Also, 3 hospitals were randomly selected in each prefecture from medium-sized private psychiatric hospitals with 200-300 beds, a size considered to be appropriate for practicing Naikan therapy, and the directors of the total of 141 hospitals were included in the subjects. II. RESULT AND SUMMARY (1) The response rate increased slightly in the assistant professors, more than doubled in the hospital directors, and was highest in the professors (67.5%). (2) Knowledge about Naikan therapy had scarcely spread among assistant professors since the previous survey. However, it markedly spread among hospital directors, and 37.6% of the hospital directors surveyed, a nearly 4-fold increase compared with the previous survey, were relatively well informed about Naikan. About half (46.4%) of the professors had considerable knowledge about Naikan. (3) Most of the assistant professors had little experience in the practice of Naikan therapy, but 28.9% of the hospital directors, more than double the percentage of the previous survey, had practiced or used Naikan. Few professors practiced it. (4) About whether the respondents are willing to practice Naikan in the future or not, a greater percentage of the assistant professors had no intention to practice it in the future, and the percentage of hospital directors who had no intention to practice it also increased while the percentage of those who wanted to practice it in the future increased simultaneously, showing polarization of the attitude. Of the professors, 53.7% hoped to practice it, but its realization was difficult due to the lack of cooperation by the staff and the restriction of time. (5) Factors that prevented spread of Naikan therapy were: [1] Young assistant professors were so preoccupied with their specialties that they took little interest in other fields, [2] research subjects of assistant professors are recently titled markedly to biological fields, [3] Naikan therapy is difficult to be accepted by young researchers because of the immaturity of its theorization, impreciseness of its indications, and the difficulty of evaluation of its therapeutic effects with the resultant ambiguity of the results, [4] it is difficult to gain support from hospital directors, because it is not covered by insurance policies so that its practice produces a large economic burden, because the place for its daily practice is difficult to secure, and because it requires a long time each day to both the patients and instructors. I hope that these factors that prevent propagation of Naikan are eliminated one by one and that it comes to be practiced worldwide to relieve many people of mental and physical ailments."}, {"Title": "Delirium in hospital: an underreported event at discharge.", "Abstract": "Delirium, an important event in hospital, is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Most patients with delirium recover fully; however, when left untreated, delirium may progress to stupor, coma, or death. Delirium is less likely to resolve completely in elderly patients in whom persistent cognitive deficits commonly occur. The extent to which this information is available to family doctors after discharge was investigated.\nA total of 31 patients with delirium who were referred to consultation-liaison psychiatry were assessed using standardized measures. Medical services completed discharge summaries on these patients; a chart review captured the extent to which the diagnosis of delirium and the involvement of psychiatry was recorded in the discharge summaries.\nIn structured discharge summaries, a reference to delirium occurrence was found in 55% of cases. In unstructured discharge summaries, the reporting was much lower (16% of cases). Delirium was more likely to be reported in women than in men, when it was more severe, or when it was the principal reason for admission, rather than when it occurred during an admission for some other reason.\nDelirium episodes that occur during a period of hospitalization for treatment of any medical disorder are underreported, even when specifically diagnosed.

Psychiatric institutions changed gradually - initially, the ill were placed and treated in an old medieval building, previously serving as a monastery, and in the final period, in a newly built complex originally intended for a psychiatric ward. Gradually,the specialization of psychiatrist was developed - it was to be a medical specialist dealing above all with mentally ill patients. The community of Cracovian psychiatrists contributed a lot to the development of specialist Polish terminology describing mental disorders. I have presented some important papers devoted to the aspects of psychiatry written by doctors directly dealing with the mentally ill and also by the doctors of different specialisations, mainly from the field of forensic medicine.

Their etiopathogenesis is similar as in other neurodevelopmental disorders and it was analyzed in the part dealing with biological specificities of persons with mental retardation. Numerous biopsycho-social factors cause increased vulnerability of the mentally retarded to development of mental disorders. Thus, prevalence of these disorders is higher in mentally retarded persons than in general population. This study also deals with specificities regarding diagnosis of psychotic disorders in mentally retarded persons as well as neurobiologic, epidemiologic, clinical and therapeutic characteristics of schizophrenic psychoses, autism and affective disorders in persons with mental retardation. Special emphasis was given to diagnostics of these disorders in mentally retarded children and adolescents, as well as to problems of differential diagnostics.

Little research, however, has been done to explore how relatives of people with schizophrenia perceive and experience stigmatization and how they can fight such stigmatization.\nAiming to explore stigma from the perspective of relatives of people with schizophrenia, focus group interviews were conducted with 122 members of advocacy groups from different parts of Germany. Focus group sessions were tape- and video-recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were coded using an inductive method, generating categories (domains) from the material.\nThe analysis of focus group data shows that, contrary to previous research findings, discrimination and disadvantages encountered by relatives of schizophrenia patients reach far beyond the spheres of direct social interaction and access to social roles. Our study revealed two additional domains in which relatives encounter stigmatization: structural discrimination and public images of mental illness. Furthermore, psychiatry has been identified as one important source of stigma. Relatives also suggested numerous anti-stigma interventions. These can be grouped into five main categories: communication measures, support for the ill and their relatives, changes in mental health care, education and training, and control and supervision.\nBased on our findings,ways of how relatives of schizophrenia patients and mental health professionals can fight against stigma are discussed."}, {"Title": "Brain reactivity to specific symptom provocation indicates prospective therapeutic outcome in OCD.", "Abstract": "A pertinent question in biological psychiatry is what differentiates responders and non-responders to pharmacological treatment. One possibility is that individual differences in the symptomatic spectrum as well as in the underlying biology of the disorder lead to the known 40% failure in pharmacological treatment. Our study aimed to maximize individual brain markers of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) by applying single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) during a provoked symptomatic state prior to and following treatment. Four brain SPECT scans were obtained from 26 OCD patients prior to and at 6 months of sertraline treatment. At each time point, two SPECT scans were performed in a counterbalanced order of two specific states; one a symptom-provoking condition and the other a relaxed condition. At 6 months of treatment, patients were divided into responders and non-responders according to a predetermined clinical criterion. Prospective responders showed significantly lower brain perfusion in the dorsal-caudal anterior cingulum and higher brain perfusion in the right caudate, when compared to non-responders, only during symptom provocation. When pre- and post-treatment scans during symptom provocation were compared, only responders showed significant change in brain response: increased perfusion in the left anterior temporal cortex and prefrontal cortex at 6 months' treatment. These findings suggest that obtaining functional brain imaging during specific symptom provocation emphasizes individual differences in brain reactivity. Thus can indicate prospective responders to symptom-related treatment in OCD and mark the relevant brain regions for effective response to treatment."}, {"Title": "[Requests from neuropathology to psychiatry: based on memoirs and prospect by a clinical neuropathologist].", "Abstract": "The subjects for neuropathology up to now, such as degenerative brain diseases, developmental impairments and dementia, should remain to be the one for general psychiatry in correlation with medical service and welfare.

Individuals aged between 45 and 54 are, however, likely to commit not offences but suicides comparing with other generations. One factor behind this phenomenon is the trend toward company downsizing, which is thought to affect the mental attitude of workers. This trend is destroying the Japanese lifetime employment system and undermining worker's loyalty to the company. On the other hand, in the broader category of felony crimes (assault, burglary, arson, murder), offenders aged 17 are the most common in Japan. This is thought to be partly due to the effect of so-called \"school collapse\" (school system failure) on the mental attitude of students. \"School collapse\" implies dysfunction of educational practice as a result of chattering, bullying and violence in the classroom. It is the reflection of students' dissatisfaction with the group-oriented school system. Therefore, students are unable to find any purposes in school and exhibit aggressive behaviours. In terms of mental health for both middle-age and teenage generations, it is necessary to devise new strategies whereby people can break away from the pressure of loyalty to the group. For both \"normal\" and \"disabled\" workers, rights of recuperations, adequate unemployment benefits policy, and support system for occupational change should be established. Simultaneously, for both \"normal\" and \"disabled\" students, reform of the school system under the concepts of diversity of education, rights of selection, and rights of refusal is urgently necessary. With respect to forensic psychiatry, without the provision of social supports, labeling of conduct disorder as well as other disorders should be avoided. In particular, instead of introducing security hospitals, drastic improvements of medical reformatories and medical prisons are necessary to provide adequate medical and social supports for offenders with psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatric symptoms related to interferon treatment for chronic hepatitis].", "Abstract": "Psychiatric symptoms related to interferon (IFN) treatment for chronic hepatitis have been a crucial issue in consultation liaison psychiatry. In this report we present a hypothesis regarding the development of psychiatric symptoms. There were marked differences in the incidence of psychiatric symptoms among studies. This may be because psychiatric symptoms are readily overlooked in routine practice in the Department of Internal Medicine, and because IFN treatment frequently causes transient depression. It was speculated that psychiatric intervention was required in 10-19% of the patients. We found that among psychiatric symptoms related to IFN treatment, depression with irritation and anxiety was commonly observed. In many case reports, mood disorder was noted as a precursory or residual symptom of delirium and hallucination/delusion. We present management guidelines for psychiatric symptoms in IFN treatment, and propose that self-assessment scaling should be performed before and during treatment to detect psychiatric symptoms in the early stage, and that patients with suspected symptoms should be promptly referred to the Department of Psychiatry. We introduce an open study of antidepressant treatment for depression related to IFN treatment, and recommend aggressive administration of antidepressants. IFN treatment should be discontinued in patients with: moderate or severe suicidal ideation or suicide attempt, depression that does not respond to antidepressant treatment, manic state, hallucination/delusion, or delirium."}, {"Title": "Psychoanalysis--a phenomenology of language.", "Abstract": "It is often said that there is an unbridgeable gap between phenomenology and psychoanalysis.

It is shown that this approach is possible on the field of language and semiotics where psychic life, as the essence of our subjectivity, may be rendered as a uniform phenomenon of an articulation in the world of signs. This thesis is elucidated at the end of the paper by discussing first (to the phenomenological side) a certain interpretation of the use of Husserl's reduction as a method of investigation in psychiatry and second (to the psychoanalytic side) the importance of Lacan's difference between repression and foreclosure for a psychopathological understanding of psychosis."}, {"Title": "[Current state and perspectives of forensic psychiatry in Poland].", "Abstract": "The paper is an attempt to describe the current state of affairs and perspectives in Polish forensic psychiatry in relation to the EU rules and standards on dealing with psychiatric patients who break the law.

The first step in the therapeutic process is to define the problem by addressing three issues: the target symptoms, the severity of those symptoms, and possible precipitants of the aggressive behavior. The next two steps are to select the goals of the intervention and to choose among three levels of immediate intervention, from least to most restrictive.

One of the early clues was provided in the 1950s by the author's observation of depressive symptoms in children and young adolescents with undescended testicles. This finding was extended to children with several chronic diseases, many of whom exhibited depressive symptoms as well. Eventually, depressive symptomatology was found in children without any physical disorders. This was followed by the introduction of a diagnostic instrument, called the Children's Affective Rating Scale (CARS), later converted into a more formal system called the Child Assessment Schedule (CAS). A provisional classification of childhood depression was published in 1972. Our examination of children with depressive disorders has revealed several modes of family interaction, of which the most important were: separation from important love objects; depreciation and rejection; and affective disorders in parents. Several children with bipolar disorder stimulated our interest in this disorder and led to a pilot study of children of bipolar, lithium-responding parents. Some of these children with bipolar illness had a clear-cut response to lithium and were strong augmenters of the average evoked potentials (EPs). Next, our group investigated the urinary excretion of norepinephrine and its metabolites in chronically depressed children who differed from a normal control group. The foregoing studies, along with major contributions by other child psychiatrists, eventually led to the acceptance of childhood depression as a clinical entity in US psychiatry.

This paper explores one manifestation of the impact on a psychiatry resident of a patient's suicide death: the activation of transference reactions and transference enactments on the part of both a resident and a residency training director. The author argues that the very breadth and depth of such transference responses offer invaluable opportunities for self-observation, psychological introspection, and personal growth if involved individuals have sufficient courage and supportive mechanisms for processing of the patient suicide and its aftermath. The failure of many current psychiatric trainees to undergo personal intensive psychotherapy is identified as a major obstacle to turning such potentially destructive experiences into learning and growth opportunities."}, {"Title": "When depression becomes terminal: the impact of patient suicide during residency.", "Abstract": "Patient suicide often results in profound personal and professional crises for the treating clinicians. Residency training in psychiatry represents a critical time for experiencing the death of patients by suicide. While residents often treat some of the most acutely ill, high-risk patients, during a uniquely vulnerable phase of professional development, many training programs do not have formalized procedures in place for aiding residents in the event of patient suicide. The working through of a suicide offers an opportunity for personal and professional growth. This paper examines this issue from the perspective of a resident-in-training who experienced the suicide of a long-term outpatient. Issues explored include personal and professional reactions to the patient's death as well as a discussion of the organizational response to the event."}, {"Title": "Terminal mental illness: resident experience of patient suicide.", "Abstract": "Suicide prevention efforts are a major focus of psychiatry residency training. Residents are taught to identify suicide risk factors, monitor for suicidal ideation, and develop crisis stabilization plans for patients at risk for self harm. In contrast, training and support for dealing with suicide completion is often lacking. Although suicide remains a predictable outcome for many patients with severe mental illness, this topic may be avoided or reviewed only with residents who are directly affected by patient suicide. The purpose of this paper is to present a psychiatry resident's experience of dealing with a patient suicide and identify obstacles to developing this aspect of training. Options for \"preventative\" training in helping trainees deal with this unfortunate outcome of mental illness will be reviewed."}, {"Title": "Trichotillomania: a review and case report.", "Abstract": "Although patients with trichotillomania typically present to dermatologists, the diagnosis and treatment lie in the field of psychiatry.

Its secretary, the prominent biologist Istv\u00e1n Ap\u00e1thy jr., defined the aims and the place of eugenics within the sanitation as well as the necessary steps of organization which should be taken in Hungary. It was especially some Hungarian psychiatrists: M\u00e1rk Goldberger, Lajos Nam\u00e9nyi, Gyula Don\u00e1th and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Benedek, the Hungarian Representative of the Committee of International Eugenical Organisations who after World War I urged eugenical law which envisaged voluntary sterilization. According to the opponents of eliminative eugenics--like K\u00e1roly Cs\u00f6rsz, one of the first distinguished medical geneticists in Hungary--sterilization had not been scientifically based yet, because the ways and the probability of heredity of nervous and mental diseases, except for Huntington chorea, had not been explored yet. The outstanding neurologist, Karl Schaffer also opposed the sterilization bill worked out by Professor Benedek, so it was rejected by the National Council of Public Health in 1932 and was not discussed by the Hungarian Parliament either. In spite of its illegality, some sterilizations were executed, for example with the consent and the request of parents in the case of mentally retarded female to stop her reproduction. Only positive eugenics was legally supported by the marriage advisory bureau in the capital, but the interest in it was rather limited in interwar Hungary."}, {"Title": "Induction of mania in depression by paroxetine.", "Abstract": "An investigation of the proportion of patients who have experienced mania with antidepressant treatment and their characteristics would seem to be of clinical use.\nThe purpose of this clinical study was to examine the predictors of induction of mania in depression patients as a result of paroxetine treatment.\nA retrospective cohort analysis was carried out among depression patients treated in the Department of Psychiatry, Kawasaki Medical School Hospital, Kurashiki, Japan, in 2000 and 2001. Some 79 patients were identified who were receiving paroxetine to treat depression. A variety of clinical factors including gender, the type of depression, frequency of episodes, family history, age and daily dose were examined as possible predictors of induction of mania by paroxetine.\nSeven (8.86%) of the 79 paroxetine-treated patients developed mania. A Cox proportional hazards analysis showed the type of depression and the history of family psychiatric illness to be independent predictive factors of the induction of mania by paroxetine treatment.\nThe rate of mania induction of paroxetine is not substantially different from that found for conventional antidepressants.

The objectives of this review were to determine the efficacy and safety of ECT based on both randomised and non-randomised evidence in elderly with a major depressive disorder.\nRandomised and non-randomised studies on efficacy and safety of ECT in elderly with and without concomitant disorders such as cerebrovascular disorders, Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia and Parkinson's disease were selected. Literature was systematically searched in a number of electronic databases.\nAlthough 121 studies were included in the review process, only four provided randomised evidence. No negative studies with respect to efficacy were found. ECT is effective in the acute treatment of late life depression. ECT is generally safe, although a number of serious complications possibly related to ECT have been described. Most of the objectives of this review could not be answered or refuted with certainty, because firm randomised evidence on the efficacy and safety of ECT in the depressed elderly is missing.\nECT is effective in the acute treatment of late life depression and is generally safe.

A comparison of old age psychiatry services in England and Northern Ireland.", "Abstract": "This paper seeks to address whether integrated structures are associated with more integrated forms of service. Northern Ireland has one of the most structurally integrated and comprehensive models of health and personal social services in Europe. Social and health services are jointly administered and this arrangement should, in theory, promote collaborative working and interdisciplinary arrangements.\nThe study employed a cross-sectional survey of consultants in old age psychiatry in England and Northern Ireland. Potential respondents were sourced from the UK Royal College of Psychiatrists membership list and locally collected information.\nA self-administered postal questionnaire. Along with general service arrangements, the domains measured reflect core policy issues for older people's services. Under particular scrutiny in this study were the degree of integration of health and social service provision, as well as inter-professional team working.\nThe integrated health and social care services in Northern Ireland do appear to provide more integrated patterns of working, primarily in managerial arrangements and in the location of staff. There was no evidence of the impact of integration on practice in areas such as: assessment, referral and medical screening. The factors found to be associated with greater integration of health and social care in the prediction model fell into three categories: provision of specialist services; provision of outreach activities; and shared policies by which the whole team worked.\nHealth and personal social services in Northern Ireland have a distinct advantage over their counterparts in comparable areas of England. The results indicate that integrated structures in old age psychiatry services are associated more with integrated management systems and less with integrated practice-related activities. Further research is required on the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of integrating services in general. It is important that future intervention studies systematically measure the component parts, nature and extent of integration and their individual and joint contribution to the effectiveness and efficacy of services."}, {"Title": "Brief intervention: reducing the repetition of deliberate self-harm.", "Abstract": "Deliberate self-poisoning is one of the commonest reasons for hospital admission in the UK and people who deliberately self-harm are often difficult to engage.

A sequential pronunciation priming task was administered to 30 schizophrenia patients with a flat affect expression, 30 schizophrenia patients suffering from anhedonia, 28 schizophrenia patients not suffering from anhedonia or flat affect, and 30 healthy subjects to assess affective and semantic priming effects. The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (Andreasen, British Journal of Psychiatry, 1989, 155, 53-58) was applied to evaluate the flat affect and anhedonia, and to categorize patients into groups. Schizophrenia patients did not differ from healthy subjects in affective and semantic priming scores. However, affective priming based on positive primes was inversely correlated with negative state and trait affectivity, and positively correlated with trait joy in the patient sample. These results support the view that a decrement in automatic processing facilitation of positive valence might play a role in the development of negative emotions. The symptoms of flat affect and anhedonia do not appear to be associated with impairments in the automatic processing of verbal emotional material in schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "[Planning and implementation of evaluation studies in child and adolescent psychiatry].", "Abstract": "An introduction into planning and implementing evaluation studies in child and adolescent psychiatry is presented. After the presentation of theoretical aspects of evaluation studies, the necessity of these studies is elucidated. Further, a conceptualisation of the dimensions of a treatment programme and some criteria for the selection of outcome criteria are offered. In addition to symptomatology, other criteria such as family functioning and quality of life are proposed in this context. Furthermore, it is recommended to ascertain data already at the time of the patient's registration. The influence of drop-out rate on the study result makes it necessary to closely consider any missing data.

Despite the fact that Brazilians have a high prevalence of exposure to traumatic events, such as accidents and homicides, there are few theoretical and empirical studies about PTSD in Brazil. This paper provides a brief review of the diagnosis of PTSD. Following a discussion of the main issues on the definition of traumatic event, we focused our discussion on the challenges of the psychiatric examination of patients with PTSD. In the last section of the paper, the authors emphasize the description of the PTSD symptoms and provide clinical vignettes to illustrate important psychopathological concepts. In conclusion, the importance of the diagnosis of PTSD in psychiatry is highlighted inasmuch as it provides an observational framework for investigating the effects of stress and trauma."}, {"Title": "Validity of the Swedish version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-Swe).", "Abstract": "The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is an internationally widely used, brief screening instrument for mental health problems in children and teenagers. The SDQ probes behaviours and psychological attributes reflecting the child's difficulties as well as strengths, and targets hyperactivity/inattention, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, peer problems and prosocial behaviour. Also, the instrument taps the impact aspect, i.e. whether the child is judged to suffer from emotional or behavioural problems severe enough to cause distress or social impairment. Studies of the original English SDQ, as well as of translations into several other languages, attest to a compelling usefulness and validity of the instrument. In this investigation, the adequacy of the Swedish adaptation of the SDQ (SDQ-Swe) was tested in comparisons between parent reports on 5-15-year-old children drawn from a community sample (n=263) and from a child psychiatric sample (n=230). Results showed that the instrument differentiated well between the community and the psychiatric samples, the latter displaying more symptoms, fewer strengths and more social impairment. Moreover, ROC analyses showed satisfactory sensitivity and specificity of the principal scales of the SDQ-Swe at proposed cut-offs. Hence, results showed adequate validity of the SDQ-Swe, suggesting that this new instrument, an instrument in tune with the ideas of contemporary child psychiatry and psychology, is a useful tool for mental health screening in children and adolescents."}, {"Title": "Defining thought broadcast.

One was the social pressure put upon Horn to publish detailed inside information about the hospital, which ironically was to build his reputation as a pioneering clinical psychiatrist. The other was the professional antagonism among the physicians involved in she scandal. The behaviour of J. C. Reil (1759-1813) in this affair stood in sharp contrast to that of J. G. Langermann (1768-1832) and C. W. Hufeland (1762-1836), who were in charge of the hospital's administration.

An historical interpretation has developed which traces the origins of \"modern\" psychodynamic medicine to the responses of nineteenth-century medical practitioners to railway spine. This interpretation characterizes the debates over railway spine as being between adherents of \"soma\" (i.e. constrained by \"traditional\" Victorian medical thought) and \"psyche\" (i.e. looking forward to \"modern\" psychological approaches). This article argues that this conflict is too sharply drawn and produces a teleologically-driven and misleading impression of the real significance of railway spine. This condition was seen from first to last as an organic disorder, and medical/medico-legal debates over its nature were concerned with the character of the organic processes at work, not with seeking to overturn organic explanations altogether. This has important consequences for historical understanding of the place of railway spine in the emergence of twentieth-century conceptions of traumatic disorder."}, {"Title": "Italian psychiatry - 25 years of change.", "Abstract": "Italian psychiatry is probably more debated than known in the international arena.

This practice has been reinforced by published criteria for CT scanning in psychiatric patients suggesting that cranial CT should be used as a screening tool to exclude intracranial pathology in all patients with a first presentation of schizophrenia or first psychotic episode.\nThis study reviews the performance of these criteria.\nThis consisted of a 3-year retrospective case-note audit, using published criteria, of all male in-patients with an established diagnosis of schizophrenia who had a cranial CT during the review period.\nThe efficacy of the published criteria is not supported. In addition, non-specific abnormalities on cranial CT are related to duration of illness and not age in this sample.\nThere is a need to establish new and clinically meaningful approaches for the use of cranial CT and similar technologies in clinical psychiatry.

(2001) Mol Psychiatry 6:657-664]. To further clarify this issue, the concentrations of extracellular DA, its deaminated metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and NA were compared by microdialysis in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an area densely innervated by NA and DA neurons, and in the occipital cortex (OCC), equally innervated by NA but receiving scarce DA projections. Moreover, the effect of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine locally perfused into the locus coeruleus (LC) on extracellular NA, DA, and DOPAC in the mPFC, OCC, and ventral striatum was investigated. Consistent with the homogeneous NA innervation, extracellular NA concentration was similar in both cortices, while extracellular DA in the OCC, in spite of the scarce DA afference in this area, was only 37% lower than in the mPFC; extracellular DOPAC in the OCC was 81% lower than in the mPFC. Consistent with its ability to inhibit NA neurons, clonidine (10 microM) reduced extracellular NA by about 65 and 80% in the OCC and the mPFC, respectively, but also reduced extracellular DA by 70 and 50% in the OCC and the mPFC, respectively. Clonidine reduced DOPAC in the OCC (by about 40%) but not in the mPFC. In the ventral striatum clonidine reduced NA (by 30%) but not DA and DOPAC. After inhibition of the DA and NA transporter, by perfusing 100 microM desmethyl-imipramine into the mPFC, clonidine perfusion into the LC reduced extracellular NA and DA in the mPFC by about 50%. The results indicate that most of extracellular DA in the OCC and a significant portion in the mPFC reflect the activity of NA neurons and support the hypothesis that extracellular DA in the cerebral cortex may originate not only from DA but also from NA neurons."}, {"Title": "Ambulatory internal medicine education: use of an urgent care center.", "Abstract": "Internal medicine residency programs have increased the time devoted to ambulatory medicine and the range of nonmedical areas in which expertise is expected.

We describe a model for teaching these skills based on a prolonged clinical interview.\nMedical students in their second clinical year interview new attenders at a public mental health clinic treating a range of neurotic and personality related disorders. Each student is assigned one patient whom he interviews independently at three weekly sessions lasting an hour. The students remain the sole therapeutic contact and are instructed to conduct an open interview with the purpose of maintaining therapeutic contact while gathering relevant information and assessing psychopathology. Supervision is conducted in a group session each week.\nIt is our impression that despite initial resistance, the students display a remarkable ability to conduct the prolonged interview in the form of a very brief therapeutic encounter. They show considerable appreciation of the basic issues involving transference and counter-transference. Over 20 years experience, there have been no reported adverse reactions in patients assessed in this process.\nThe supervised experience of an extended psychiatric interview, performed independently by medical students, facilitates the learning and acquisition of basic psychotherapeutic concepts and skills.

The largest group (39%) among the GPs thought that the main task of the visiting psychiatrist is to advise them on psycho-social issues, while leaving clinical responsibility in their hands. Less frequent responses included: diagnosis and treatment within the primary care clinic (17%), facilitating referrals (15%), and update teaching of psychiatry (12%). The predominant attitude was consistent with the finding that 96% of the GPs thought that they had good abilities at recognizing patients in distress, and 92% rated their doctor-patient relationship skills as high."}, {"Title": "[\"Acquired psychopathy\" and the neurobiology of emotion and violence].", "Abstract": "\"Psychopathy\" describes a type of personality disorder characterized by a dysregulation of emotion processing.

The model was one component of a larger, comprehensive women's health program at Yale funded by the Department of Health and Human Services between 1996 and 2000 under the National Centers of Excellence in Women's Health (CoE) designation. This article describes the structure and function of the model, its value to residents and the institution, and its limitations that led to its closure when Department of Health and Human Services support ended. The IWHC was designed as a consultation service that augmented the primary care provided to low-income, minority-group women in an established outpatient primary care setting. An interdisciplinary team of residents and faculty provided and coordinated a range of services for patients and participated in a weekly core curriculum. The model was an important resource to residents and provided high-level integrated care to patients. The combined educational experience helped refine a core interdisciplinary women's health curriculum. Despite these benefits, the IWHC could not be sustained outside the financial and programmatic structure of the larger CoE program. This experience suggests that longitudinal models where residents from different disciplines train in a shared educational and clinical setting may be more durable. Interdisciplinary models are effective ways to train residents and provide integrated care to women. The model's success depends on highly developed collaborative relationships between faculty, nonclinical sources of support, and long-term institutional commitment."}, {"Title": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in Mexico.", "Abstract": "Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is an uncommon but potentially fatal complication of antipsychotic and neuroleptic drug treatment.\nThis study estimated the frequency, clinical presentation, and outcome of NMS in a referral center for neurological, neurosurgical and psychiatric disorders in Mexico.\nThe authors conducted a thorough search of psychiatry, neurology, neurosurgery and intensive care unit records for cases of NMS during the 10-year period between 1990 and 1999.

Ideologically, Damerow was a representative until about the mid-nineteenth century of the holistic approach of medicine during the Romantic period, and he was largely influenced by the ideas of Hegel. He found justification for his service to the then ruling Prussian state in the concept of the state as manifestation of divine reason.

Further statements particularly relevant to psychiatry were: successful career, flexible working hours, manageable job, work-life balance, well-founded training, no bureaucracy within the company, and personal status in society.

Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while six patients with schizophrenia and six healthy control subjects spoke about seven Rorschach inkblots for 3 min each. Varying degrees of thought-disordered speech were elicited during each run. In a within-subject design, the degree of negative thought disorder, conceptualised as 'poverty of speech' (Liddle et al.

The degree of poverty of speech correlated positively mainly with activation in the right inferior parietal lobe (BA 40), middle frontal gyrus (BA 46), cuneus (BA 18), and the left posterior cingulate (BA 31). Negative correlations were evident in the left hippocampal/fusiform gyrus (BA 35/36/37).

The perception of dangerousness is closely associated with increased fear and anger, and decreased pity. One of the most notable differences between the two disorders is that while in the case of schizophrenia, labeling as mental illness primarily affects respondents' emotional reactions negatively, in the case of major depression a positive effect prevails. People with schizophrenia are, by far, more frequently considered as dangerous and unpredictable. They evoke more fear while people with major depression evoke more pro-social reactions.\nThe described similarities and differences of public beliefs and attitudes with regard to schizophrenia and major depression have important implications for the planning of anti-stigma programs and may help to develop more tailor-made interventions."}, {"Title": "Who benefits from cognitive behavioral therapy for vaginismus?", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of a group of Turkish vaginismus patients who benefited from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and to study which factors this treatment model changes.

Blatz bridged this gap by offering a number of advantages that could not be realized under the court's busy routine. Taking charge of a limited number of offenders permitted psychiatrists to more thoroughly examine special cases such as recidivists, intensely debate treatment strategies, more carefully supervise individual cases, and test their theories about the causes of juvenile crime. Conference case files reveal that psychiatrically informed strategies of regulation were a novel way to respond to deviance and that gender-specific understandings of, and strategies for, appropriate conduct also served to reproduce prevailing ideals for working-class boys and girls.

Not only psychiatrists but also specialists who qualify the patients for ECT--internal medicine specialists, neurologists and anaesthesiologists--treat the advanced age of a patient as a contraindication to ECT. It is also believed that ECT has adverse influence on the mental state of patients with the so-called psychoorganic syndrome. In most centres in Poland ECT is reserved for patients with drug-resistant depression and those in whom pharmacotherapy is contraindicated for any reason, such as pregnancy. Nevertheless the patients are carefully selected with respect to their physical condition. In many countries however the older the patient, the more likely he/she is to receive ECT as a method of choice. The effectiveness of this method in elderly patients is considered to be higher than in younger groups. ECT seems to be particularly effective in depression with psychotic symptoms and psychomotor retardation. The adverse effect of ECT on cognitive functions (learning and memory) which is a great concern of both doctors and patients, is actually noted in a small group of patients and usually transient. Moreover, the frequency of occurrence of this effect in elderly is not greater than in younger patients.\nWe have been encouraged to write this paper by very promising results achieved in patients treated with ECT in the Psychogeriatric Ward of the Ist Department of Psychiatry, Medical University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.\nAll 7 patients were diagnosed with severe depressive episode (in 4 cases with psychotic symptoms) in the course of either recurrent depression (6 cases) or bipolar disorder (1 case).\nIn all patients at least partial improvement was noted.

In this review the normal and abnormal development of the CC as well as its macro- and microscopic anatomy will be outlined. Then the detrimental effects of operative callosomy on different modalities, e. g. on vision, the somatosensory and the auditory system, will be discussed. Two electrophysiological methods will be introduced, with which interhemispheric communication can be studied: hemispheric transfer in rapid visuo-motoric tasks (CUD) and transcallosal inhibition (TI), a phenomenon which occurs in a special paradigm of transcranial magnetic stimulation. A first study found TI to be reduced in unmedicated schizophrenic patients. This suggests that an inhibition between motor cortices could be reduced in schizophrenic patients.

After establishing socio-demographic and psychological risk factors for depression, epidemiological research has focused on biological factors. This review summarises the evidence on the associations of cerebrovascular pathology, inflammation, and endocrine and nutritional status with depression in the elderly. The most consistent finding in biological psychiatry is the disturbance of the hypothalamic-pituary-adrenal axis in depressed persons. About half of the patients with severe depression have a disturbed glucocorticoid feedback mechanism and many exhibit hypercortisolism. Longitudinal studies show that this endocrine dysfunction increases the risk of relapse. More recently, silent brain infarcts and cerebral white matter lesions on MRI were found to be more frequent in the depressed elderly than in controls. Cerebral small vessel disease has been rediscovered as a potential cause of depression. Furthermore, there is evidence of immune activation in depressed persons. However, it remains unclear as to whether inflammation contributes to the pathological process as longitudinal studies are lacking. Clinical studies have also related many nutrients to psychological symptoms, but the evidence in elderly persons is consistent only for some vitamin deficiencies. In conclusion, despite a substantial body of literature on biological correlates of late life depression, little is known about causal relations.

It is now apparent that psychiatrists must follow treatment progress and outcome to assess and improve the quality of the care they provide. Most quality measurement and management programs to date have been carried out in research settings using process measures; however, it is clear that the focus must shift from research to practice and from process to outcome measurements. We discuss the notion of quality and outcome management and propose a model for selecting outcome measures. This model suggests 5 dimensions that are commonly assessed in outcome management. We successfully implemented a computerized documentation and quality measurement system in a psychiatric outpatient setting."}, {"Title": "The antisuicidal and mortality-reducing effect of lithium prophylaxis: consequences for guidelines in clinical psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The suicide-related mortality among patients with affective disorders is approximately 30 times higher, and overall mortality 2 to 3 times higher, than suicide-related mortality in the general population. Lithium has demonstrated possibly specific antisuicidal effects apart from its prophylactic efficacy: it significantly reduces the high excess mortality of patients with affective disorders. To date, suicide-prevention effects have not been shown for antidepressant or anticonvulsant long-term treatment. Clozapine appears to reduce the suicide rate in schizophrenia patients. Against this background, guidelines and algorithms for selecting an appropriate prophylactic strategy for affective disorders should consider the presence of suicidality in patient history. Appropriate lithium prophylaxis prevents approximately 250 suicides yearly in Germany, although lithium salts are infrequently prescribed within the National Health Scheme (specifically, to 0.06% of the population). Rational treatment strategies most likely would demand that prescription rates be about 10 times higher."}, {"Title": "[The third pillar of psychiatric health care reform].", "Abstract": "Coordination of all psychiatric services is essential for the successful implementation of community oriented services, particularly in a decentralised health system like the one in Germany.

At best, educators may be able to assure formative competencies, including mastery of core knowledge of the psychotherapies, actual undertaking of these psychotherapies, and adequate performance in selected elements of these psychotherapies.\nSince it is unrealistic to assume that training programs will ever be able to confirm summative competencies in these psychotherapies, we advise programs to define precisely the levels of formative competence they expect, and design curriculum and measures accordingly. Further, we urge the RRC to revise their requirements to address expectations more honestly, and to re-state the expected competencies more modestly. We believe that the RRC can expect programs to show that all residents can demonstrate knowledge about the evidence base, theories and rules of practice supporting at least the following forms of treatment: brief therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, combined psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, psychodynamic therapy, and supportive therapy.

Each program must decide what specific skills are essential for competence in each of the five listed psychotherapies. This requires determining whether those skills that are necessary are also sufficient for effective psychotherapy and whether additional specific skills are required for each one.\nTwo lists of general skills for psychotherapy are compared, one from the perspective of specific \"schools\" of psychotherapy and one from a more eclectic \"integrative\" approach. The issue of measuring competence is addressed by placing ratings of \"competent\" midway on a continuum from \"novice\" to \"expert.\" Thirteen methods for measuring competence from the Accreditation Council for Graduate medical Education (ACGME) \"tool-box\" are described and reviewed with respect to applicability to psychotherapy. Examples of toolbox implementation are described based on a functioning psychotherapy evaluation program at the University of Missouri.\nThe authors found both theoretical as well as practical problems in measuring competence in psychotherapy.

Three means were used to evaluate the assessment program: 1) The authors surveyed graduates and credentialing agencies for feedback on the relevance of the measures they previously developed for current and envisioned future practice of psychiatry; 2) They measured the completion rates of competency measures by residents in the first 3 years of a program, measuring general psychiatric competencies; and 3) They surveyed residents and faculty regarding satisfaction with the existing process.\nDespite small numbers, the results indicated that measures devised in 1998 were relevant to the practice of psychiatry in 2001 and envisioned by practitioners for the subsequent 5 to 10 years. Resident completion rates of competency requirements indicated that the structure of the measures was appropriately paced to parallel the learning expectations of the training program. Participant satisfaction with the process of developing and implementing the measures was high.\nWhile devising and implementing competency assessments is critical, the process should not stop with the application of the measures. Ongoing evaluation of these measures for their continued suitability is essential.

Diagnostic and therapeutic options for psychiatry and psychotherapy].", "Abstract": "Over the last few years, a shift in paradigm has taken place in the diagnosis and therapy of insomnia. Traditionally, treatment focused on improving night sleep, i.e. shortening sleep latency and prolonging total sleep time. Modern approaches aim at improving or restoring the recuperative value of sleep and ensuring daytime functioning on a social, psychological and professional level. Based on the guidelines \"Non-restorative Sleep\" of the German Society of Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine, this article presents a clinical algorithm for the diagnosis and therapy of non-restorative sleep with predominant insomnia. The term \"non-restorative sleep\" permits us to view the restorative value of sleep and the resulting daytime functioning of the individual afflicted with insomnia as the focus for the diagnosis of and therapy for insomnia. This algorithm is suitable for the clinical practice of outpatient psychiatric and psychotherapeutic services as well as for psychiatric inpatients. The main features for psychiatrists and psychotherapists in the diagnosis and therapy of non-restorative sleep are underlying psychiatric-psychological factors or secondary psychiatric sequelae of chronic primary insomnias. For primary, organic and psychiatric insomnias, a broad spectrum of psychopharmacological and cognitive behavioral methods can be applied either alone or in combination."}, {"Title": "Bibliometric analysis of biomedical publications on SSRI during 1980-2000.", "Abstract": "We performed a bibliometric study of the scientific publications referring to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

This shows that his seminal ideas grew out of his astute observation of psychiatric signs and symptoms. Later on, he observed the broad spectrum of human epileptic seizures and its cause in the limbic system. A large variety of uncontrolled feelings and emotions, together with bizarre motor behavior, is elicited by seizures in the hippocampus and other limbic structures.Meanwhile, based on the triune brain model, a new approach to psychopathology has taken shape. It is the evolutionary perspective of mental diseases such as the major psychoses, anorexia nervosa, anxiety disorders, and also brain diseases such as Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease. Many mental illnesses are marked by severe deficits in social behavior and social communication. The social communication system disintegrates, especially in the major psychoses. The response choices to social or other external signals in a given situation become limited or even distorted, and reasoning is no longer part of decision making. The emphasis of this contribution is on the disintegration of social behavior in psychopathology, based on evolutionary psychiatry.

His curiosity about the neurological origins of these psychological symptoms led him to the laboratories of Stanley Cobb and James Papez, both of whom were influential in guiding MacLean's interests toward the temporal lobe. His neurobiological interest was not contained, however, to the temporal lobe. As his own family grew to include a wife and five children, his scholarly pursuits extended to social and familial relations and their accompanying underlying neuroanatomical circuits (i.e. the thalamocingulate system). Viewing the brain and behavior from an evolutionary perspective, MacLean introduced the concept of the \"triune brain\" to describe the evolutionarily distinct components of the mammalian brain and reintroduced Broca's term \"limbic\" to describe a neuroanatomical system involved in emotional functions. MacLean wrote that the development of social behaviors, such as mother-infant audiovocal communication and the separation cry of the offspring, served as the driving force in the evolution of the neocortex.

The discovery that reserpine depletes brain monoamines was an important factor in the development of the monoamine hypothesis of depression, and it continues to be widely cited in support of this hypothesis. The present paper argues that, contrary to prevailing belief, reserpine is not depressogenic. The reason for perpetuation of this myth is reluctance to discard the monoamine hypothesis. This hypothesis ushered the modern biochemical paradigm into psychiatry and is still of great importance. It serves as a heuristic to guide research, it enhances psychiatry's prestige, and it helps to validate and promote drug therapy for depression and other mental disorders."}, {"Title": "What do we know about medication errors in inpatient psychiatry?", "Abstract": "Adverse drug events (ADEs) have been implicated as a cause of substantial morbidity and mortality.

The main aim of this paper is to identify and examine possible reasons for this neglect.\nA selective review of the general literature on somatoform disorders.\nSignificant conceptual, diagnostic and classificatory problems have impeded the consideration of somatoform disorders in older people. There is a perception that somatoform disorders are infrequent and have not been validated as independent clinical disorders. However, we present evidence that the more broadly defined somatoform disorders are common in all age groups in primary care and meet criteria for the determination of clinical validity. General difficulties in the assessment of psychiatric disorders in primary care, the setting in which somatoform disorders are most common, are compounded by a lack of support from old age psychiatry services. Effective psychological therapies may not be readily available to sufferers.\nThere is a need for change in the conceptualisation and nosology of the somatoform disorders. The formulation of age appropriate diagnostic criteria and presentations is a prerequisite for determining the clinical validity of these disorders in older people. This can be followed by study of their frequency, associated risk factors and treatment. A system of education that enhances the management of these disorders within primary care and old age psychiatry services is needed."}, {"Title": "A review of the modulation of the startle reflex by affective states and its application in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "To provide an overview of startle reflex methodologies applied to the examination of emotional and motivational states in humans and to review the findings in different forms of psychopathology.\nPertinent articles were searched mostly via MEDLINE and PsycINFO.\nThe startle reflex is a non-invasive translational tool of research that bridges the gap between animal and human investigations. Startle is used to study fear and anxiety, affective disturbances, sensitization, motivational states, and homeostasis.\nThe startle reflex is highly sensitive to various factors that are of interest in the studies of emotional disorders and has promoted new areas of investigations in psychiatry. However, research in psychiatry is still in its infancy and most findings await replication. Future progress will benefit from the development of innovative and powerful designs tailored to investigate specific disorders.\nThe startle reflex has utility as a research tool to examine trauma-related disorders, fear learning, drug addiction, and to contrast affective states and emotional processing across diagnostic groups, but its usefulness as a diagnostic tool is limited."}, {"Title": "Characteristics of the Detained and Informal Child and Adolescent Psychiatric In-Patient Populations.", "Abstract": "This project surveyed the use of the Children Act and the Mental Health Act in in-patient child and adolescent mental health services in England and Wales.\nData were collected as a day census from child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient units, questionnaire forms completed by consultant psychiatrists or key-workers.

He developed a lifelong passion for myrmecology in his childhood, but chose medicine and neuropsychiatry to earn his living. He first undertook a comparative study of the thalamus under Theodor Meynert in Vienna and then, from 1872 to 1879, he worked as Assistant Physician to Bernhard von Gudden in Munich. This led in 1877 to his seminal work on the organization of the tegmental region in which he provides the first description of the zona incerta and the so-called H (Haubenfeld) fields that still bear his name. In 1879, Forel was appointed Professor of Psychiatry in Munich and Director of the Burgh\u00f6lzli cantonal asylum. He became interested in the therapeutic value of hypnotism, while continuing his work on brain anatomy and ants. His neuroanatomical studies with Gudden's method led him to formulate the neuron theory in 1887, four years before Wilhelm von Waldeyer, who received most of the credit for it. Forel then definitively turned his back on neuroscience. After his retirement from the Burgh\u00f6lzli asylum in 1898. and despite a stroke in 1911 that left him hemiplegic, Forel started to write extensively on various social issues, such as alcohol abstinence and sexual problems. Before his death in 1931 at the age of 83, Forel published a remarkable book on the social world of the ants in which he made insightful observations on the neural control of sensory and instinctive behavior common to both humans and insects."}, {"Title": "Descartes' Passions of the soul--seeds of psychiatry?", "Abstract": "Rene Descartes (1596-1650), often called the 'father of modern philosophy', aimed at rooting all knowledge in certainty so that our understanding of the world could progress without error. To achieve this, he needed at least one sure thing on which to build. Starting with the most basic knowledge, the fact of his own existence--cogito ergo sum (I think therefore I am), he systematically proceeded to explain the world. Such systematic understanding would be accessible to anyone who applied the Cartesian method, and in turn would lead to a good life. Descartes' Passions of the Soul was written according to his method of certainty and fits in with a meticulously refined worldview. It is one of the first systematic treatises to explain a wide array of emotions, both normal and abnormal. Based on the Cartesian dualistic model of mind and body, the work helps ground a long medical tradition of separating 'rational' consciousness from emotions. For Descartes, emotions arose from two sources, the intellect and the body (Passions of the Soul and Passions of the Body). The more subtle 'Passions of the Soul' were viewed as superior to coarser and often-troublesome emotions taking root in the body. It is interesting to note the absence of clarity, however, in Descartes' division of intellectual emotions from bodily emotions, perhaps revealing an enduring weakness in the dualistic model itself. The work grapples with the multi-causal nature of psychopathology and brings out complex interactions between temperament and life experience. While modern neuroscience makes ever-tighter associations between physiology and experience, many of the basic scientific challenges we face today are outlined in this 350-year-old book."}, {"Title": "[Neurosyphilis in psychiatry: surprising underlying disorder in 3 patients].", "Abstract": "In 3 patients, two men aged 34 and 46 years and a woman aged 24 years, who appeared to have psychiatric disorders, neurosyphilis was diagnosed on the basis of screened blood tests. Treatment with intravenous benzylpenicillin alleviated the symptoms. In recent years the incidence of primary syphilis in the Netherlands has risen. There is a wide range of symptoms and the interpretation of serologic results is difficult, especially if there is co-infection with HIV; this disease also increases the chance of progression from primary syphilis to neurosyphilis. Patients admitted to clinical care are usually severely ill and are frequently uncooperative or present unclear histories. Detection at an early stage is vital, as adequate treatment prevents disease progression. This could be achieved by a general screening of clinical psychiatric patients for syphilis in addition to the screening of selected groups."}, {"Title": "The impact of anxiety disorders on educational achievement.", "Abstract": "Anxiety disorders typically have an age of onset in childhood and adolescence, resulting in significant disability in social and occupational functioning. Epidemiological evidence suggests that persons with psychiatric disorders and perhaps especially social phobia are at increased risk for premature withdrawal from school [Am. J. Psychiatry 157 (2000) 1606]. In order to further determine the impact of anxiety disorders on school functioning and/or premature withdrawal from school, 201 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for a primary anxiety disorder completed a school leaving questionnaire as well as self-report measures of anxiety, depression, and social adjustment. About 49% (n = 98) reported leaving school prematurely and 24% of those indicated that anxiety was the primary reason for this decision. Patients who had left school prematurely were significantly more likely to have a lifetime diagnosis of generalized social phobia, a past history of alcohol abuse/dependence and a greater number of lifetime diagnoses than those who completed their desired level of education. This study suggests that anxiety disorders, and perhaps especially generalized social phobia, are associated with premature withdrawal from school. Further studies are required to determine methods for early identification and treatment of anxiety disorders in school aged children to enable these students to reach their full potential."}, {"Title": "Asklepian dreams: the ethos of the wounded-healer in the clinical encounter.", "Abstract": "The clinical encounter is structured hierarchically: explicit technical action is embedded in levels of organization that reflect the personality and biography of the clinician, which in turn, are embedded in a larger matrix of cultural values or ethos. Systems of medicine can be compared at each of these levels. Shamanism and other elementary systems of medicine are built on an ethos that identifies healers' calling, authority and effectiveness with their own initiatory illness experiences. The Asklepian religious cults of ancient Greece also drew from the image of the wounded-healer. This essay argues that ethos of the wounded-healer remains relevant to contemporary medicine, psychiatry and psychotherapy. Developmental changes in the relationship of the healer to his wounds during psychiatric training are illustrated by a series of dreams. The ethos of the wounded-healer has implications for the training of clinicians, as well as for the ethics and pragmatics of clinical work."}, {"Title": "Jungians and the rise of psychotherapy in Japan: a brief historical note.", "Abstract": "Scholars of transcultural psychiatry have long wondered why psychoanalysis has remained marginal in Japan, despite its early introduction there. Psychotherapy, however, has been steadily growing in popularity, and Jungians have played no small part in this development. This article provides a brief historical sketch of psychotherapy in Japan by focusing on how Jungians have cultivated a following through imaginative cultural critiques and therapeutic practices such as sandplay therapy. The article also touches upon the particularly Jungian themes that have appealed to popular audiences, as well as the dilemmas psychotherapists have encountered in their attempts to institutionalize psychotherapy as a form of clinical practice in Japan."}, {"Title": "Jung, spirits and madness: lessons for cultural psychiatry.", "Abstract": "An understanding of the nature and meaning of 'dissociative,' 'altered' or unusual states ultimately turns on the meaning and definition of consciousness. The view of consciousness from the discipline of psychiatry is largely based on a biomedically endorsed, culturally specific perspective of 'normal' consciousness as an integrated pattern of quotidian relationships with the 'observable' physical world. This perspective underlies the nosology for mental disorders, particularly psychoses, suggesting irreconcilable difference in cognition and affect of persons with these diagnostic labels. This article reviews some theories of Carl Gustav Jung regarding the structure and content of human consciousness and their relationship to aspects of 'dementia praecox' or 'schizophrenia.' It traces the origin and development of these ideas in part to Jung's early contact with, and intense interest in spiritualists and spirits, to later influences comprised of his own altered states (dreams and fantasies) and his involvement with patients diagnosed as schizophrenic. Data on current Spiritist beliefs and healing practices focused on 'madness' (i.e. most often diagnosed as schizophrenia in mental health settings), are described to explore parallels with Jung's ideas on the structure and dynamics of the psyche. These parallels are of special interest because the experience of spirits is ubiquitous, not well explained and often rejected as meaningful by psychiatrists and clinical psychologists. Jung, however, offers a cogent explanation of spirit phenomena as manifestations of the unconscious. A concluding section suggests contributions to cultural psychiatry by Jung."}, {"Title": "[Deaths due to mechanical restraint in institutions for care].", "Abstract": "The state of confusion in patients with severe disorientation and brain damage symptoms presents particular problems in gerontologic psychiatry. Six fatalities at different institutions due to improperly employed physical restraint and deficient surveillance are described. The causes of death involved strangulation which was accidentally caused by patients who become stuck between bedrails and mattress or who were fixed in an abdominal restraint belt or in a special protective blanket (mostly used for serious pre-conditions). The reconstruction of the scene of death was based in almost all the cases on the autopsy findings. We assume a considerable number of unreported emergency or fatal cases. The legal, psychiatric and nursing-related issues are discussed in this paper. Furthermore the precise documentation of the on-site appearance of the situation at discovery of death is called for. The indication for physical restraint should be limited as far as possible. Further studies in nursing homes and hospitals should focus on structural conditions with respect to the frequency of physical restraint in order to optimize the protection by quality standards."}, {"Title": "Are therapeutic relationships in psychiatry explained by patients' symptoms?

In all the patients, the therapeutic relationship was assessed using a simple scale based on three items.\nThe therapeutic relationship differed significantly across groups. It was rated most positively by alcoholic patients and least positively by long-term hospitalised schizophrenia patients. Increased observer-rated psychopathology was significantly associated with a poorer therapeutic relationship in all groups except the hospitalised schizophrenia patients. In this group, increased self-rated symptoms were associated with a poorer relationship. In multiple regression analyses, 3-28% of the relationship variance was explained by psychopathology.

The word \"substitution\" participates to the uncertainty as to the objective of such treatments. From an addiction psychiatry perspective, these treatments are of interest as pharmacological treatments for maintenance of abstinence. In such a perspective they are not changing one substance of dependence for another. The goal is to reduce craving by low potential reinforcement medications. Conditions for success are a clarification of treatment goal with the patients, adequate dosing, and time. All medical doctors may prescribe buprenorphine for treatment of opiate dependence. Supervised daily dispensing in pharmacies is useful to increase compliance and collaboration, and avoid misuse and diversion. For tobacco dependence, nicotine patch must be clearly differentiated from other nicotine substitutes like gums and inhalers that have significant reinforcing effects. Because the patch is accessible without medical prescription, many patients are not sufficiently medically supervised and dropout frequently. For patients that cannot initially accept the behavioral changes associated to the goal of abstinence, it is legitimate to truly substitute them with less dangerous reinforcing substances. This possibility exists in France only for tobacco use that can be substituted to inhaled or chewed nicotine. It is possible that some reported misuse of buprenorphine and methadone are inadequate attempts to increase the reinforcing effects of these medications."}, {"Title": "Clinical and demographic profile of cancer patients in a consultation-liaison psychiatric service.", "Abstract": "An almost 50% prevalence of psychiatric disorders among cancer patients has prompted a series of studies on consultation-liaison psychiatry.

This tension cannot be resolved by way of the underpinning philosophies of these positions, namely empiricism and idealism. Instead, critical realism, positioned between these philosophies offers a methodology through which to seek a new paradigm.\nThis paper aims to determine whether psychiatric nursing has the potential to exist as an independent and autonomous profession, concerned with providing a helping response to those in mental distress.\nThe paper asks critical realism's transcendental question in order to identify the a priori requirements of an autonomous psychiatric nursing, independent of both psychiatry and psychology. Consideration of these a priori requirements includes selected information from contemporary texts in order to identify potentially helpful nursing responses to mental distress, as opposed to the theorising that surrounds these helping responses.\nThe theories of psychiatry and psychology are neither necessary nor sufficient in providing a foundation for an autonomous psychiatric nursing. While medications have an intrinsic helpfulness for some people, for some of their problems, for some of the time, this does not illuminate the causes of mental distress. There is an intrinsic helping response in human interpersonal communication, yet this is not specific to 'psychotherapy' and does not 'belong' solely to psychotherapists.\nSupport is found for an autonomous and independent profession of psychiatric nursing, able to provide a helping response to those in mental distress independent of psychiatry and psychology."}, {"Title": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults-early vs. late onset in a retrospective study.", "Abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a severe and often debilitating mental disorder, which begins in childhood and can persist into adulthood. Both major classificatory systems, ICD-10 and DSM-IV, include the age-of-onset criterion (AOC) requiring clinically relevant symptoms before the age of 7 years. In clinical practice, particularly in adult psychiatry, it is often difficult to establish this AOC when ADHD remained unrecognized in childhood. In the literature, there is controversy about the validity of this criterion. In order to explore the validity of the AOC, we performed a retrospective study in adult patients with ADHD. Fifty consecutively diagnosed patients were subjected to a standardized diagnostic procedure. Depending on the onset of clinical symptoms, patients were divided in an early onset and in a late onset ADHD subgroup. Fourteen patients (28%) described late onset ADHD.

Validation is based on universally valid humanist principles. A person is viewed as an individual being having a good reason for his current behavior. This is true for \"still oriented\" as well as for \"non-oriented\" persons. It is necessary to recognize and categorize the different behavioral patterns in the various phases of disorientation. Here we speak of the physical and psychological characteristics of the four phases of disorientation. The target group is persons who are just still oriented, but deny their current situation and thus react peculiaryly. The next group is the time and place disoriented persons. Subsequently the group of persons who can express themselves solely by nonverbal means, i.e. repetitive movements, follows. The last group is motionless persons who simply vegetate. In addition, there are suitable verbal and nonverbal techniques that can be used in a most sensible and appreciative way of dealing with these highly aged. The aged persons are not corrected and not oriented according to reality, but are escorted in their world. We call this: \"walking in the shoes of the other person\". It is necessary to take emotions seriously and to share them with others. We do not take position, we do not judge and we also do not offer hasty solutions. We are honest and do not use well-meant lies.

Practically all psychiatric schools are characterized by their orientation towards a morbid, atypical behaviour. This, however, inevitably narrows the view of the soul of a person. Despite mental illness, resources are always present, these though are not recognized and not utilized. The theory of salutogenesis with its search for health preserving factors has significantly expanded insight on dynamic mental processes. The resulting concept of health promotion attempts to develop patient's self-healing powers by identifying healthy parts and supporting them by instructing patients in active participation. From a health promotion viewpoint, it is necessary to intervene at three levels: 1. At the patient level in the form of guidance and help to actively participate in the healing process. 2. At the staff level in the form of creating healthy work conditions and the promotion of active participation in the creation of this work environment. 3. At the level of psychiatric institutions in the form of promoting efficient communications structures within and between the various services.

Sociological analysis of the present describes dramatic changes in society, which also have consequences for the subject's mastering of everyday routines and formation of identity. As opposed to neo-liberal promises of sheer limitless new opportunities, respectable interpretations of current times describe an ambivalent process that by far does not positively effect all groups in society, and in fact increases the danger of social exclusion. Exclusionary processes particularly affect persons, who do not fulfill the new requirements of hyper flexibility, mobility and allround fitness. Justifiably the question arises whether these requirements themselves induce the destruction of personality. This brings up the question if there is an alternative to the neoliberal view of humankind.

Menopause-related disorders can appear 2 to 6 years before and continue for 2 to 6 years after menopause, with their duration up to 20 years. An attempt of qualitative approach to menopausal ailments is the point scale by Kupperman. The diversity of the symptoms encountered in women in perimenopausal period is the reason to seek medical advice from experts in various disciplines: internal medicine, cardiology, gynaecology, neurology, rheumatology, and least frequently psychiatry, as it is fairly common for women to perceive life problems or mental stress as somatic disorder. In Poland, middle-aged women constitute 30% of all women. Medical approach to their health problems is focused on somatic diseases like myocardial infarction, cerebral stroke, and cancer, which are likely to contribute to shortening of life expectancy. Growing awareness of the problem of depression among doctors non-psychiatrists may contribute to desirable change in doctors' and patients' attitude to this disease. The average prevalence of depression is estimated to be about 17% of the total population. Depression is thrice more frequent among women than among men. The peak of incidence is seen among middle-aged patients. In this article clinical forms of affective disorders are discussed according to the current DSM IV classification, main symptoms suggesting depression are given, and masked depression, the most common and most difficult to detect form of the disease is discussed. Risk factors for depression are presented, and attention is paid to the dramatic fact that depression may not only decrease the quality of life, but may also stand behind the patient's loss of full functional capacity or even death. Suicidal thoughts are experienced by 60% of depressive patients, while as many as 15% of them do actually commit suicide. Collective analysis of the depression risk factors and concomitant somatic disorders in a given patient will surely increase the likelihood of correct diagnosis."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of medical student attitudes toward alcoholics anonymous.", "Abstract": "This is a two-phase study on attitudes of medical students toward Alcoholics Anonymous.

At treatment centres specialising in a certain type of trauma, like war, torture or sexual abuse, the aetiology may be regarded as self-explanatory. Recent surveys of general populations reveal high rates of PTSD, often following exposure to multiple traumatic events. Traumas are frequently overlooked in general psychiatric settings and PTSD is underestimated. Such findings indicate the need to conceptualise trauma in terms of multiple events and to examine the aetiology of PTSD amongst patients in everyday psychiatric practice. The present study examines aetiological factors of PTSD in three minority groups at a general psychiatric outpatient clinic. Arabs, Iranians and Turks selected from an entire year's cohort of patients-and a sample of Swedish patients of similar age and gender distribution.\nHistories were collected from 115 patients, both regarding their own traumas and traumas involving relatives and close friends, by means of a questionnaire. A self-rating instrument for PTSD, with no reference to a specific trauma, was used in order to study the relationship between trauma and PTSD outcome.\nOf the patients, 89% had experienced at least one trauma, and 77% multiple traumatic events. The prevalence of probable PTSD varied between ethnic groups: Iranians 69%, Arabs 59%, Turks 53% and Swedes 29%. In a logistic regression analysis, probable PTSD outcome was associated with multiplicity of relatives' traumas (OR = 3.14), multiplicity of own traumas (OR = 2.56) and belonging to an ethnic minority (OR = 2.44), but not with gender. No patient without a trauma history was positively assessed for probable PTSD.\nThe symptomatic syndrome of probable PTSD does not appear in the absence of extreme trauma, lending empirical support to the definition of PTSD. Prevalence increases with multiplicity of traumas, including those involving a relative or close friend. The high prevalence of probable PTSD found in this study warrants screening for trauma among patients, their relatives and close friends, in outpatient psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The role of managed care and financing in medical practices: how does psychiatry differ from other medical fields?", "Abstract": "The organization and financing of medical practice has experienced substantial changes during the past decade.

While it is clear that these changes in managed care penetration and financing arrangements have affected physicians and the way they practice medicine, it is less clear whether there has been a differential effect across physician types.\nData are from the Community Tracking Study (CTS) physician survey, a national survey of active physicians in the United States fielded between August 1998 and November 1999. To be eligible, physicians had to have completed their medical training (which excludes residents, interns, or fellows), be practicing in the contiguous United States, and be providing direct patient care for at least 20h per week. The total number of completed interviews was 12,304, including 566 psychiatrists, 7,217 primary care physicians, and 4,521 other medical or surgical specialists. Consistent with the previous literature, our analysis is primarily descriptive presenting weighted means and odds ratios from multivariate models.\nPsychiatrists are significantly less likely than primary care physicians or other specialists to agree with the statements that clinical decisions in the interest of their patients do not reduce income. Further, in comparison to primary care physicians, psychiatrists are less likely to agree that it is possible to maintain continuing relationships with patients over time that promote the delivery of high quality care and that they have the freedom to make clinical decisions that meet their patients' needs. In contrast to the perceived impacts on practice, psychiatrists tend to work in practices with a lower dependence on managed care than either other specialists or primary care physicians. Regarding individual physician compensation among non-owners, psychiatrists are less likely than other physicians to have their income adjusted based on individual productivity.\nPsychiatrists are more concerned that managed care has a negative impact on patient-provider relationships than other physicians; however, based on the available measures of financing and organization, psychiatrists are less dependent on managed care. This may suggest that other aspects of managed care, such as pre-authorization and gatekeeping, that disproportionately affect specialists are driving psychiatrists' perceptions of the patient-provider relationship."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric resident conceptualizations of mood and affect within the mental status examination.", "Abstract": "To explore the ways in which psychiatry residents conceptualize the terms \"mood\" and \"affect,\" a 14-item questionnaire was sent to residency programs in New York.\nThe questions consisted of possible definitions of mood and affect; all questions required a \"true\" or \"false\" response. Residents (N=99) were asked how they viewed mood and affect from a temporal perspective (i.e., sustained versus momentary) and in terms of an objective-subjective (or external-internal) dichotomy.\nThere were inconsistencies in the temporal view of mood (said to be sustained by 60.6% and momentary by 50.5%) and affect (\"pervasive\" by 26.3% and \"momentary\" by 66.3%). Residents overwhelmingly defined mood as being subjective and internal and affect as being objective and external.\nIf mood and affect are to be viewed from both perspectives, psychiatrists must infer the enduring internal emotional tone (mood) of a patient over an entire interview."}, {"Title": "Mental health.", "Abstract": "Only in the last 30 years has psychiatry begun to develop empirical approaches to conceptualizing and assessing positive mental health. Six models of mental health are reviewed here.\nThe author points out pitfalls in research on mental health, e.g., equating average with healthy, failing to distinguish trait from state, overlooking cultural norms, and conversely, blindly accepting the culture's values. He describes the six models and provides history and research needs for each.\nThe first model, being \"above normal,\" is epitomized by DSM-IV's axis V, the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. High scores represent \"superior functioning in a wide range of activities, life's problems never seem to get out of hand, is sought out by others because of his or her many positive qualities.\" The goal of the second model, positive psychology, is intervention to maximize positive qualities, such as self-efficacy. Maturity and Erikson's four developmental tasks (identity, intimacy, generativity, integrity) are the basis of the third model. The author adds two other tasks: career consolidation and \"keeper of the meaning.\" The fourth model is emotional or social intelligence, the ability to read other people's emotions. Surprisingly, subjective well-being, the fifth model, is as much a characteristic of temperament as of a benign environment. The last model, resilience, is epitomized by DSM-IV's Defense Function Scale, which categorizes coping mechanisms in terms of adaptational value.\nAs with the blind men and the elephant, each model describes only some aspects of mental health.

Researchers are beginning to examine the role of the phase II UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, which produce products that are more water-soluble, less toxic and more readily excreted than the parent compounds. Several reasons may have contributed to neglect of UGTs (compared to CYPs) including: (1) the overlapping activity of UGTs and lack of selective probes; (2) the complexity of the glucuronidation cycle; and (3) the difficulty in developing analytic methods to measure glucuronides. Current CYP knowledge is used as a model to predict advances in UGT knowledge. At least 24 different UGT human genes have been identified and are classified in two families (UGT1 and UGT2) based on sequence homology. The UGT1A subfamily (genes located on chromosome 2) glucuronidates bilirubin, thyroid hormones, and some medications. UGT1A4 metabolizes tricyclic antidepressants and some antipsychotics. The UGT2B subfamily (genes located on chromosome 6) glucuronidates sexual steroids and bile acids. Oxazepam and lorazepam are mainly metabolized by glucuronidation. Anti-epileptics with mood-stabilizing properties are frequently metabolized by UGTs. Opioid and nicotine addiction may also be influenced by glucuronidation. Glucuronidation of serotonin may be important during fetal development. UGTs appear to be in small concentrations in brain tissue (and higher concentrations at brain capillaries). However, UGTs may be localized in certain brain areas to provide a neuroprotective function. This review illustrates the importance of glucuronidation and the implications for psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The importance of a pleasant process of treatment: lessons on healing from South India.", "Abstract": "This paper considers the significance of the positive and negative aesthetic qualities of different therapies--in other words, how \"pleasant\" (a term that is elaborated in the paper) it is to undergo various treatments. Interviews were conducted with patients undergoing three forms of healing for mental illness and related problems in the state of Kerala in southern India--ayurvedic (indigenous) psychiatry, allopathic (biomedical) psychiatry, and religious healing. Informants revealed concerns about the aesthetic process of therapy, reporting adverse reactions to allopathic treatments and in some cases asserting that they enjoyed ayurvedic procedures. Some informants with long-term illnesses had chosen to live in the process of therapy and reside indefinitely in the aesthetically engaging environment of a mosque, temple, or church after pursuing medical therapies for years. Thus considerations of the quality of the process of therapy also call for an examination of the limitations of the concept of \"cure\" for describing what is accomplished in healing in some therapeutic settings."}, {"Title": "Toward a culture-bound syndrome-based insanity defense?", "Abstract": "The American Psychiatric Association's recent inclusion of a Glossary of Culture-Bound Syndromes within DSM-IV draws upon decades of medical anthropological and cultural psychiatric research to afford culture-bound syndromes (CBSs) a newfound legitimacy within professional Western psychiatric nosology. While DSM-IV's recognition of the CBS concept as a category of psychosocial distress has important clinical implications for mental health care practitioners throughout the world, it also has significant legal implications. Given that several CBSs involve a degree of psychological impairment that may satisfy the standard for legal insanity under certain circumstances, this essay focuses on the potential emergence of an insanity defense based on the claim that an immigrant or minority defendant was suffering from a CBS at the time of his or her criminal act. Aimed at initiating interdisciplinary debate over the reification of the CBS concept, the essay discusses the theoretical ambiguity and status of CBSs within professional Western psychiatry, describes what a CBS-based insanity defense might look like, and considers the relevant challenges facing medical anthropologists and cultural psychiatrists, on the one hand, and legal practitioners, on the other. The essay identifies a pressing need for interdisciplinary debate concerning the validity, scope, and viability of CBS-based insanity defenses."}, {"Title": "Ascertaining capacity to consent: a survey of approaches used by psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "Doctors are increasingly criticised for imposing treatment without adequate consent.

The questionnaire consisted of two case-vignettes and a series of seven questions (six with forced choice yes/no answers and one with an open-ended answer). The responding psychiatrists' assessment of capacity and that judged by the research psychiatrist were compared. There was no relationship between age, sex, duration of experience in psychiatry, grade and speciality, and (i) the respondents' assessment of capacity and (ii) the research psychiatrist's assessment of capacity. The kappa concordance between the responding psychiatrists' assessment of capacity and that judged by the research psychiatrist was 0.17 (P=0.067) and 0.12 (P>0.05) for vignettes 1 and 2 respectively.

Neuroleptics were prescribed in 28% of the individuals, hypnotics/anxiolytics in 33% and antidepressants in 12%. Prescription of neuroleptics was significantly predicted by institutional placement (other than long-stay care hospital facility), lower cognitive function and rural geographical area. Age greater than 75 years and lower functional score (lower dependency) significantly decreased the likelihood of receipt of neuroleptics. Antidepressant use was significantly less likely in male subjects, patients with cognitive impairment and patients greater than 85 years. Institutional placement (other than long-stay care hospital facility and old age psychiatry facility) and rural locality predicted increased likelihood of antidepressant prescription. Institutional placement (other than long-stay care hospital facility) and geographical (rural) location were significant independent predictors of hypnotic/anxiolytic use. Prescription of hypnotic/anxiolytic drug class was significantly less likely in those individuals with lower cognitive status.

A silent polymorphism (G to C substitution) in the gene encoding the autoreceptor 5-HT1B was linked to antisocial alcoholism in Finnish and an American Indian populations [Lappalainen et al., 1998: Arch Gen Psychiatry 55:989-994]. Several other polymorphisms of this gene have been investigated for their association with neuropsychiatric disorders. In the present study, a sample of 133 alcoholics without and 39 alcoholics with medical complications, and 88 normal controls was screened for three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), G861C, G261T, and C129T, in the 5-HT1B gene. The goal was to investigate their association with the disease, to measure the strength of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the SNPs, and to compare haplotype frequencies between alcoholic groups and normal controls. Data was also analyzed on the basis of Type I (n = 47) and Type II (n = 85) alcoholism. There was no significant difference in the allele frequencies or the genotype distribution between any alcoholic groups, alcoholic subgroups, and controls for any polymorphism. G861C and C129T polymorphisms were in complete LD. The pattern of distribution of haplotypes was similar in patients and controls. It is concluded that these SNPs are not playing any direct role in the development of susceptibility to alcoholism in our patient sample."}, {"Title": "Tumor necrosis factor haplotype analysis amongst schizophrenia probands from four distinct populations in the Asia-Pacific region.", "Abstract": "A single nucleotide polymorphism (TNF(-308A)) within the promoter region of the gene encoding tumor necrosis factor (TNF), has been significantly associated with schizophrenia in a study of Italian patients and control subjects Boin et al.

Of the four observed haplotypes, we and others have observed only one carries the TNF(-308A) variant allele. We report no significant differences in TNF promoter haplotype frequencies between the patient and control groups within each population, although the Indian Fijian cohort showed a trend towards reduced TNF(-308A) alleles amongst schizophrenia cases (P = 0.07). We found no evidence of bias in TNF promoter haplotype transmission to schizophrenia probands. Very similar results were obtained when only the TNF(-308) polymorphism was considered.

A total of 1760 completed questionnaires were received but 28 were ruled out as inappropriate. Of the remainder, 1041 respondents stated that they had been, or were, suffering from BD. The remainder stated that they were suffering from depression, dysthymia or atypical depression.\nThe findings indicate that, on average, a bipolar patient is expected to wait for 5.7 years for a correct diagnosis from the first onset of symptoms. Many patients have a family history of mood and anxiety disorders. They experience a high degree of stigmatization from all quarters. This is reflected in the difficulties they experience in obtaining employment despite high academic achievement. Most patients receive combination therapy. Compliance problems resulting from adverse side-effects are less significant than in the past. Overall, the level of satisfaction with pharmacotherapy was high yet, paradoxically, patients had reservations about dependency issues and possible long-term side-effects.\nThere was a clear need for more patient education about pharmacological and psychosocial interventions, despite material progress having been made over the past decade. There is an urgent need for more information and education for both relatives and the public in most European countries to improve awareness and understanding of BDs and other mood disorders and the doctor-patient dialogue."}, {"Title": "A prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder-I phenotype: review of phenomenology and longitudinal course.", "Abstract": "Phenomenology, assessment, longitudinal, and psychosocial findings from an ongoing, controlled, prospective study of 93 subjects with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype (PEA-BP) will be reviewed.\nUnlike adult-onset bipolar disorder, for which there were over 50 years of systematic investigations, there were a paucity of rigorous data and much controversy and skepticism about the existence and characteristics of prepubertal-onset mania. With this background, issues to address for investigation of child-onset mania included the following: (i) What to do about the differentiation of mania from attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). (ii) How to deal with the ubiquity of irritability as a presenting symptom in multiple child psychiatry disorders. (iii) Development of a research instrument to assess prepubertal manifestations of adult mania (i.e. children do not 'max out' credit cards or have four marriages). (iv) How to distinguish normal childhood happiness and expansiveness from pathologically impairing elated mood and grandiosity.\nTo address these issues, a PEA-BP phenotype was defined as DSM-IV mania with elated mood and/or grandiosity as one inclusion criterion. This criterion ensured that the diagnosis of mania was not made using only criteria that overlapped with those for ADHD, and that subjects had at least one of the two cardinal symptoms of mania (i.e. elated mood and grandiose behaviors). Subjects were aged 10.9 years (SD = 2.6) and age of onset of the current episode at baseline was 7.3 years (SD = 3.5). Validation of PEA-BP was shown by reliable assessment, 6-month stability, and 1- and 2-year diagnostic longitudinal outcome. PEA-BP resembled the severest form of adult-onset mania by presenting with a chronic, mixed mania, psychotic, continuously (ultradian) cycling picture.\nCounterintuitively, typical 7-year-old children with PEA-BP were more severely ill than typical 27 year olds with adult-onset mania.

Advanced treatment units also appeared to have minimized psychiatric battle casualties during Korean and Vietnamese Wars. Evaluations of its use by Israeli forces in the Lebanon conflict showed higher return-to-duty rates than at base hospitals.

DBS precisely targets neuroanatomical targets deep within the brain that are proposed to be centrally involved in the pathophysiology of some neuropsychiatric illnesses. DBS is nonablative, offering the advantages of reversibility and adjustability. This might permit therapeutic effectiveness to be enhanced or side effects to be minimized. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown effects of DBS locally, at the stimulation target, and at a distance, via actions on fibers of passage or across synapses. Although its mechanisms of action are not fully elucidated, several effects have been proposed to underlie the therapeutic effects of DBS in movement disorders, and potentially in other conditions as well. The mechanisms of action of DBS are the focus of active investigation in a number of clinical and preclinical laboratories. As in severe movement disorders, DBS may offer a degree of hope for patients with intractable neuropsychiatric illness. It is already clear that research intended to realize this potential will require a very considerable commitment of resources, energy, and time across disciplines including psychiatry, neurosurgery neurology, neuropsychology, bioengineering, and bioethics.

Over the past 5 years, applications in other neuropsychiatric disorders have been investigated with a special emphasis on depression. Recent data from an open-label, multi-center pilot study involving 60 patients suggest a potential clinical usefulness in the acute and maintenance treatment of drug-resistant depressive disorder. The perspective of VNS as along-term treatment with the advantage of assured compliance makes it an interesting technique to potentially treat drug-resistant depression. However, definite therapeutic effects of clinical significance remain to be confirmed in large placebo-controlled trial. Results of clinical pilot studies involving patients suffering from obesity and Alzheimer's disease indicate that VNS might induce weight loss and improve cognition. Besides its clinical usefulness, VNS can be used as a research tool, allowing neurophysiologic investigations of the parasympathetic system and its interactions with other parts of the central nervous system."}, {"Title": "Evidence-based mental health policy: a critical appraisal.", "Abstract": "Arguments for and against evidence-based psychiatry have mostly centred on its value for clinical practice and teaching.

Overweight and obesity increase the risk for developing many serious chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and certain cancers. Increased morbidity due to obesity-related disorders begins within the normal weight range. Weight gain in adulthood per se, even in individuals who are normal weight, has deleterious health effects.

The average age was 73,8 % were divorced, 20% never married, 32% widowed and 32% married. The most frequent diagnosis was Major Depressive Disorder of late onset followed by Personality Disorder ( 96%; 48%). The most frequent method was intoxication, (68.75% BDZ). Almost half of the attempts were highly severe.\nWe may infer that the elderly person who attempts suicide: is female, 68-78 years old, does not have a partner, lives with someone, has Major Depressive Disorder (at least half of them had Personality Disorder) and a clinical disease. This is her first attempt, is alone at home, and she does not advise others. Reduced hearing is a very frequent co-morbidity."}, {"Title": "[The liaison psychiatry approach of the psychiatric crisis, urgencies and emergencies].", "Abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to differentiate crisis, emergencies and urgencies within the frame of Liaison psychiatry.

About half the respondents perceived their CAM searches as being only partially successful. Eighty-two percent rated MEDLINE as a useful resource, 46% personal contacts with colleagues, 46% the Web, 40% journals, and 20% textbooks. Books and databases most frequently cited as useful had information about herbs. The largest group of respondents was in internal medicine (26%), though 15% identified their specialties as psychiatry, psychology, behavioral medicine, or addiction medicine. There was no correlation between specialty and patterns of information-seeking behavior. Sixty-six percent expressed an interest in learning more about CAM resources.\nHealth professionals are frequently unable to locate the CAM information they need, and the majority have little knowledge of existing CAM resources, relying instead on MEDLINE.

Rather than pursue this war using conventional means, terrorist tactics have been employed. Terrorism represents psychological warfare, not traditional military combat. Threats of assassination, bioterrorism, and even nuclear detonations have been used. Numerous attacks have subsequently been realized against both domestic and international American targets. Winning the war against terrorism means acknowledging and responding to the psychological dynamics inherent in this form of warfare, as well as the military and law enforcement aspects of the war. Consistent with Caplan's notions of preventive psychiatry, the fight against terrorism must occur on three levels: (1) prevention of the terrorist attacks themselves, (2) mitigating the adverse psychological impact of the persistent threats of terrorist acts, as well as the terrorist attacks when they do occur, and (3) psychological treatment of the lingering adverse effects of threatened or actualized terrorist attacks. The preplanned and/or coordinated psychological efforts to counteract terrorism and prevail in any given war against terrorism shall be herein discussed and subsequently referred to as \"psychological counterterrorism.\""}, {"Title": "Teaching the consultant teachers in psychiatry: experience in Birmingham.", "Abstract": "This paper describes the establishment and evaluation of a single specialty programme for the development of teaching skills in senior doctors.

My first instinct was to review work undertaken in ay countries by famous researchers such as Harden, Colliver, Rothman, van der Vleuten, Stillman, Tamblyn and others who have studied and written about the validity of OSCEs. I could then have reviewed the extensive literature produced in Canada by the Medical Council of Canada and in the United States by the Education Commission on Foreign Medical Graduates and National Board of Medical Examiners that has demonstrated the utility of large-scale OSCEs for certification and licensure. I might have tossed in a few papers from my own research on the validity of OSCEs in psychiatry. Indeed, it would have been relatively easy to marshal the medical education literature to answer the question 'Are OSCEs valid to assess competence' strongly in the affirmative. But the more I reflected on the question, the more I confronted concerns that have troubled me for some time. Specifically, I worry that our approaches to validity may themselves not be valid. In this paper, I review what I believe to be three serious problems with our current approaches to showing that 'the OSCE is valid' Let me begin by rethinking the question. What do we mean 'Is the OSCE valid for assessing competence' There are three important problems with this question. First, validity is a property of the application of a test, not of a test itself. Second, we cannot speak of validity without giving consideration to the context in which we use the test. And finally, the concept of validity flounders because the OSCE itself is an important agent in constructing the variables of performance that it is designed to measure. I shall consider each issue in turn."}, {"Title": "Dean Milton C. Winternitz at Yale.", "Abstract": "Milton Winternitz led Yale Medical School as its Dean from 1920 to 1935. An innovative, even maverick leader, he not only kept the school from going under, but turned it into a first-class research institution. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about \"social medicine\" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the \"Yale System\" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department, built numerous new buildings, and much more. It is a loss to 21st-century medicine that his dream of an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, lasted for only a few years, before falling victim to the more obvious triumphs of medical science and technology. It is sad, too, that he is remembered largely as a Jew presiding over a medical school that, like most others, restricted the number of Jewish students, rather than for his contributions to American medicine."}, {"Title": "A quantitative genetic analysis of schizotypal personality traits.", "Abstract": "Previous twin studies investigating the heritability of schizotypy have often had limited power and have failed to measure the disorganization/social anxiety component.\nSeven hundred and thirty-three female twin pairs, drawn from the Institute of Psychiatry Volunteer Twin Register, completed the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences and the Peters et al. Delusions Inventory. Structural equation modelling was carried out on scores for MZ and DZ twin pairs.\nThe best fitting models for all scales comprised additive genetic and unique environmental effects. Heritability was estimated at approximately 50% for most scales, although it was lower at 37% for the PDI scale. Multivariate structural equation model fitting revealed a best-fitting model in which additive genetic and unique environmental influences act through a single common pathway for Cognitive Disorganization, Unusual Experiences and the PDI, and through a separate common pathway for Cognitive Disorganization and Introvertive Anhedonia.\nThe various components of schizotypy are moderately heritable. Multivariate model fitting indicates that at least two latent factor structures are required to account for the covariation between the various components of schizotypy. The positive and negative components of schizotypy are relatively genetically independent, although each in turn may be related to Cognitive Disorganization."}, {"Title": "Volitional impairment and the sexually violent predator.", "Abstract": "This article discusses psychiatry's limited conceptualization of volitional capacity and its application to sexually violent predator laws by exploring two legal opinions critical to predator case law (Kansas v. Hendricks and Kansas v. Crane). The author reviewed pertinent psychiatric literature on impaired volition to identify potential contributions and limitations that psychiatry may offer the legal field. Assessment of the ego dystonic nature of impaired self-regulation, utilization of recent advances in self-assessment and laboratory evaluation of impulsive behavior, and dimensional categorization of a volitional capacity construct are recommended as an approach to the assessment and understanding of an inability to control concept. This paper concludes that elements of volition may be psychiatrically evaluated in a way that contributes to the Court's understanding of that capacity. However, further study is needed to operationally define volitional capacity and address issues of assessment validity and reliability."}, {"Title": "[Evaluation of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder: validation of a measure, the PCLS].", "Abstract": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder frequently found in psychiatric clinic and in the population of victims of traumatic events. PTSD, characterized by an intense fear, helplessness or horror, resulting from exposure to a traumatic event, is clinically manifested with three main syndromes: reexperiencing, avoidance behavior and numbing of emotion, and physiological hyperarousal. The Post-Traumatic Checklist Scale (PCLS) is a brief and self-report questionnaire for evaluating the severity of three main syndromes of PTSD. The scale can be divided into three sub-scores corresponding to the three main syndromes of the disorder: reexperiencing (items 1-5), avoidance (items 6-12) and hyperarousal (items 13-17). The validation studies in English version (Weathers et al., 1993, Blanchard et al., 1996) and French version (Ventureyra et al., 2001) showed that the PCLS possesses good psychometric properties. But the discriminating validation with another pathological group and the sensitivity of the scale to change of treatment have not yet been studied up to now. The aim of this study is the validation of the French version of the PCLS in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) subjects compared with subjects suffering from other anxiety disorders and non-clinical subjects. The sensitivity of the PCLS after a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for PTSD was studied for the first time. Fifty-seven outpatients suffering from PTSD according to DSM IV criteria, 23 patients suffering from other anxiety disorders and 28 non-clinical subjects were included in this study. All subjects were assessed with the PCLS. The Beck Depression Inventory--13 items (BDI-13) and the Fear Questionnaire (FQ) were used for the two groups of patients. Fifty-five PTSD patients were administered the PCLS twice over an interval of one to two weeks without any intervention in order to determine the test-retest reliability of the PCLS. And 24 PTSD patients were reassessed with the PCLS after 16 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in order to study the sensitivity to treatment of the PCLS. The CBT technique for PTSD consisted of relaxation, exposition, recital, cognitive restructuration and stress management. The total score and the subscores on the PCLS were found to be significantly higher in PTSD patients than in two control groups: suffering from other anxiety disorders subjects (61.2/41.4, p<0.0001) and non-clinical subjects (61.2/28.8, p<0.0001). The correlation between the PCLS total score and the others measures showed that the PCLS correlated significantly with the depression measure, the BDI-13 (p<0.001), and the sub-scores of Fear Questionnaire (agoraphobia: p<0.001; anxiety-depression: p<0.001; distress: p<0.001), but not with the social phobia sub-score of the FQ. The PCLS showed a satisfactory test-retest reliability in 55 patients (the total score: r=0.75, p<0.0001; the sub-score of reexperiencing: r=0.844, p<0.0001; the sub-score of avoidance: r=0.702, p<0.0001; the sub-score of hyperarousal: r=0.712, p<0.0001). The t-test showed that the total score of the PCLS was significantly reduced in 24 patients after 16 sessions of CBT (the mean gain=13.1, t=5.63, p<0.0001). The results of our study confirm that the PCLS possesses good empirical and discriminating validity and a good sensitivity. The fact that the PTSD patients reported significantly higher total scores on the PCLS and its three subscores than other anxiety disorder subjects and non-clinical subjects indicates that the PCLS differentiates well the patients presenting PTSD from other anxiety disorder subjects and non-clinical subjects. The PCLS total score also correlates significantly with the other measures of psychopathology used in the study, such as measures of phobia (the Fear Questionnaire agoraphobia subscale), depression (the Beck Depression Inventory -13) and distress (the Fear Questionnaire distress subscale). This may be explained by the fact that some PTSD symptoms overlap with those of depression and of anxiety or phobia. The PCLS showed anxiety or phobia. The PCLS showed a satisfactory test-retest reliability. The PCLS is therefore a valid and effective measurement of PTSD. It may be a useful tool for screening and assessing PTSD in clinical practice and research in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[A clinical study of emergent anxiety in neuroleptic-na\u00efve, first-episode schizophrenia patients following treatment with risperidone].", "Abstract": "Risperidone (RIS) alone was administered to patients with neuroleptic-na\u00efve, first-episode schizophrenia who visited the outpatient clinic of the Department of Psychiatry, Jikei University School of Medicine Hospital between April 1998 and December 2001, and the effectiveness of the drug in alleviating anxiety symptoms was prospectively examined. The study population comprised 42 patients (24 males and 18 females). Their mean age at first visit was 26.0 +/- 6.5 years, DUP (Duration of Untreated Psychosis) was 41.1 +/- 60.0 weeks, and the mean total BPRS (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) score at first visit was 60.5 +/- 8.5 points. The rating \"effective\" (a total BPRS score improvement at week 8 of 50% or more) was given to 32 out of the 42 patients (76.2%). Among these 32 patients, a 25% improvement in the PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) positive scale was achieved at 1. 53 +/- 0.72 weeks and a 50% improvement at 2.93 +/- 2.10 weeks, suggesting early onset of the effects of RIS. The present study focused on the anxiety complained of by some of the patients in whom treatment was rated as effective (increase of 2 points in anxiety BPRS score), dividing these patients into an anxiety group and a non-anxiety group. The anxiety group comprised 17 patients (53.1%). The anxiety observed during the course of treatment with RIS tended to develop early after the disappearance of positive symptoms. A comparison of demographic factors and GAF between the two groups revealed a significant difference in mean age at first visit, DUP and GAF score, the anxiety group tending to be younger, to have shorter DUP and to have social dysfunction compared to the non-anxiety group. Although it cannot be concluded that these anxiety symptoms are characteristic of risperidone, the effect of chemotherapy with other atypical antipsychotic drugs remains as an interesting theme for future investigation."}, {"Title": "[What should general hospital psychiatry do in a community?].", "Abstract": "Some experiences in Nagano Red Cross hospital and Nagano Prefecture are presented, and the role of general hospital psychiatry (GHP) in a community is discussed. Psychiatric services in Nagano prefecture with population 2.21 million consist of four blocks. Our unit is in north block, providing treatment for acute phase and, in 2000, 1504 cases were new outpatients, daily outpatients were 198 cases and new inpatients were 604 cases including 146 emergency inpatients. In fiscal 2001, 25.6% of notifications of involuntary hospitalization from all psychiatric hospitals were submitted from GHP occupying 12.9% psychiatric beds, and 129 notifications from our unit were largest in Nagano prefecture. Total 7 GHPs with beds are presented by some data, suggesting two types as GHP. One type has relatively many new inpatients by small beds with short-term hospitalization like our GHP, and another type has relatively small new inpatients by large beds with long-term hospitalization like conventional mental hospital. It is necessary for GHP to pursue the former type, and to functionally differentiate from psychiatric hospital. Results of psychiatric emergency system in Nagano prefecture are presented. Designated hospitals are our GHP with 60 beds in north block, Prefectural Hospital with 310 beds in south block, National Sanatorium with 280 beds in east block and rotating 5 psychiatric hospitals with total 968 beds in west block. GHP with 60 beds hospitalized more emergency new cases than other psychiatric hospitals with large beds and discharged 84% of emergency inpatients to their home. Recently, short-term hospitalization of general hospital beds has rapidly progressed, and shared goal settings are needed, and treatment plans with teamwork by various types of experts have started from community-based home care. This teamwork will be expected throughout community psychiatric services. Although until today GHP's ward unit is financially disadvantageous, patients anticipate medical care of GHP on same level as a part of general hospital of course. For community psychiatric care and short-term hospitalization it is necessary for GHP to cooperate with various types of social resources. As for users of rehabilitation facilities in Nagano prefecture, GHP outpatients occupy 27.2%, and as for day care users, these occupy 19.6%, thus GHPs are able to cooperate with facilities. Above-mentioned facts indicate there is high necessity as a GHP, not a psychiatric hospital or a clinic. Cooperation between GHP and other social resources including welfare services will enrich community psychiatric services. GHP is a wide entrance for psychiatric care from a viewpoints of whole psychiatric care. When GHP accepted all patients on demands from acute cases to chronic, manpower will be diffused, and safety of medical care will be undermined. Therefore, psychiatric triage mainly functioning to treat early stage in severe cases with combined medical and psychiatric illness above all is necessary for GHP in order to offer proper treatment to a community. Accessibility in early stage of disease, priority of seriously ill patients and rehabilitation programs at a community as daily life space are essential for community mental health. We believe the first role of GHP in a community is to seek for psychiatric treatment on same level as general medicine. The second role is the psychiatric triage in order to function as GHP in a community. The third role is to cooperate with other social resources in a community. In order to promote the above it is necessary to self-evaluate GHP concerning the difference with specialized psychiatric hospitals or clinics. From these viewpoints GHP will become a core of community psychiatry. Currently, however, preparation concerned with GHP is poor compared with other advanced countries, so an aggressive improvement in medical policy is expected."}, {"Title": "[Critical evaluation of the current status of general hospital psychiatry in Japan].", "Abstract": "The number of beds necessary for medical care was determined in 1985 by the Secondary Medical Law Act, therefore community medical care has been functioning well. However, the number of beds necessary for mental care is still defined according to each prefecture, which results that community mental care is not always adequate. The total number of beds for the mentally ill is 360,000, of which general hospitals have only approximately 20,000 (5.8%). This means that in-patient mental care in Japan mostly depends upon mental hospitals. In order to promote mental care in general hospitals and to improve the position of psychiatrists in all medical fields, the Japanese Society of General Hospital Psychiatry (JSGHP) was established in 1988. In this article, the author describe the current problems in mental care and discuss about the topics concerning general hospital psychiatry in Japan."}, {"Title": "Philosophical anthropology and psychiatry: typus melancholicus as a human disposition.", "Abstract": "Key ideas of philosophical anthropology furnish the framework for a description of the personality type, typus melancholicus.

These dispositional vectors are: over-identification with social norms (hypernomia), struggle with social norms (agonomia), under-identification with social norms (hyponomia), and over-identification with personal norms (idionomia). When the dispositional vector of hypernomia moves in a pathological direction, it becomes the personality type, typus melancholicus.

In the large western states inpatient care is still dominated by the structures of the large regional hospitals. Outpatient care, dominated by psychiatrists and psychotherapists in private practise, is less densely provided in East Germany. Sheltered accommodation is provided predominantly in hostels. The states with better community orientation in hospital care offer fewer sheltered accommodation.\nThe process of psychiatric reform is not accomplished yet, particularly concerning hospital care in the large western states and sheltered accommodation in general. A possible cause for the weak implementation of community orientation in hospital services in the large western states might be the strong position of hospital responsables that oppose the closing down of hospitals. Incentives for implementing supported housing are weak.

It introduces the thinking of Heidegger at the Zollikon Seminars, conducted by the Swiss psychoanalyst Medard Boss, founder of Daseinanalyse and presented to a group of Swiss psychiatrists. Heidegger opposed Freud's scientific Weltanschauung and his hydraulic system of metapsychology, objecting that it dehumanizes the patient. He emphasized the importance of the therapist's \"presence\" and openness to the patient. He utilized phenomenology to prevent relating to the patient as an \"other\" or \"thing\" and advocated a hermeneutic approach instead. This approach involves the use of questions and answers to gain a gradual explicit understanding of the unique communications from the individual patient. He opposed the approach of the drug companies that impel psychiatry to use classification of disorders through manuals such as DSM-IV and then subject the patient to the recommended drug for that disorder, which he maintained was a form of domination of the patient as the \"other.\""}, {"Title": "Adverse effects associated with physical restraint.", "Abstract": "Restraint use is not monitored in the US, and only institutions that choose to do so collect statistics.

To evaluate this, we retrospectively identified 155 consecutive admissions over an 18-month period to a general acute male psychiatry inpatient unit in a Veterans Affairs Hospital on which all competent patients were offered the opportunity to participate in low-risk clinical research. Male inpatients who did (N=70) and did not consent (N=85) were compared on 17 variables. Patients who consented to research were somewhat younger (M(difference)=4.6 year) and were significantly more likely to carry a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

It is also clear that psychiatric nurses require a greater understanding of the technique if it is to be implemented with greater efficacy within acute psychiatric care."}, {"Title": "A study of patients with spinal disease using Maudsley Personality Inventory.", "Abstract": "We administered the Maudsley Personality Inventory (MPI) preoperatively to 303 patients with spinal diseases about to undergo surgery. Patients younger than 20 years, patients previously treated in the Department of Psychiatry, and patients with poor postoperative results were excluded. Patients with N-scores (neuroticism scale) of 39 points or greater or L-scores (lie scale) of 26 points or greater were regarded as \"abnormal.\" Based on clinical definitions we identified 24 \"problem patients\" during the course and categorized them as \"Unsatisfied,\" \"Indecisive,\" \"Doctor shoppers,\" or \"Distrustful.\" Preoperative MPI categorized 26 patients as abnormal; 22 patients categorized as abnormal became problem patients ( p<0.001). MPI sensitivity and specificity was 84.6% and 99.3%, respectively. Preoperative MPI to patients with spinal disease was found to be useful in detecting problem patients."}, {"Title": "A review of the costs of telepsychiatry.", "Abstract": "S: The issue of whether telepsychiatry is worth the cost or whether it pays for itself is controversial. This study investigated this question by reviewing telepsychiatry literature that focused on cost.\nS: Approximately 380 studies on telepsychiatry published from 1956 through 2002 were identified through MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and cross-referenced bibliographies. Of these, 12 studies with samples of more than ten persons or programs focused specifically on the cost of telepsychiatry.\nThe methods of examining cost used in the 12 studies were cost-feasibility, cost surveys, direct comparison of costs of telepsychiatry and in-person psychiatry, and cost analysis. It was concluded that in seven of the studies reported, telepsychiatry was worth the cost. One study reported that telepsychiatry was not financially viable. Three studies of cost-effectiveness reported the break-even number of consultations, the number that make telepsychiatry comparable in cost to in-person psychiatry. One review concluded that the lack of a clear business plan contributed to the difficulty of determining whether any of the programs was cost-effective.\nS: Telepsychiatry can be cost-effective in selected settings and can be financially viable if used beyond the break-even point in relation to the cost of providing in-person psychiatric services. Whether governmental or private health agencies value telepsychiatry enough to assume its cost is a question that remains to be answered."}, {"Title": "Demographic and practice characteristics of psychiatrists who primarily treat patients with substance use disorders.", "Abstract": "This study examined the sociodemographic and practice characteristics of psychiatrists whose caseloads consist primarily of patients with Substance Use Disorders (SUD). A survey instrument was completed by a random sample of 865 psychiatrists. Study groups were defined as high-SUD providers if psychiatrists reported having 51% or more patients with SUD (n=92) and non-SUD providers as those who reported not having any patients with SUD (n=128). High-SUD providers tended to be younger, more likely to graduate from international medical schools, have larger caseloads, work more hours per week, and have a higher proportion of inpatients and publicly funded patients than non-SUD providers. Results suggest that psychiatrists who primarily treat patients with SUD are in their early careers and treat patients with more clinical, psychosocial, and economic disadvantages. The implications of these findings for psychiatry training programs and policy makers will be discussed."}, {"Title": "Expansion of the consultation-liaison psychiatry paradigm at a university medical center: integration of diversified clinical and funding models.", "Abstract": "The perspective of the contemporary Consultation-Liason Service (CLS) psychiatrist is increasingly one of consultant to medical and surgical colleagues in models other than inpatient medical and surgical units. Simultaneously, the need for a clinically and educationally robust inpatient CLS persists despite funding pressures. The University of California, Davis Medical Center Department of Psychiatry has made use of creative organizational and financial models to accomplish the inpatient CLS clinical and educational missions in a fiscally responsible manner. In addition, the department has in recent years expanded the delivery of psychiatry consultation-liaison clinical and educational services to other models of care delivery, broadening the role and influence of the CLS. Several of the initiatives described in this paper parallel an overall evolution of the practice of consultation-liaison psychiatry in response to managed care influences and other systems pressures. This consultation-liaison paradigm expansion with diversified sources of funding support facilitates the development of consultation-liaison psychiatry along additional clinical, administrative, research, and educational dimensions. Other university medical centers may consider adaptation of some of the initiatives described here to their institutions."}, {"Title": "Narrative strategies in medical discourse: constructing the psychiatric 'case' in a non-western setting.", "Abstract": "The organizing goal of the present study was to analyze and understand the 'discursive presentation' of the Egyptian psychiatric patient through the texts, or narratives, contained within the patient medical charts. It is argued that the medical record, as a written document blending overt medical imperatives with more unexamined cultural assumptions about self-hood and abnormality, is an unusually rich source of discursive data concerning the 'cultural negotiations' implicit in the construction of the patient according to the two (often competing) world views represented by western biomedicine and traditional Egyptian culture. Psychiatry in Egypt is much more than a 'foreign transplant'; to assume this is to deny the culturally constructed nature of western biomedicine and psychiatry, which have their roots in historical and cultural notions of self, society, the individual, and normality versus abnormality (Transcultural Psychiat. 35(3) (1998) 352). Egyptian psychiatry is the product of an ongoing active blending of two very different conceptualizations of these issues."}, {"Title": "Cultural adaptations of current psychiatric classifications: are they the solution?", "Abstract": "Despite the limitations of modern nosological systems the development of cultural adaptations is a step backward, leading to unavoidable pitfalls in spite of the fact that cultural diversity is imposing new attitudes and demands on psychiatrists. Cultural adaptations challenge the principles of the universality of science and of ethics. ICD-10 and DSM-IV rely on the symptoms present to classify psychiatric diseases. This kind of classification has many advantages: it is a theoretical, close to clinical reality, easy to grasp and less prone to untested hypotheses. But they have some drawbacks: they do not say what diseases are, since the concept of symptom is not totally clear in psychiatry. The greatest disadvantage of this approach is the dispersion of disorders that may be related or even unique. Furthermore, when too many symptoms are present, this method requires a hierarchical structure (as in DSM-III)--unless one is willing to live with multiple diagnoses, the so-called co-morbidities (as in DSM-IV). But at other times, too few symptoms are present, leading to atypical, waste-basket and subsyndromal categories. Another problem is that symptoms may not be consistent across cultures, leading to the need of cultural adaptations. In the case of diseases diagnosed according to symptomatic criteria, cultural adaptations of internationally accepted classifications are often sought because symptoms are deemed to be inconsistent across cultures. But at a closer look, very often the symptoms are not so different and it is only the cultural halo which makes them attractive; even when they are particular to a given culture they can easily be interpreted (e.g., the penis invagination of latah). Indeed, they represent a way of experiencing common feelings such as anxiety (e.g., the susto of Latin America, which is a typical panic disorder) and depression. To put too much emphasis on local symptoms bears the risk of yielding to social and cultural pressure."}, {"Title": "Sexual offender commitment in the United States: legislative and policy concerns.", "Abstract": "Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have laws for the special civil commitment of convicted sexual offenders who are about to be released from penal confinement and do not meet criteria for ordinary psychiatric civil commitment. As of summer 2002, nearly 2500 sexual offenders were hospitalized pursuant to one of these laws. An American Psychiatric Association task force declared that \"sexual predator commitment laws establish a non-medical definition of what purports to be a clinical condition without regard for scientific and clinical knowledge,\" and thus \"distort the traditional meaning of civil commitment, misallocate psychiatric facilities and resources, and constitute an abuse of psychiatry.\" It remains unclear how legislatures in states with these laws will respond to the U.S. Supreme Court's 2002 decision in Kansas v.

Sometimes the psychiatric condition is the primary disorder, and the physician's main task is the early identification of the disorder and referral to specialist psychiatric services. On other occasions, the psychiatric condition will need to be addressed in addition to the infectious disease, and the physician aims to treat in conjunction with a psychiatrist. It is rare for referrals to be made from psychiatry to infectious diseases physicians.\nA single case study is used to describe a modification of Danger Ideation Reduction Therapy (DIRT), a novel intervention for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). In our modification the infectious diseases physician plays a key, collaborative role in the psychological treatment of the patient.\nAlthough an uncontrolled trial, results from the modified DIRT protocol are encouraging and warrant replication in a randomised controlled trial.\nA collaborative approach by the infectious diseases physician, the microbiology laboratory and the psychologist can provide a valuable means of retaining patients with OCD in treatment and in the management of this common, disabling condition."}, {"Title": "[Psychological disorders after severe occupational accidents].", "Abstract": "After severe accidents, a significant number of victims develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychiatric disorders, which lead to considerable impairment in work and daily life. Few studies exist which deal with the psychological consequences of industrial accidents. The Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (University of Freiburg) in cooperation with the Department of Trauma Surgery (University of Freiburg) have therefore carried out a prospective study on the subject. 56 victims of an industrial accident were assessed immediately after the accident, and again six months later, using different instruments, e.g. structured clinical interviews (e.g. ADIS). The prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders in the follow-up assessment after six months were 12% PTSD, 11% subsyndromal PTSD (not all criteria of PTSD fulfilled) and 11% other psychiatric disorders. The patients with PTSD and subsyndromal PTSD were compared with the patients with other psychiatric disorders. The accidents of patients with PTSD/subsyndromal PTSD were more serious, and their injuries more severe. In addition, these patients reported that they had thought much more about their work before the accident and believed that their work was much more dangerous than that of patients with other psychiatric disorders. As early as the first day after the accident the patients with PTSD/subsyndromal PTSD were afraid of developing physical and work-related problems as a consequence of the accident. They also reported more symptoms of PTSD and depression and anxiety symptoms. Patients with PTSD/subsyndromal PTSD reported more limitations in daily life and that they were unfit for work for a longer period.

The predictor consists of CASCAP psychopathology variables, motivational and social functioning variables assessed by the therapist. ICD-10-diagnoses had no influence on ILOS. Improvement on MAS axis VI needed longer average LOS than improvement in symptoms. Unchanged patients had shorter LOS than improved ones, the lower limit of effective LOS being more than about 55 days for improvement of symptoms.

Although ERP usefulness as a diagnostic tool is limited due to the complexity of psychiatric diagnosis, which raises theoretical, methodological and ethical problems that cannot be resolved by neurobiological methods, ERP offers relevant information in 3 different topics: the choice of psychotropes in pharmacotherapy; the description and understanding of cognitive processes; the psychotherapeutic relation. 1) Converging arguments from experimental studies support the hypothesis that the amplitude of P300 and CNV as well as the loudness dependence of the auditory N1/P2 response (LDAEP) are regulated by central catecholaminergic and serotoninergic neurotransmission. These systems also are the target of several psychotropes, and therefore the neurophysiological assessment may bring reliable indicators to predict favourable response to psychotropes and drug intolerance. 2) Moreover the assessment of Reaction Times and P300 and VCN parameters, jointly recorded in a single investigation, brings information about the self-organization and self-regulation of cerebral functioning, and might help the clinicians to understand the functional meaning of attentional disorders in Psychiatry. 3) Finally, the discussion of the neurophysiological results with the patient, in comparing objective and subjective data, might help him to better understand his/her difficulties and to modify his/her subjective experience of the disease."}, {"Title": "Case series with late-onset psychosis hospitalized in a geriatric psychiatry unit in Turkey: experience in 9 years.", "Abstract": "In this article we report the first series of Turkish inpatients with late-onset psychosis, and describe our 9-year experience at the only inpatient geriatric psychiatry department in Turkey. Among 420 patients hospitalized between 1993 and 2002, 27 were psychotic. In this group, eight patients were diagnosed as having late-onset schizophrenia (LOS) and six very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (VLOSLP). Five patients had early-onset schizophrenia and eight had delusional disorder. Females were more frequently seen in the group with LOS and the group with VLOSLP. Except for one patient with LOS, all patients with VLOSLP and LOS had paranoid psychosis. Nihilistic delusions, delusions of poverty or guilt, thought withdrawal, thought insertion, and thought broadcasting were not seen in any of the patients.

Evolutionary theory predicts that the relative parental investment of the sexes in their offspring is associated with different mating strategies in males and females. Individuals of the sex that invests more in offspring should be more discriminative in their sexual interactions because the costs of making a poor mate choice are greater for the highest-investing sex. Because in Homo sapiens, as in many other mammal species, the higher-investing sex is the female sex, women are more discriminative in their sexual preferences and less promiscuous than men. Accordingly, the epidemiology of sexual disorders can be expected to reflect sex differences in evolved mating strategies and sexual psychology. Sexual disorders that represent extreme variants of a mating strategy involving greater voluntary control over mate choice, accurate assessment of the quality of potential mates, and a tendency toward sexual restraint should be more prevalent among women. In contrast, sexual disorders that represent extreme variants of a mating strategy involving responsiveness to a variety of sexual stimuli and a tendency toward promiscuity should occur more frequently among men. Clinical data support these predictions."}, {"Title": "Open access to part-time specialist training -- the Swiss experience.", "Abstract": "Gender shift in the medical profession evokes an increasing demand for innovative work and training curricula.

The Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) was also administered to assess general cognition. The percentage of patients who failed each test was calculated. Seventy-two percent failed at least one measure of executive function, whereas only 30% failed the MMSE. The results suggest that impairment of executive function is common among inpatients referred for psychiatric consultation. Because impairment of executive function has been specifically associated with behavioral and functional disability, routine assessment of executive function should be integrated into psychiatric case management."}, {"Title": "The role of peptides in treatment of psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "About 25 years ago the observation that neuropeptides serve as signalling molecules in the nervous system generated great expectations for drug industry. In this article the progress made since then in exploiting neuropeptide systems pharmacologically in psychiatry is highlighted. In affective disorders a number of neuropeptides seem to be causally involved in development and course of illness, especially corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), vasopressin (AVP) and substance P, whose receptors are now targeted with small molecules designed to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms. Although not exactly neuropeptides, also neurotrophins, may have a distinct role in antidepressant action and possibly also in causation of depression. Schizophrenia-like symptoms are caused by neurotensin (NT), supporting the notion that drugs interfering with NT systems are potential antipsychotics. Finally, sleep disorders, currently treated with hypnotics, that have serious adverse effects can be targeted with neuropeptides. According to the work by Axel Steiger several neuropeptides even if peripherally administered produce improvements of quality of sleep. All these observations call for intensified application of novel research tools necessary to exploit the potential of neuropeptide systems as psychopharmaceutical targets."}, {"Title": "[Conception of neurorehabilitation in post-stroke patients].", "Abstract": "Based on the long research and practical experience of specialized neurorehabilitation service study in different Moscow and Russian regions, the article presents the conception of post-stroke patient's neurorehabilitation.

These have ranged from Padraig O'Malley's (1990) fascinating examination of the world of the hunger strikers and their families, to a recent socio-psychological study of sectarianism in young children, which was sponsored by the Community Relations Council (Connolly <i>et al</i>, 2002). The latter careful piece of work demonstrated that while children of three years of age are beginning to identify different cultural symbols, there is not much evidence of sectarian attitudes until about five or six years of age. By this time they have not only begun to recognise and identify with partisan symbols, but also to express deeply antagonistic sectarian attitudes. These are not wholly unexpected findings, but the purpose of good research is to enquire whether things are in fact the way one might expect them to be. When it comes to research on clinical psychiatry there is less material but the most interesting and unexpected finding that emerges from the published work of psychiatrists in Northern Ireland is the limited evidence of any increased violence-related psychiatric illness in the population as a whole."}, {"Title": "Terrorism, human-made and natural disasters as a professional and ethical challenge to psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The consequences of terrorism, wars and natural disasters are a challenge to the psychiatric profession.

The study compares the gross scores (GS) obtained with different MCQ formats, and introduces knowledge score (KS).\nThe study was conducted in the Saudi Council for Health Specialties, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from 1996 to 2002. The mean percentile scores obtained by all postgraduate trainees sitting any Part I or Part II Saudi Board Examination in Psychiatry were subjected to a comparative analysis.\nA total of 110 candidates sat 18 examinations returning 143 papers containing a total of 32,375 MCQ options. Phase 1 generated lowest overall mean GS (47.8%), phase 3 occupied an intermediate position (53.1%) and phase 2 produced the highest score (68.3%). The KS, to the contrary, generated strikingly similar results for all the 3 phases (47.8, 50.5 and 49.5%) indicating that the marked differences in the GS were probably related to benefits obtained from guessing in the absence of negative marking. In this respect, the OBA produced considerably higher KS scores than the T/F, presumably due to its facilitating extra benefits from cueing, partial knowledge and judgement.\nDifferent MCQ formats generate dissimilar quantitative results. The OBA format seems superior to the T/F format in crediting judgement and application of knowledge. In non-negatively marked MCQ tests, the suggested KS provides results comparable to those of negatively marked tests. Pass marks in MCQ tests should be calibrated according to the used format."}, {"Title": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "The introduction of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been a major advance in pediatric psychiatry, while contemporary advances in the understanding of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) phenomenon in children have facilitated its identification and treatment.

The most widely used kind sees perception as dependent on passive inflow from the environment of information that is used to make and process representations of objects and events. A second kind views perception as an active search for information that is inherent in the environment and is extracted by tuned resonances in brain circuits. A third kind holds that perception works by the creation of information through chaotic dynamics by forming hypotheses about the environment, through which learning takes place. Experimental evidence for creative dynamics in brains is briefly sketched. The explanation is offered that brains, being finite systems, work this way in order to cope with the infinite complexity of the world. All that brains can know is the hypotheses they construct and the results of testing them by acting into the environment, and learning by assimilation from the sensory consequences of their actions. The process is described as intentionality. It works through the action-perception-assimilation cycle. The cost of this solution to the problem of infinite complexity by hypothesis testing is the progressive isolation of individuals, as they accumulate their unique experiences through which their personalities form. Socialization and the acquisition of shared knowledge requires the emergence of new personality structure by self-organization through chaotic dissolution of existing the structure, as a prelude to the creation of new traits, habits, and values. Dissolution works in a crisis situation by regression to earlier stages of development, from which a fresh start can be made. A state of malleability emerges in the depth of crisis, in which compassionate companions through loving care can invite cooperative actions. Joint actions support the growth of a new lifestyle based on trust. Socialization requires neurochemical mechanisms of affiliation and bonding that evolved through the requirements of parental care of altricial offspring in mammalian reproduction. These mechanisms are invoked by means of behavioral techniques from cultural evolution. The dynamics, neural mechanisms, behavioral signs, methods of induction, and therapeutic utility of dissolution should be known by therapists. Lack of recognition and understanding may cause failure to use brief windows of opportunity to instill long-term relief of psychic pain by restructuring intentionality in distressed patients."}, {"Title": "Integrative neuroscience.", "Abstract": "A fundamental impediment to an \"Integrative Neuroscience\" is the sense that scientists building models at one particular scale often see that scale as the epicentre of all brain function. This fragmentation has begun to change in a very distinctive way. Multidisciplinary efforts have provided the impetus to break down the boundaries and encourage a freer exchange of information across disciplines and scales. Despite huge deficits of knowledge, sufficient facts about the brain already exist, for an Integrative Neuroscience to begin to lift us clear of the jungle of detail, and shed light upon the workings of the brain as a system. Integrations of brain theory can be tested using judicious paradigm designs and measurement of temporospatial activity reflected in brain imaging technologies. However, to test realistically these new hypotheses requires consistent findings of the normative variability in very large numbers of control subjects, coupled with high sensitivity and specificity of findings in psychiatric disorders. Most importantly, these findings need to be analyzed and modeled with respect to the fundamental mechanisms underlying these measures. Without this convergence of theory, databases, and methodology (including across scale physiologically realistic numerical models), the clinical utility of brain imaging technologies in psychiatry will be significantly impeded. The examples provided in this paper of integration of theory, temporospatial integration of neuroimaging technologies, and a numerical simulation of brain function, bear testimony to the ongoing conversion of an Integrative Neuroscience from an exemplar status into reality."}, {"Title": "Suicidal behavior, satisfaction with life, and perceived social support in end-stage renal disease.", "Abstract": "Suicide has been rarely studied among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients.

The authors sought to develop an updated calendar and to determine if the calendar is consistent with attitudes of residents in various stages of their training.\nA new sociological calendar was developed after conducting a focus group with chief residents. The Osgood Semantic Differential Survey (OSD) was used to measure residents' attitudes, and the results were compared with the modified calendar.\nThe updated calendar differs considerably from Light's original calendar. Findings from the OSD were generally consistent with the updated calendar.\nA modern sociological calendar illustrates the relatively predictable transitions that residents go through over the course of their training. By better understanding these stages of development, supervisors and residency directors may become more effective in their teaching and support efforts."}, {"Title": "Incorporating pain management training into the psychiatry residency curriculum.", "Abstract": "Pain management has received increased attention from the medical community, influenced by societal demands for more effective and comprehensive treatment. In fact, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations requires that physicians consider pain as \"the fifth vital sign.\" It requires that pain severity be documented by using a standardized pain scale. Unfortunately, the assessment and management of pain is difficult. Pain is more than a sensation; it is influenced by emotional, cognitive, and psychosocial factors. The role of the psychiatrist in managing patients with pain has received increasing attention. The American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology now offers a subspecialty certification in Pain Management. While certification is warranted for those who practice extensively in this area, the general psychiatrist should also have familiarity with those issues that are likely to arise in treating patients with pain. Toward this end, the following guidelines are proposed for pain management training to be incorporated into the residency training curriculum."}, {"Title": "Encountering suicide: the experience of psychiatric residents.", "Abstract": "The authors sought to determine how often psychiatric residents encountered completed suicide, how it affected them, and what supports were available and most useful to them.\nPsychiatric residents completed questionnaires about their encounters with completed suicide during residency. Questionnaire items asked about the resident's relationship to the deceased, the impact of the suicide on the resident, what supports were available and useful to residents, and whether residents had received education about suicide. Postgraduate education directors were similarly surveyed about their programs.\nOf 197 respondents, 61.4% had encountered one or more completed suicides during their residency. Of the suicides, 61% were by patients and 16.5% by a colleague, friend, or relative; 22.3% of the residents had encountered both. The most common context was suicide by a patient the resident had seen on call or in consultation; next was suicide by a fellow physician. The greatest impact on residents was on their emotional health, followed by how they assess patients and their medicolegal view of psychiatry. Friends and fellow residents were identified as significant supports. Residents were reluctant to use employee assistance programs, citing confidentiality and insurance issues. Only one-third of residents received education on the impact of suicide on trainees. Postgraduate education directors' responses closely reflected those of residents. Only one-third of postgraduate education directors reported having a policy in place in the event of suicide.\nSuicide is a commonly encountered, stressful event for trainees. Additional supports, education, and policies should be implemented to address this issue."}, {"Title": "Use of the mechanistic case diagramming technique to teach the biopsychosocial-cultural formulation to psychiatric clerks.", "Abstract": "Biopsychosocial-cultural formulation is an essential skill for medical students to become familiar with during their psychiatry clerkship.

The two groups' ratings on the questionnaire items were compared.\nResponse rates were 49.5% and 45.1%, respectively, for the psychiatry and the internal medicine groups. Future psychiatrists did not differ from future internists in sociodemographic characteristics. They rated 13 factors on the questionnaire more positively than did their colleagues who were pursuing internal medicine, and many had chosen psychiatry very early (40% had done so before medical school). Some of the more positively rated factors were experience with mental illness either personally or by a relative or close friend, efficacy of psychiatric treatments, the degree to which psychiatric practice is perceived to be evidence based, research opportunities, and curiosity about the topic of \"madness.\"\nFindings confirm earlier work in North American samples showing a substantial cross-cultural consistency in motives for choosing psychiatry as a discipline.

Transcultural psychiatry has undergone a conceptual reformulation in the last two decades. Having started with a comparative approach, which focused on the diverse manifestations of mental disorders among different societies, it broadened its scope, aiming at present to incorporate social and cultural aspects of illness into the clinical framework. Therefore, transcultural psychiatry now focuses more on what is called the illness experience than on the disease process, the latter understood as illness as it is viewed by health practitioners. Western medicine, of which psychiatry is a part, is grounded in positivist epistemological principles that stress the biological processes of disease. The intention of the paper is to develop an interest in alternative but also complementary ways of thinking. Modern transcultural psychiatry interprets some epidemiological and clinical aspects of major mental disorders (such as schizophrenia and depression) in a different light. However, it also distances itself from the absolute relativism of antipsychiatry, centering on clinical facts and helping clinicians in their primary task of alleviating suffering. An important contribution in addressing this task is the formulation of a cultural axis within the DSM model of multiaxial evaluation. A clinical vignette of a cultural formulation applied to a clinical discussion of a case is described."}, {"Title": "Kandinsky-Clerambault's Syndrome: concept of use for Western psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The aim of our paper is to describe Kandinsky-Clerambault's Syndrome, which has important cultural-historical value in the history of psychiatry, and to illustrate the syndrome by means of a case report. Although its component symptoms are known among Western psychiatrists, the syndrome's specific name is generally unknown.

He is considered the founding father of American neurology and made important contributions in the fields of basic science and the delineation of diseases. He was also a best-selling novelist and a public figure of stature. According to Wilder Penfield, the eminent Canadian neurosurgeon, Mitchell was, for the last three decades of the 19th century, the outstanding psychiatrist in the United States. We examine some aspects of this claim by reviewing briefly what psychiatrists did in Mitchell's day, the role played by neurologists in the treatment of the neuroses and his own particular psychiatric interests. We conclude that, contrary to Penfield's contention, Mitchell never really practiced psychiatry beyond what any generalist of today would consider as being within his or her scope. He was, however, a mentor to the psychiatrists of his time."}, {"Title": "Ritanserin as an adjunct to lithium and haloperidol for the treatment of medication-naive patients with acute mania: a double blind and placebo controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a lifelong episodic condition characterized by mood swings between mania and depression. Several lines of evidence suggest that serotonin is likely to play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. Ritanserin, a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, has been reported to have antipsychotic activity. In this 6-week double blind, placebo controlled study involving moderate to severe manic patients, we assessed the effects of ritanserin plus haloperidol in combination with lithium.\n45 patients aged between 21-43 were eligible to participate as they met the DSM-IV criteria for a current manic episode, on the basis of a clinical interview by an academician psychiatrist. In addition, a score of at least 20 points on the Young Mania rating Scale was required representing moderate to severe mania. Patients were randomly allocated lithium (1-1.2 mEq/L) + haloperidol (10 mg/day)+ ritanserin (10 mg/day) (Group A) or lithium (1-1.2 mEq/L)+ haloperidol (10 mg/day) + placebo (Group B) for a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were assessed by a third year psychiatry resident at baseline and 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 days after the medication started. All patients entered the hospital were not previously under any medication. The mean decrease in the Young Mania Rating Scale score from baseline was used as the main outcome measure of response of mania to treatment. The extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed using the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale. Side effects were systematically recorded throughout the study and were assessed using a checklist.\nYoung Mania Rating Scale total scores improved with ritanserin. The difference between the two protocols was significant as indicated by the effect of group and the between-subjects factor (F = 5.02, d.f. = 1, P = 0.03). The means Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale scores for the placebo group were higher than the ritanserin group and the difference was significant in day 42.

An interdisciplinary challenge for anesthesiology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The choice of anesthetic for electroconvulsive therapy is based on the anesthetic requirements to be met and on the agent's impact on the seizure threshold. Thus, the non-barbiturate anesthesia etomidate revealed properties to enhance the seizure duration. Even though precisely this feature makes etomidate so valuable, little research has been done on the use of etomidate in ECT. The aim of the present study was to compare the barbiturate anesthesia thiopentone with etomidate, with the focus of attention being the quality of seizure. In 13 patients, the paradigm of a single intra-individual crossover anesthesia during maintenance ECT was selected. The excitatory effects and the electroencephalographic changes were described. Furthermore, significant differences in motor seizure duration (26.69 sec +/- 9.7 vs. 35.92 sec +/- 9.2; p < 0.007) and EEG seizure duration (39 sec +/- 14.1 sec vs. 61 sec +/- 22.2 sec; p < 0.0009) were observed. Our results confirm previous findings and reveal that after etomidate the quality of seizure can be improved not only in terms of duration. The growing knowledge of the mode of action of anesthetics/hypnotics from an anesthesiological point of view and the better understanding of subcortical and cortical mechanisms, with particular consideration of the motor seizure threshold, facilitate a differentiated choice of the narcotic and the optimization of short anesthesia in the course of electroconvulsive therapy."}, {"Title": "Electroconvulsive therapy for the depressed elderly.", "Abstract": "Depressive disorder is a common mental disorder in old age, with serious health consequences such as increased morbidity, disability, and mortality. The frailty of elderly may seriously hamper the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy in depressed elderly. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in depressed elderly therefore may be an alternative to treatment with antidepressants.\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of ECT (compared to simulated ECT or antidepressants) in depressed elderly.\nWe searched the CCDANCTR database, Medline 1966-2000, EMBase 1980-2000, Biological abstracts 1985-2000, Cinahl 1982-2000, Lilacs from 1982 onwards, Psyclit 1887-2000, Sigle 1980-2000. The reference lists of relevant papers were scanned for published reports. Hand searching of the Journal of ECT and the Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry was done.

All had major methodological shortcomings; data were mostly lacking essential information to perform a quantitative analysis. Although the O'Leary study concluded that real ECT was superior over simulated ECT, these conclusions need to be interpreted cautiously. Only results from the second trial (unilateral versus bilateral ECT) could be analysed, not convincingly showing efficacy of unilateral ECT over bilateral ECT, WMD 6.06 (CI -5.20,17.32). Randomised evidence on the efficacy and safety of ECT in depressed elderly with concomitant dementia, cerebrovascular disorders or Parkinson's disease is completely lacking. Possible side-effects could not be adequately examined because the lack of randomised evidence and the methodological shortcomings.\nNone of the objectives of this review could be adequately tested because of the lack of firm, randomised evidence.

Individual follow-ups have been called for in order to identify possible treatment deficiencies and to make recommendations for clinical practices. In this study, mortality of long-stay psychiatric patients has been monitored for the years 1992-2000 and contrasted with that prevalent in the general population.\nData on psychiatric patients (N = 253) who were treated without a break for at least 6 months during 1992 in the Department of Psychiatry at Oulu University Hospital were linked with the National Death Register. Standardised mortality rates (SMRs) were determined according to gender, age groups, and different causes of death.\nOf the total study population, 80.2 % had schizophrenia, 5.1 % other functional psychoses, 9.5 % organic mental disorders, 2.4 % personality disorders and 2.8 % mood disorders. Sixty-nine (27.3 %) of the patients (aged 31-88 years) had died before the end of the year 2000. The all-cause death risk for both males and females was four times that of the general population. The mortality risk was over ten-fold for males and almost 30-fold for females in the youngest age group (25-34 years), with suicides explaining about 75 % of these deaths. SMRs were found to decrease at older age, mortality thus approaching that of the general population. Diseases of the circulatory system were the most common single cause of death in both genders and mortality due to that cause exceeding mortality in the general population nearly 3.6-fold. However, the probability of death was highest (SMR 17.5) in connection with diseases of the digestive system. Increased risks of death due to respiratory complications (SMR 9.3), accidents (SMR 5.1) and neoplasms (SMR 2.1) were also noted. The overall death rates did not differ in relation to social class or professional education.\nLong-stay psychiatric patients were found to die from the same natural causes as the rest of the general population. However, the mortality risk of the long-stay psychiatric patients compared with that of the general population was notably higher, despite ongoing improvements in medical care and facilities. Inadequately organised somatic care and the prevailing culture of \"non-somatic\" treatment in psychiatry were suggested to, at least in part, explain this phenomenon. Attention ought to increasingly focus on somatic examinations and various health educational programmes specially designed for psychiatric patients and involving matters like healthy diet, smoking cessation and physical exercise. These practices should be a regular part of any patient's treatment programme. Also, the need to recognise factors associated with a patient's psychiatric disorder that could limit that patient's ability to communicate somatic symptoms and/or even lead to a refusal by that patient to have somatic diseases treated was seen as essential for providers of psychiatric services."}, {"Title": "Notes on antipsychiatry.", "Abstract": "The present paper aims to provide a review of the history and basic principles of the antipsychiatric movement, as well as to discuss the work of its most important theorists. The authors searched recent literature, as well as drawing upon some of the basic antipsychiatric texts. Antipsychiatry emerged as an international movement during the 1960s as part of the historic tumult of the period rather than as a result of the evolution of scientific ideas. Antipsychiatrists radically opposed what they understood as a hospital-centered medical specialty legally empowered to treat and institutionalize mentally disordered individuals. Indeed, many antipsychiatrists argued against the very existence of mental disorders themselves. After the 1970s, the antipsychiatry movement became increasingly less influential, due in particular to the rejection of its politicized and reductionistic understanding of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Buddhism, behavior change, and OCD.", "Abstract": "For individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), the difficulty of their situation comes as no surprise.

Neuroaudiology with electrophysiologic testing, records the electrical activity of the auditory pathways, extending from the 8th cranial nerve up to the cortical auditory centers as a result of external auditory stimuli. Central Auditory Processing Disorders may co-exist with mental disorders and complicate diagnosis and outcome. DESIGN: A MEDLINE search was conducted to search for papers concerning the association between Central Auditory Processing Disorders and mental disorders. The research focused on the diagnostic methods providing the inter-connection of various mental disorders and central auditory deficits. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The medline research revealed 564 papers when using the keywords 'auditory deficits' and 'mental disorders'. 79 papers were referring specifically to Central Auditory Processing Disorders in connection with mental disorders. 175 papers were related to Schizophrenia, 126 to learning disabilities, 29 to Parkinson's disease, 88 to dyslexia and 39 to Alzheimer's disease. Assessment of the Central Auditory System is carried out through a great variety of tests that fall into two main categories: psychoacoustic and electrophysiologic testing. Different specialties are involved in the diagnosis and management of Central Auditory Processing Disorders as well as the mental disorders that may co-exist with them. As a result it is essential that they are all aware of the possibilities in diagnostic procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable evidence exists that mental disorders may correlate with CAPD and this correlation could be revealed through psychoacoustics and neuroaudiology. Mental disorders that relate to Central Auditory Processing Disorders are: Schizophrenia, attention deficit disorders, Alzheimer's disease, learning disabilities, dyslexia, depression, auditory hallucinations, Parkinson's disease, alcoholism, anorexia and childhood mental retardation.

Most cases are intractable because of medication resistance, medication intolerance, or severe medical conditions. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is recognized as one of the most efficacious therapies for catatonic schizophrenia. Thus, we conducted a prospective study of the short-term effect of acute ECT on middle-aged and elderly patients with intractable catatonic schizophrenia.\nSubjects were nine consecutive patients older than 45 years who had fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for catatonic-type schizophrenia and had been referred for first-time acute ECT after other treatments had failed. The patients were treated at Tohoku University Hospital between January 1998 and March 2002. We evaluated the clinical response of these patients to acute ECT by means of the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS). We also evaluated adverse effects of acute ECT.\nThe response rate was 100%. The total BPRS score was improved in all nine subjects at the end of the ECT course and 1 week after the final session in comparison with the total pre-ECT BPRS score (11.9 +/- 7.5 and 9.3 +/- 9.2 versus 57.1 +/- 13.1, respectively, p = 0.008, p = 0.008). The total Global Assessment of Functioning score was also improved significantly (from 10.8 +/- 9.4 just before ECT to 61.6 +/- 18.9 1 week after ECT, p = 0.008).

Drawing on interviews with, and consultations between, 35 patients and 20 general practitioners, we use Kleinman's (Patients and Healers in the context of culture: an exploration of the Borderland between Anthropology, Medicine and Psychiatry, University of California Press Ltd., London) model of the three sectors of health care in order to examine the range of self-treatments people use and the discussion of these treatments in medical consultations. We argue that despite the availability of a range of treatment options and policy changes advocating greater use of self-treatment, patients are inhibited from disclosing prior self-treatment, and disclosure is affected by patients' perceptions of the legitimacy of self-treatment. The findings are in keeping with Cant and Sharma's (A New Medical Pluralism, Alternative Medicines, Doctors, Patients and the State, UCL Press, London) contention that although there has been a pluralisation of \"legitimate\" providers of health care and a restructuring of expertise, biomedicine itself remains dominant."}, {"Title": "Depression in adolescents with diabetes.", "Abstract": "Prevalence and interventions for depression in youth with type 1 diabetes.\nTo explore the co-morbidity of youth with diabetes and psychiatric conditions, and evaluate the relationship of youth with co-morbid depression and diabetes on glycemic control, quality of life, family support, behavioral problems, attributional style, and self-esteem.\nRelevant literature in both child and adolescent populations of psychiatry, psychology, and nursing.\nYouth with type 1 diabetes have significantly higher rates of depression over the general population.

A descriptive and association study was performed, correlating the patient's adjustment and adaptation to the illness to various factors (linear regression techniques and analysis of variance).\nSixty-six per cent of patients presented with psychiatric comorbidity, mainly adjustment disorders (F.43.2), generalized anxiety disorders (F.41.1), and depressive episodes (F.32). Overall adaptation to the illness, however, was satisfactory, showing few repercussions in family or social life, work, or sexual adjustment. Poor adjustment was associated with a dependent personality (Pearson's r = 0.66), antisocial personality (r = 0.39), generalized anxiety (P = 0.003), and depression (P = 0.02).\nThere is a high psychiatric comorbidity in AA (anxiety and mood disorders), requiring systematic psychiatric evaluations of these patients.

Although delirium may develop at any age, the elderly are particularly vulnerable. Since the number of elderly with chronic diseases, dementia, sensory handicaps and the use of several (anticholinergic) medications--all predisposing factors for delirium--is rising, it is essential that general practitioners can recognise, adequately diagnose and treat delirium. This guideline may aid the general practitioner in diagnosing and treating this generally underestimated psychiatric disturbance in somatically ill elderly patients. Evidence on clinical features, differential diagnosis, prevalence, course, aetiology, and risk factors for delirium in primary care is lacking. In general hospitals, the prevalence of delirium in the elderly is about 10-40%; it is probably much less in primary care.

A substantial expansion in research involving older patients is needed to meet the treatment needs of this fast growing group. A critical issue in intervention research is ensuring a patient's decision-making capacity. Considerable heterogeneity exists in this regard even within diagnostic groups. Cognitive changes as well as increased complexity of medication regimens in elderly patients may make it particularly difficult for some older persons to fully understand, appreciate, and/or reason about the risks and benefits of participating in any particular study.\nEmpirical research into assessing and possibly improving decisional capacity is warranted in older people with severe mental illness. Such research may be accomplished through collaborations among specialists from various related disciplines and, importantly, with active involvement of community partners.\nWe present one model of this type of collaboration, the Bioethics Unit of an Intervention Research Center, comprising a multi-disciplinary team along with a Community Advisory Board.\nPreliminary studies in our Center suggest that older individuals with psychotic disorders vary considerably in their decisional capacity, and many subjects appear to be fully capable for consenting to research projects. Furthermore, the patients' level of understanding of the consent material can be improved significantly through repetition and clarification of key elements in the consent form.\nThe decisional capacity for a given research protocol is not necessarily an unmodifiable trait, but can be enhanced with improvements in consenting procedures, even in older persons with psychotic disorders."}, {"Title": "Sex differences in the corpus callosum of patients with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The corpus callosum (CC) has been of interest in schizophrenia research because of its possible role in reduced lateralization and because of its sexually dimorphic characteristics. The literature has been replete with structural brain studies that have yielded equivocal results because of failure to address sex differences, handedness, and overall reductions in total brain volume (TBV) associated with schizophrenia. We performed midsagittal corpus callosum area MRI measurements on 71 chronically ill patients with schizophrenia (52 males, 19 females) and 67 controls (49 males, 18 females) using a semiautomated analytic technique subdividing the corpus callosum into five segments. Consistent with a meta-analysis [J. Neurol., Neurosurg. Psychiatry 58 (1995) 457], reductions in total CC area (after controlling for TBV and age) were found in schizophrenia patients relative to controls. However, our effect size, though not statistically significant, was -0.33 compared to -0.18 for the meta-analysis, indicating greater reductions in total CC area in our group of patients. Statistical significance was achieved only in male patients versus male controls (effect size=-0.50). The effect size remained the same when only right-handers were included in the analysis; thus, handedness did not account for this result.

Self-efficacy refers to an individual's belief that he or she can control important aspects of his or her life. An audit of 67 consecutive clients attending an acute psychiatric day unit was conducted, measuring self-efficacy at admission to the unit and at discharge.\nThe concept of self-efficacy was easily explained to clients, and was measured using a 15-point questionnaire.

Role of general practitioner is crucial; a brief and effective screening method can basically change the present situation. Borson et al (2000) has investigated a new, very brief method named Mini-Cog that consists of the combination of the 3-word recall and the clock-drawing test.\nof the present study was to evaluate this method in Hungarian patient population.\nAuthors have analysed the charts of patients examined by the first author in the outpatient part of the Memory clinic of the National Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in a 2-year interval (between 11.01. 1999 and 31.10.2001). Data of 186 patients were analysed. From the Mini-Mental State the total score, score of three-word recall (possible scores between 0-3), serial counting backward with 7 from 100 were taken into consideration; the clock-drawing test was analysed quantitatively (1 = failure, 2 = borderland, 3 = acceptable solution).\nThe algorithm which considers the patient demented if she or he does not remember of any word, or remembers only of 1-2 and the clock-drawing is pathologic, has a high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (80.9%) in cases using the < or = 24 Mini-Mental State value, while the sensitivity and specificity is 98.8% and 88.0% respectively if drawing the limit at < or = 26 points. Combination of the two tests (word-recall, clock drawing) gives a better value than either of them alone. Based on their experiences they propose to apply in a short test the serial backwards with seven from 100 too, while patients with very high Mini-Mental State scores (29-30) not infrequently can not perfectly solve this subtest (7/11 = 64 p.c.).\nIn agreement with the Hungarian Protocol for diagnosing and treating dementias (1999) authors stress the importance of the consultation with a specialist (neurologist or psychiatrist) in cases of suspected dementia to reveal the underlying disease."}, {"Title": "Liaison psychiatry and referral rates among hospitalized patients.", "Abstract": "The study was conducted to assess the psychiatric co-morbidity among general hospital patients and their rate of referrals.\nA hospital based descriptive observational study.\nThe study was conducted in a private teaching hospital for a period of 6 months.\nAll admitted patients in different disciplines were assessed on a structured proforma supplemented by detailed psychiatric interview on positive cases.

There-as in this paper-we divided the sample into three groups based on a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol dependence (N = 187), alcohol abuse (N = 17), and no diagnosis of alcoholism (N = 61) at baseline assessment. This study reports a three-year prospective longitudinal assessment of the original representative sample of homeless men in Munich.

Of 247 homeless men still alive, at three-year follow-up, 185 (74.9%) were successfully traced and personally interviewed. Alcohol dependency in homeless men at first wave assessment (as compared to men not manifesting alcohol abuse or dependence) was associated with a higher proportion of homelessness at three-year follow-up, an increase of alcohol consumption at three-year follow-up, reduction of monthly income, higher death rate, and high use of general medical services but very low utilization of (specific substance) user treatment services.

The data have been collected from the social welfare register, from a questionnaire sent to Health Districts and via telephone interviews. In addition, the functioning of the treatment system has been studied in detail in one Health District by means of interviews and questionnaires. The general targets set in 1987 giving national priority to focused psychiatric services for adolescents were mostly reached in 2000, and resources for adolescents have increased markedly. In spite of this, minors still have to be treated in adult psychiatric wards. Many problems were detected in the functioning of the chains of treatment for adolescents. The differentiation between primary and secondary care was unclear. Primary care had a limited capacity in the early detection of mental disorders in adolescents. The services for adolescents were broken down into small units. Furthermore, there were no comprehensive future plans. The need for specialized psychiatric services for adolescents is evident.

Many of the patients were ultra-orthodox Jews and the conditions of the interviews often caused them religious concern.

In one previous study of adult female twins, genetic factors accounted for the covariation of liability to a diagnosis of major depressive disorder and liability to lifetime smoking (Kendler, Neale, MacLean, Heath, Eaves, & Kessler, 1993b, Archives of General Psychiatry, 50, 36-43); however, it remained unclear whether genetic effects also account for the covariation between subclinical depressive symptomology and smoking behavior. In this study, we use twin structural equation modeling to explore whether genetic and/or environmental influences contribute to the covariation between depressive symptoms, as measured by the CES-D, and current and lifetime smoking status among 120 monozygotic and 114 dizygotic Caucasian male twin pairs (aged 59-69). In this sample, depressive symptoms showed small but significant correlations with current and lifetime smoking status. Univariate twin analyses indicated that additive genetic and non-shared environmental factors contributed significantly to liability to current and lifetime smoking. However, the majority of variance in CES-D scores was attributable to non-shared (individual) environment. In bivariate analyses, non-shared environmental factors accounted for the majority of covariation between liability to depressive symptoms (CES-D scores > or = 8; above the 75th percentile) and liability to current and lifetime smoking status. Taken together with the previous literature, these results suggest that the etiology of covariation among depressive symptoms and smoking behavior may vary by measurement and severity of depressive symptomology."}, {"Title": "From damaged nerves to masked depression: inevitability and hope in Latvian psychiatric narratives.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric language in Latvia has been invaded by the diagnosis of depression and masked depression. Depression has been promoted by the translation into Latvian of the International Classification of Diseases and by conferences organized by pharmaceutical companies and aimed at educating psychiatrists and family doctors about the new diagnostic categories. The language of depression represents a radical departure from older languages of somatic distress that were central both to Soviet Psychiatry and to lay conceptualizations of distress. However, the new practitioners who favour the diagnosis of depression have a highly atomistic and culture blind approach to patients' problems. In order to selectively cleanse the presentation of distress, various strategies for eliminating social context and suppressing patients' narratives are used during psychiatric consultations. Alongside these imported psychiatric languages, recognition of the physically and socially embedded nature of human experience and its historicity persist. Not all psychiatrists eliminate subjective narrative from the consultation dialogue. However, prioritizing mental over physical states is not linked in a straightforward way to other dualisms such as the intentional versus the accidental and the voluntary versus the involuntary. For many depressed patients autonomy is restricted to being a good patient and learning about their condition. Conversely, psychiatrists who start out by addressing their patients' physical discomfort may move on to open up a range of narrative possibilities."}, {"Title": "Removal of short-term isolation stress differentially influences prepulse inhibition in APO-SUS and APO-UNSUS rats.", "Abstract": "Epidemiological studies have reported that the risk of developing schizophrenia increases with the number of genes one shares with patients suffering from schizophrenia [Gottesman Schizophrenia Genesis, New York: Freeman; 1991]. In addition, stressful life events are known to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia [Schizophr Res 30 (1998) 251] resulting in the stress hypothesis of schizophrenia. Remarkably, stress increases the release of dopamine and noradrenaline in the nucleus accumbens [Brain Res 554 (1991) 217], which links the stress hypothesis with the known dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. Additionally an increased dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens (Nacc) is known to disturb prepulse inhibition (ppi) [Pharmacol Biochem Behav 49 (1994) 155], a phenomenon observed in, among others, schizophrenics [Arch Gen Psychiatry 47 (1990) 181]. Some years ago we have genetically selected two rat-lines which are marked by a high (APO-SUS) and by a low (APO-UNSUS) apomorphine susceptibility. Similar to schizophrenics the APO-SUS rat-line shows a reduced ppi [J Neurosci 15 (1995) 7604]. However, these data were obtained after a period of mild stress, namely a 24-h period of social isolation. Mild stress changes the line specific differences of APO-SUS and APO-UNSUS rats. The stress pushes the APO-SUS rat in the direction of an APO-UNSUS and vice versa, especially as far as it concerns the dopamine and noradrenaline activity in the nucleus accumbens [Cools AR, van-den Bos R, Ellenbroek BA, Gaiting function of noradrenaline in the ventral striatum: its role in behavioural responses to environmental and pharmacological challenges. In: Willner P, Scheel-Kruger J, editors. The mesolimbic dopamine system: from motivation to action.

In: Pea G (Ed.), The basal ganglia IV, New York: Plenum Press; 1994; Brain Res Bull 24 (1990) 49; Behav Neurosci 108 (1994) 1107]. Therefore, in the present paper we investigated the ppi response in non-stressed, i.e. non-isolated APO-SUS and APO-UNSUS rats. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found that removal of the stress led to an increase of ppi in the APO-SUS, but a decrease in the APO-UNSUS. These data clearly shows that the ppi is stress-dependent in APO-SUS and APO-UNSUS rats. It is suggested that the differential stress-induced change in the dopaminergic and the noradrenergic system influences the reaction of APO-SUS and APO-UNSUS rats on ppi."}, {"Title": "[Patients' perspective on the quality of informed consent into psychopharmacological treatment in schizophrenia and depression].", "Abstract": "Respect for autonomy and the right to self-determination require informed consent of patients before any medical procedure.

As in other countries, depression is one of the most prevalent diagnoses in adolescents in Hungary.\nThe present study was designed to determine (a) whether there are specific symptoms to differentiate between two clinical samples of depressed children: patients expressing suicidal behaviour and their peers with no suicide attempts, and (b) if there are significant differences between parents' and adolescents' reports of the same symptoms.\nUsing a recently developed semi-structured interview (Diagnostic Evaluation Schedule for Children and Adolescents-Hungarian version, ), 132 symptoms were assessed for two clinical groups of depressed adolescents: a suicidal group (N=54) [corrected], and a non-suicidal group (N=78) [corrected]. The suicidal group had all made an unsuccessful suicide attempt and/or had had frequent suicidal thoughts during the 6 months prior to the study. The non-suicidal group had neither attempted suicide, nor had had suicidal thoughts during the previous 6 months. All cases were selected from a larger sample of 490 consecutively referred new outpatient children over a 1 year period in five psychiatric facilities in Hungary. Only 13-17-year-old adolescents participated in the study. Both samples were identified using operationalised computer algorithm criteria of DSM-IV major depressive disorder episode (MDD) irrespective of the current clinical diagnosis of the patients. The Pearson Chi-square test with Monte Carlo correction was used to evaluate the differences between the suicidal and the non-suicidal depressed samples.\nHopelessness, negative self-esteem and violent behaviour were the only significant discriminators between the two study groups according to the parent interviews, with increased problem scores in the suicidal sample compared to the non-suicidal sample. Suicidal depressed adolescents view themselves as more depressed and violent than do non-suicidal depressed individuals and were less anxious about their parents.\nThe two depressed samples (suicidal vs. non-suicidal individuals) have only very few dissimilarities. There are, however, some essential differences between the parental and adolescent perceptions of the suicidal and depressive symptoms of the adolescent.

The International Organization for Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry was formed to facilitate this process. It has identified challenges that are universal, and which if not met rapidly and efficiently will damage our ability to provide appropriate care for the patients whom we serve."}, {"Title": "Consultation-liaison psychiatry in Korea.", "Abstract": "The Korean Psychosomatic Society, our national organization for consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatry was formed within the Korean Neuropsychiatric Association (KNPA) in 1992. Since then, there has been increasing interest in C-L activities in general hospitals. All psychiatry departments in university teaching hospitals offer C-L experiences as part of the rotation for residents. Recently, there have been increasing research activities in C-L psychiatry. However, there are some current obstacles to further development of C-L psychiatry. No reimbursement for C-L activities is one of the most pressing problems facing C-L psychiatrists. Insufficient staffing at C-L services and stigmatization of mental illness are also problems to be dealt with. In order to resolve those issues, a more organized approach to demonstrate the usefulness of psychiatric C-L activities will be needed."}, {"Title": "Current status of general hospital psychiatry in Japan.", "Abstract": "The current status of general hospital psychiatry was overviewed to clarify the progress and the stagnation. To facilitate well-organized community psychiatric care, general hospital psychiatry should play a central role in psychiatry. The policy makers of the Japanese mental health system should place a special emphasis on general hospital psychiatric beds to further process of shifting from a hospital based to a community based psychiatry system. It is also necessary that general hospital psychiatry should become more aggressively involved in community psychiatry, e.g. emergency psychiatry. Consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatry has been quickly developed and become one of the main psychiatric fields. For further development, a multidisciplinary team approach with co-medical staffs is necessary to supply efficient and effective care to medically ill patients. A proactive model of C-L care rather than a doctors' needs model should also be considered. Well designed research evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of C-L activities in medical settings needs to be done to increase funding to general hospital psychiatry. This research evidence would also lead to a more fully integrated general hospital psychiatry into the practice of medicine and catch up with the ongoing medical reform in Japan."}, {"Title": "The role and therapeutic potential of 5-HT-moduline in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The endogenous neuropeptide, 5-HT-moduline, selectively and allosterically interacts with 5-HT(1B) receptors. By binding at a site distinct from that bound by 5-HT, 5-HT-moduline induces structural changes in 5-HT(1B) receptors or stabilizes a particular conformation of these receptors. These conformational changes ultimately lead to the prevention of 5-HT binding resulting in desensitization of these receptors and reduction of the serotonergic function. The efficacy of 5-HT(1B) receptor agonists, for example, has been shown to be reduced by this peptide in vitro and behaviorally. In addition, 5-HT-moduline increases 5-HT release, which is regulated by presynaptic 5-HT(1B) autoreceptors. The release of 5-HT-moduline itself is increased after acute restraint stress in rats, whereas deactivation of 5-HT-moduline by specific antibodies in mice prevents the development of anxiety in a classic behavioral model, suggesting a potential role of the peptide in the control of anxiety. It is thus hypothesized that agents inhibiting the effect of 5-HT-moduline could have anxiolytic activity. Because the serotonergic activity is known to play a key role in psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, compounds capable of mimicking or inhibiting the activity of 5-HT-moduline can represent novel antidepressants or anxiolytics."}, {"Title": "A collaborative study of the emergence and clinical features of the major depressive syndrome of Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "This report provides a description of the prevalence and clinical features of the major depressive syndrome of Alzheimer's disease using data derived from structured diagnostic assessments of 243 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and 151 nondemented elderly comparison subjects.\nSubjects were characterized by a consortium of four Alzheimer's disease research centers and the Geriatric Psychiatry Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health. All sites administered the Clinical Assessment of Depression in Dementia, a structured, anchored diagnostic interview that was developed to reliably diagnose and characterize major depressive episodes in this population.\nDespite the use of a common, reliable methodology for the assessment and diagnosis of major depressive episodes, the prevalence of major depression in Alzheimer's disease ranged widely from 22.5% to 54.4% across the recruitment sites. The prevalence of major depressive episodes among Alzheimer's disease patients in the aggregate sample exceeded that for elderly comparison subjects and reached nearly 50% among the most severely demented patients. Alzheimer's disease patients with a current major depressive episode had earlier mean ages at onset, a higher mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score, and were more likely to be experiencing psychotic symptoms than those who had not developed a major depressive episode. Although the major depressive episodes of Alzheimer's disease patients and nondemented elderly comparison subjects included similar numbers of depressive symptoms, patients with Alzheimer's disease were more likely to report a diminished ability to concentrate or indecisiveness and less likely to experience sleep disturbances and feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt during their major depressive episodes. None of the clinical features of major depression differed significantly in frequency among depressed Alzheimer's disease patients with mild, moderate, or severe dementia. Concurrent psychotic symptoms progressively increased with dementia severity.\nThe high rate of major depressive episodes that occur after the onset of cognitive impairment among patients with Alzheimer's disease (the majority of whom had no premorbid history of major depression), common emergence in the early stages of dementia when symptoms of cognitive impairment are least likely to contribute to the syndromal diagnosis of major depression, and differences in the clinical presentations of the major depressive episodes of Alzheimer's disease patients and nondemented elderly comparison subjects, all support the validity of the major depressive syndrome of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest that the major depressive syndrome of Alzheimer's disease may be among the most common mood disorders of older adults."}, {"Title": "Characterization and functional significance of glucocorticoid receptors in patients with major depression: modulation by antidepressant treatment.", "Abstract": "Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis in patients with major depression is one of the most consistent findings in biological psychiatry. Experimental data support the idea that glucocorticoid-mediated feedback via glucocorticoid receptors (GR) is impaired in major depression. The aim of the present work was to assess the putative changes in GR density of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a group of patients with major depression and to determine modulation of these GR sites by antidepressant treatment. In addition, susceptibility of PBMCs to glucocorticoid effects was also studied using a functional end-point analysis in vitro, such as cortisol inhibition of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation. Cortisol levels were also measured before and after dexamethasone suppression test (DST). The results showed a decrease in GR density in depressed patients compared with healthy subjects, mainly in those patients that showed basal cortisol levels in the upper normal range and were refractory to DST. Regarding the functional significance of this variation, two representative groups emerged from our study: a) free-medication patients with GR function comparable to healthy controls, and b) patients showing diminished GR activity. These results suggest a lack of relationship between GR density and cortisol-induced inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation. Patients treated with different antidepressant drugs showed a marked increase in the number of GR sites per cell compared to non-treated. Interestingly, this increase was even higher than in normal subjects. Hence, restoration of GR density after an efficient antidepressant treatment could be an index of an effective modulatory action of drugs on GR expression and highlights the possibility that GR levels might be used as markers of a successful treatment."}, {"Title": "Subspecialty certification in geriatric psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The authors describe the development of certification and recertification processes for geriatric psychiatry, the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology's second subspecialty in psychiatry.\nAuthors referenced databases of the certifying organizations and consulted published surveys of examinees.\nSince the first certification examination was administered in 1991, 2,595 certificates have been awarded.

Sixty-five percent first developed interest in geriatric psychiatry during their residency years (the majority during their PGY1 or PGY2 year). The timing of individualized teaching exposure, as well as lectures in geriatric psychiatry, was associated with the development of first interest in the field. The most important influences on the development of interest in the field included specific teacher attributes, training experiences, personal experiences with seniors, and characteristics cited as unique to geriatric psychiatry, such as the medical, neuropsychiatric, and multifactorial nature of the field. Patient personal histories and outcomes, as well as non-educational experiences with seniors and cultural attitudes, also contributed to interest.\nIt behooves geriatric psychiatry programs to create exemplary educators and commit them to teaching in the early years of general psychiatry programs as well as in medical school.

After reviewing how psychiatry has historically addressed homelessness and mental illness, the authors discuss the roles that the profession has developed in working with homeless populations. These roles, which encompass clinical, administrative, academic, and advocacy functions, have evolved as a result of trends both in homelessness services and within the profession of psychiatry. Challenges implicit in this evolution are discussed, including recent trends in homelessness, particularly an increase in prevalence, especially among families and children and some clinical subpopulations. The authors propose that these epidemiological trends are affecting the mental health care needs of homeless people. To be effective and credible in continuing to help solve the problems of homeless people with psychiatric disorders, psychiatry must adapt to these new challenges, using the roles it has developed."}, {"Title": "[How evidence-based is medicine? A systematic literature review].", "Abstract": "In the early 1990es, it was supposed that only 10-15 per cent of medical interventions were based on results from randomised controlled studies. A systematic review of available empirical studies on the topic was performed in order to elucidate to what extent interventions in different medical specialities are evidence-based.\nLiterature search in MEDLINE for the period 1995-2002 retrieved 15 published studies, which investigated to what extent interventions in individual patients were based on randomised controlled studies. The retrieved papers were read critically in order to extract data concerning the patients, their clinical problems, and the interventions performed. Finally, the classification of the clinical scientific methods, which was the evidence-base of the interventions, were extracted.\nIn general internal medicine over 50 per cent of the interventions seems warranted by randomised controlled studies, whereas the figures are somewhat lower for general practice, surgery, and dermatology. A small study shows that psychiatry may candidate for the top score with 65 per cent of the interventions based on randomised controlled studies. However, more studies are requested to confirm this finding.\nIt is suggested to perform regular studies of the evidence-base for clinical interventions in different specialities, preferably with assistance from colleagues from other specialities. There should be sufficient access to literature databases and databases of \"digested\" evidence, which was not always the case in the reviewed studies. It is important that the indication for an intervention has been evaluated in randomised controlled studies, which compared a possible intervention to observation without treatment or treatment with placebo--a mere comparison in randomised controlled studies of two active interventions may not be sufficient evidence. Authors are encouraged to agree on a comparable classification scale for grading the evidence in publications. It is concluded that there is a need for this kind of regular audit in order to safeguard that patients are offered interventions based on the best evidence."}, {"Title": "[Transcranial magnetic stimulation].", "Abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) allows non-invasive study and modulation of cortical excitability in humans. Changes in cortical excitability in physiological and pathological conditions can be tracked by measurements such as motor threshold, motor evoked potentials, recruitment curves, intracortical facilitation and inhibition. The central motor conduction time can estimate neural transmission in central motor pathways. Changes in areas of representation in sensorimotor cortex can be studied with cortical mapping. Modulation of cortical processing can be used to evaluate different brain functions. Therapeutic use in depression, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy has raised great interest over the past decade. Non-invasive cortical mapping may be achieved by combining TMS to other neurophysiological/ neuroimaging techniques.

These are inventiveness, capacity for language, curiosity, and self-reflection or self-analysis. Some would counterargue that none of these features are \"unique\" to humans. Examples would be given of animal \"intelligence\" involving at times surprising problem-solving abilities. Even \"conversations\" between humans and parrots might be cited. However, this is to misunderstand what the focus is in the article. This is not a thesis on the continuity or discontinuities of evolution. Every well-trained biologist learns about evolution and understands that the most complex human traits have some hint of related traits in nearest relatives. Rather, the emphasis of this article has been to select and emphasize certain distinctive aspects of human behavior that are the most important features distinguishing human \"uniqueness.\" Uniqueness may be quantified by the number and complexity of processes within the four attributes presented in this article. While this may be an interesting mathematical exercise, the author would rather take it for granted that the outcome would be that humans are significantly more complex in each of the four features referred to than the great apes. For those in the mental health field, one would hope that this overview of the most highly evolved systems in human brain may provide a useful framework where creative therapeutic processes can be applied to the ultimate beneficiary, the client or patient. This article proposes that psychosis can be considered the impossibility of conflict resolution among the special neuronal assemblies that separately mediate feelings of attachment versus abandonment, security versus anxiety, calmness versus anger, fulfillment versus helplessness, and satisfaction of sexual needs. Given this model, the role of the therapist is to consider whether the client is in touch with the various equilibrium points in their current life situation or crisis. A questionnaire designed to help access information on these internal states may work better than an oral interview because it forces the client to reflect. How much conflict does the client feel in sorting out personal priorities? Does the client have any practice at resolving internal conflicts? If unpracticed, is the client likely to act out in destructive ways to self or others to resolve the pressure of internal conflicts? I am sure that we can all think of current well-publicized destructive acts in which one has to wonder precisely what model of mind the psychotherapists were using to assist the client. At a higher level, each human has the potential to be creative. Whether expressed as curiosity about the universe and nature or inventiveness, as in improving the quality of one's life or by the use of gifted language as in art and music, the therapist needs to determine how to assist the client into these kinds of self-defined fulfillments, which one hopes will reduce the other tensions of conflict resolution. There is no doubt that the journey for both the client and therapist will be challenging. Ultimately, the journey is the reward for both the client and therapist. In closing, the following quotation seems appropriate. Sydney Brenner (2002), a pioneer in molecular biology, reviewed a current book on the Science, Politics, and Ethics of the Human Genome Project (Sulston and Ferry 2002). He states, \"What I found interesting in the account is that Sulston doesn't tell us anything about the genomes he has sequenced. What did he find there that excited him? What did he learn about genes, about life, about evolution, about worlds to come?

Board Certification System of Psychiatry There was a heated debate about \"Postgraduate Psychiatric Education and Board Certification of Psychiatry\" in the annual meeting for the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology held in Nagasaki in 1968 and in Kanazawa in 1969. The oppositions of young psychiatrists were as follows; 1) Issues of low cost of medical expense as government politics, social protect politics from psychiatric patients, and improper management of patients in mental hospitals should be dealt before making Board Certification System of Psychiatry. 2) Management of the Society of Psychiatry and Neurology dissatisfies many psychiatrists. Board Certification Systems started in many medical societies from 1969 to 1987. Main nine departments except psychiatry started the system. In 1987, the Japan Association of Chairmen of Department of Psychiatry of Medical Colleges (JACDPM) proposed a program for a postgraduate course. The Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology (JSPN) formed the Committee on Psychiatric Education in 1987 and Working Group on Accreditation Program (WGAP) in 1991 under the Committee of Psychiatric Education. After intensive discussions on the Board certification, the WGAP reported a summary of their discussions in 1994. The essence of the WGAP recommended model for the Board of Association was as follows: Minimal Requirements Outline Training Period--three years psychiatric training after two years primary care experience by rotation through other departments. Field of Training--WGAP recommended that post-graduate training should be given at different kinds of institutes such as the department of psychiatry in medical schools, mental hospitals, out-patient mental clinics, community experiences in rehabilitation, day care, social clubs and health centers. Assessment--both oral examination and case reports are requested for evaluation and board certification. Re-evaluation every five years is required. However, there have been the following opinions and the Board Certification System has not been realized. 1) Making improvement in mental hospital is more important than starting Post-graduate Training and Organization for Board Certification of Psychiatry System (PTOBCP). 2) Starting PTOBCP makes professors in department of psychiatry in medical colleges give great power to suppress the right of personal management. 3) Financial support for postgraduate trainee and trainer is insufficient. Medical and psychiatric situations have changed from 2001 to 2002. 1) A neutral organization instead of academic societies will make Board Certification System in each department in the future. 2) Postgraduate educational rotation system (two years) will start in 2004. 3) Advertisement of being certificated by the Board has been possible. In recent situation, necessity for making of PTOBCP is increasing and many members of JSPN long to make it. In the 98th annual meeting, 2002 it was decided to make PTOBCP. 2.

In accordance with overall reorganization of legal systems after the Meiji Restoration in 1968, the Criminal Law of 1880 stipulated criminal responsibility, ruling that \"a person, who was unable to discriminate right and wrong because of loss of mental capacity at the time of committing crime, shall not be punished.\" Article 39 of the current Criminal Law, which was enacted in 1907, redefined criminal responsibility, to say that \"an incompetent person shall not be punished; a person with diminished competence shall be given a mitigation of punishment.\" Meanwhile, the Law for the Custody for Insane Persons of 1900, which was the first law dealing with the mentally ill, aimed to establish strict regulations with regard to the custody of the insane. However, neither of these laws did not provide any procedures for subsequent management of persons acquitted because of insanity.

Surveys have been performed 1997 (25) and 2000. Appr. 50% came from grammar schools in the County of Funen, 20-25% from other counties in Southern Denmark, i.e. Southern Jutland, and 15% from Copenhagen or from Northern Jutland. In the 1990'es more came from Northern Jutland.\nThe duration of the medical study increased from a modus of 6-7 years in the 1970'es to a modus of 7-8 years since 1980. About 45% became general practitioners after four to 25 years (median 14 years), one third of them in the County of Funen, and another third in Southern Jutland. In the 1997 survey 25% became consultants after 11-17 years (median 14 years), in the 2000 survey it increased to 35% after 11-25 years (median still 14 years). The cumulated death rate was 7% for the ages 30-58 years, significantly lower than that of the general population. At twenty years after graduation 85% were medical specialists, at ten years the rate was 40%. Education in anaesthesiology, ophthalmology, oto-rhino-laryngology, and oncology took less than ten years, general medicine 12 years, and 15 years for internal medicine and even longer for surgery, paediatrics, and psychiatry.\nThe medical school, Odense, recruits 82% of its students from Southern Denmark. Of the graduates since 1975 who became general practitioners two thirds have settled in Southern Denmark, of the consultants one half. It is not yet possible to predict when new surveys will be feasible. This article is a continuation of the study of the first survey published in Ugeskr Laeger 2000;162:1547-51 (25)."}, {"Title": "Does 'like predict like' when patients discharged from high secure hospitals re-offend? An instrument to describe serious offences.", "Abstract": "The statement that past behaviour is the best predictor of future behaviour has empirical support in respect of whether an individual will, or will not, commit a criminal offence. People who have offended in the past are more likely to offend in the future. The aims of this study were to develop an instrument and to examine whether the same statement applies in respect of the nature and circumstances of successive offences committed by the same person.\nA rating instrument to describe seven variables relating to the nature and circumstances of a serious offence, the SODI, was developed by the authors. Inter-rater reliability was measured when the instrument was applied to 80 offences committed by 40 patients leaving high secure hospitals. The data were examined for evidence of similarity in the nature and circumstances of successive offences.\nFor five of the seven items of the instrument the kappa coefficients for inter-rater reliability were > 0.65. No significant associations, in terms of SODI ratings, were found between the offence that led to hospital admission and that which was committed after discharge.\nThe SODI is a reliable instrument for the description of serious offences committed by this group. Risk assessments in psychiatry should be informed by an awareness that in only a proportion of cases will the nature and circumstances of any serious re-offence resemble the nature and circumstances of the offence which contributed to a patient's admission to hospital."}, {"Title": "Social change, globalization and transcultural psychiatry--some considerations from a study on women and depression.", "Abstract": "Transcultural psychiatry, whose scientific founder Emil Kraepelin is considered as, in its 100 years of tradition has not only developed a varied range of methods but has also brought about a change in the respective scientific questions as well as in related research and clinical applications. Whereas transcultural research on the psychopathology of depression contributed to the further development of psychiatric nosology, transcultural psychiatry has recently been increasingly faced with issues concerning phenomena of social change and globalization. One region, where such conditions can be observed in particular is Africa, where the dissolving of traditional standards and support systems and growing economic insecurity causes a considerable burden especially on women. As an example, results from a cross-sectional study on East African women using a two step design as well as qualitative and quantitative, standardized psychiatric methods are discussed concerning the association of social change, psycho-social risk factors and the development of depressive disorders.

The rapid growth of telemedicine in this rural, economically disadvantaged state is largely attributable to collaborative development and the service activities of the Maine Telemedicine Services division of a rural community health center, HealthWays/Regional Medical Center at Lubec (RMCL). Annual clinical uses of the system across a broad array of interactive videoconferencing applications currently exceed 1,000 instances for institutional telemedicine and 800 instances for home telehealth. The major applications include mental health/psychiatry, endocrinology/diabetes management, primary care, specialty pediatrics, genetics, and dermatology. Primary care usage derives from a relatively novel use of a mobile telemedicine boat to serve small islands off mid-coastal Maine. Strong future growth is expected in prison telemedicine, emergency medical triage, and nontraditional services such as video relay interpretive services for the deaf, domestic violence advocacy and legal services, and case management for community reintegration of juvenile offenders. The relative success of the two large networks managed by RMCL's Maine Telemedicine Services is evident from the criteria that system usage (1) addresses defined clinical needs, (2) has demonstrable organizational support, (3) is accepted by physicians and patients, (4) exhibits measurable cost and clinical benefits, and (5) is moving toward sustainable operations.

Gehirn und Seele, a discourse authored by Flechsig in 1894, is the focus of this analysis. The author believes that the links between the intellectual production of both German-speaking neurologists have been underrated to this day and attempts to establish that the early Freudian approach to many key issues in the history of psychoanalysis--dreams, unconscious processing, and drives, to name a few--was not unique but shared with some distinguished colleagues in neuropathology and psychiatry. Thus, he attempts to shed additional light on the transition from state-of-art neurology in the last decade of the 19th century to the creation of psychoanalysis as a discipline on its own."}, {"Title": "Reconsidering the classification of schizophrenia and manic depressive illness--a critical analysis and new conceptual model.", "Abstract": "The idea of 'disease entity' in psychiatry and the nosologic map of insanity with the distinction between dementia praecox (schizophrenia since Bleuler 1911) and manic depressive insanity, originally developed by Emil Kraepelin (1986), is an important landmark in the history of psychiatry (Jablensky 1995). This classification, however, has been vigorously debated throughout the years, and new evidence emerging from epidemiological, clinical, genetic and biological research demonstrates that the two nosological categories have distinct features as well as share many similarities in their risk factors, genetic predisposition, brain pathology, neurophysiology, clinical phenomenology and response to treatment, thus raising questions about the validity of the categorical classification of psychoses. In this paper we examine some of the similarities and differences between schizophrenia and bipolar illness emerging from recent biological and clinical research and attempt to clarify major inherent logical contradictions in the application of the 'disease' model of psychiatric diagnosis to the categorical classification of schizophrenia and bipolar illness. Then we examine how similar predicaments have been resolved in other natural classification systems, namely the biological classification of species and the periodic table of the elements. Finally we propose a hypothetical conceptual approach to the classification of psychoses that has been greatly informed by the organizing principle underlying the periodic table of the elements, and is distinct from the 'disease' model of psychiatric classification."}, {"Title": "[Homicide on first day after commitment to the closed ward of psychiatric clinic--report of a successful rehabilitation against all odds].", "Abstract": "The Swiss penal code provides quite a sophisticated system of rules concerning the assessment and management of mentally ill offenders--there is, however, a substantial lack of treatment places.

The current shortage of psychiatrists will increase over the next several decades, resulting in the need to train primary care physicians in basic psychiatric care and the use of non-physician mental health professionals to administer time-intensive, formal psychotherapies. The juxtaposition of these two trends-an increasing scientific influence on the clinical practice of psychiatry and fewer psychiatrists to deliver that treatment-is cause for changes in the approach to psychiatric education. In addressing these issues, the authors suggest that (1) psychiatry should be more integrated into undergraduate medical education in both basic science and clinical curricula, (2) residents in primary care disciplines should have more direct exposure to psychiatric training, (3) joint instructional experiences involving psychiatry and primary care residents should be encouraged, (4) psychiatry residency programs should maintain flexibility in order to incorporate rapid advances in diagnostic procedures and treatments into residency training, (5) research experience should be integrated into psychiatry residency programs, and (6) departments of psychiatry must develop the leadership and expertise necessary to implement the incorporation of rapidly advancing scientific discoveries into the psychiatric curriculum."}, {"Title": "[Panic disorders and agoraphobia: Freudian concepts and DSM IV].", "Abstract": "This paper refers to the relationship between panic and agoraphobia, regarding Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia (DSM IV), from two different points of view coming from Psychoanalysis and Psychiatry.

For any given distribution in the control arm, there is a family of true distributions in the intervention arm for which the most powerful test is a comparison of arithmetic means. Similar results hold for a comparison of geometric means, and approximately for the Wilcoxon rank sum test and a comparison of medians. We discuss how these methods could be used in planning the analysis of a clinical trial in which the intervention effect alters the shape of the distribution. These ideas are illustrated by a trial in community psychiatry, where the primary outcome (days in hospital) was highly skewed but the intervention was mainly expected to reduce the frequency of values in the tail.

Although DPD has unique features, the authors argue that this diagnosis can largely be subsumed under dysthymic disorder. As a result of diagnostic confusion, and of the small amount of research conducted in this area, recommendations for the assessment and treatment of DPD are necessarily speculative. The authors conclude that if personality disorders are maintained as categoric constructs, DPD may best be understood as a subtype of dysthymic disorder.

On the other hand, the person who was biologically a man asking to have his sex changed in the registry, constituted a prototype of the syndrome, complying entirely with all the characteristics that defined transsexualism. And, lastly, those who intervened in this legal process, (lawyer, judge and magistrate), were shown to be profoundly human in the face of this medical and legal enigma.

The subjects were rated by clinicians on depressive symptomatology (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), and anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), and completed self-report measures of Hypochondriacal worry (7-item version of the Whiteley Index), the Somatosensory Amplification Scale, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Multivariate models tested the independent contribution of each of the scales to the level of somatic symptoms as measured by a modified version of the SCL-90 somatization scale. At the bivariate level, somatic symptoms were associated with female gender and lower educational level, as well as the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety scales, the Whitely Index, and the Somatosensory Amplification and Alexithymia scales. In multiple regression models incorporating all variables, female gender and higher scores on the anxiety, somatosensory amplification and alexithymia scales all made independent contributions to the level of somatic symptoms and accounted for 54% of the variance. Therefore, somatic symptoms in depression are related to concomitant anxiety, tendency to amplify somatic distress, and difficulty identifying and communicating emotional distress.

Distress syndromes are common, but classifications fail to differentiate syndromes relevantly. We sought to take a fresh look at the common distress syndromes in the medically ill.\n312 medical inpatients were interviewed using a structured psychiatric interview [the Monash Interview for Liaison Psychiatry (MILP)] to elicit the presence of mood, anxiety and somatoform symptoms. A previously reported examination of these data using latent trait analysis revealed the dimensions of demoralization, anhedonia, autonomic anxiety, somatoform symptoms and grief. Patients were scored on these dimensions and, on the basis of these, subjected to cluster analysis. Derived classes were compared on a range of demographic and clinical data including psychiatric diagnosis.\nSix classes were found, distinguished by general levels of distress (measured by demoralization, autonomic anxiety and somatoform symptoms), anhedonia and grief. The most distressed groups were Demoralization and Demoralized Grief. Anhedonic Depression showed moderate levels of distress but the highest level of social dysfunction. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) categories of mood disorders did not follow any particular pattern other than reflecting severity of distress. The classes of high distress (Demoralization and Demoralized Grief) were significantly associated with younger age, past history of psychiatric treatment, low Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores over the previous 12 months and DSM-IV somatoform disorders.

Instead of studying one gene at a time, microarrays provide the opportunity to analyze thousands of genes at once.\nThis article reviews the steps in this discovery process, including the acquisition and characterization of high-quality postmortem brain tissue, RNA extraction, and preparation and use of microarray technology. Two alternative microarray methods and factors affecting the quality of array data are reviewed.\nNew analytical strategies are being developed to process the massive data sets generated by microarray studies and to define the significance of implicated genes. Array results must be validated by other methods, including in situ hybridization and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Identified genes can also be evaluated in terms of their chromosomal locations and possible overlap with regions of suggestive linkage or association identified with genome-wide linkage analysis in psychiatry and in terms of overlap with genes identified by microarray studies in animals administered psychoactive drugs. Microarray studies are only the first major step in the process. Further efforts in the investigation involve multiple strategies for studying function and gene structure, including transgenic and knockout animal studies.\nMicroarrays present a methodology that can identify genes or pathways for new and unique potential drug targets, determine premorbid diagnosis, predict drug responsiveness for individual patients, and, eventually, initiate gene therapy and prevention strategies."}, {"Title": "The genes and brains of mice and men.", "Abstract": "The elucidation of the human genome presents a challenge for psychiatry-determining the impact of thousands of genes on brain functions relevant to mental disorders. For both historical and practical reasons, the mouse has become the mammal of choice for applying molecular genetic approaches to gene function. A working draft of the mouse genome has led to estimates that a mouse version may be identified for 99% of human genes. In accord with their genomic homologies, humans and mice share numerous features of brain organization and behavioral responses to many pharmacological agents. Technologies enabling the precise experimental manipulation of the mouse genome provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring genetic contributions to the regulation of complex behavior and to the pathophysiology and treatment of psychiatric disease. The formidable array of mouse molecular genetic tools are applied for two general strategies: 1) exploring the function of particular genes by generating lines of mice with precise genetic alterations and 2) searching broadly for those genes that regulate a particular biological trait of interest. Essential to the effective use of these technologies is the implementation of sound strategies for discerning the impact of genetic manipulations on mouse behaviors relevant to psychiatric conditions. These approaches are having a major impact-examples relevant to psychiatric disorders are discussed. However, advances in implementing and interpreting behavioral assays have not kept pace with molecular genetic technologies. To maximize the extent to which the revolution in mammalian genetics may be effectively applied to psychiatric research, new technologies and strategies for mouse behavioral assessment must be developed."}, {"Title": "The endophenotype concept in psychiatry: etymology and strategic intentions.", "Abstract": "Endophenotypes, measurable components unseen by the unaided eye along the pathway between disease and distal genotype, have emerged as an important concept in the study of complex neuropsychiatric diseases. An endophenotype may be neurophysiological, biochemical, endocrinological, neuroanatomical, cognitive, or neuropsychological (including configured self-report data) in nature. Endophenotypes represent simpler clues to genetic underpinnings than the disease syndrome itself, promoting the view that psychiatric diagnoses can be decomposed or deconstructed, which can result in more straightforward-and successful-genetic analysis. However, to be most useful, endophenotypes for psychiatric disorders must meet certain criteria, including association with a candidate gene or gene region, heritability that is inferred from relative risk for the disorder in relatives, and disease association parameters. In addition to furthering genetic analysis, endophenotypes can clarify classification and diagnosis and foster the development of animal models. The authors discuss the etymology and strategy behind the use of endophenotypes in neuropsychiatric research and, more generally, in research on other diseases with complex genetics."}, {"Title": "Suitable dose and duration of fluvoxamine administration to treat depression.", "Abstract": "The purpose of the present paper was to determine the suitable dose and appropriate trial duration of fluvoxamine to treat for depression. A retrospective cohort analysis was performed among depression patients who were treated in the Department of Psychiatry, Kawasaki Medical School Hospital, Kurashiki, Japan, in 2000. A total of 72 patients received fluvoxamine to treat depression. The dose-response was compared and the initial significant clinical action was examined. The percentage showing improvement after receiving a high daily dose (100-150 mg) of fluvoxamine was 73.7%, but that showing improvement on a low daily dose (50-75 mg) was 47.1%. A significant difference between the two groups was seen on Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test (chi2 = 4.814; d.f. = 1; P = 0.0282). The cumulative percentage of responder patients was more than 80% at the end of a 6-week period. Fluvoxamine is recommended at a daily dose of 100 mg or 150 mg as the initial dose.

Although limited-fidelity virtual reality systems have been used in medical education for decades, modern, high-fidelity virtual reality systems have practical applications in areas ranging from psychiatry to surgical planning and telemedicine. Factors that limit widespread use of virtual reality in medicine include a lack of standards for the re-purposing and sharing of system components and the resultant low return on investment from custom systems. The standards issue is being addressed by economic incentives from organizations such as the U.S. military, which requires computer-based educational materials, including simulations, to be interoperable. Similarly, the low return on investment is becoming less of a factor in clinical scenarios in which virtual reality systems offer physicians and their patients experiences that are impossible or impractical to gain elsewhere."}, {"Title": "Phenomenology of anomalous self-experience in early schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Disorders of self-experience were emphasized in classic literature and in phenomenological psychiatry as essential clinical features of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders, but are neglected in the contemporary psychopathology due to epistemologically motivated distrust of studying anomalies of subjectivity. Based on our own and other empirical studies, we present here detailed clinical phenomenological descriptions of nonpsychotic anomalies of self-experience that may be observable in the prodromal phases of schizophrenia and in the schizotypal disorders. Anomalies of self-experience are grouped according the experiential domain that appears to be affected and are illustrated by short vignettes or verbatim quotes from the patients. It is suggested that disorders of the self deserve further systematic empirical investigations, also from an etiological perspective. Self-disorders may turn out to be potentially useful as a psychopathological organizer of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Psychopathological emphasis on these disorders may also help to integrate the search for the neurodevelopmental mechanisms in schizophrenia with developmental-psychological research on the ontogenesis of the self."}, {"Title": "Concordance for cognitive impairment: a study of 50 community-dwelling elderly female-female twin pairs.", "Abstract": "The present study sought to determine concordance of cognitive impairment among elderly female twins. Cognitive testing was performed by telephone interview in a sample of 100 female-female twins older than 65 years. The participants were 32 monozygotic (MZ) and 18 dizygotic (DZ) female twin pairs, all between the ages of 65 and 86 years; their mean age was 70.2 +/- 4.6 years. All were recruited from the Institute of Psychiatry Volunteer Twin Register (IPVTR). We used the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) and analyzed the modified total score. Correlation's of age and zygosity were computed in relation to score on cognitive interview, and differences between MZ twin pairs (n = 32) and DZ pairs (n = 18) were analyzed using the general linear model procedure. Five subjects of the 64 MZ females (7.8%) and one DZ female (2.4%) were found to be cognitively impaired. In no case was the second twin affected. No differences in cognitive score were found between MZ and DZ twin pairs. In both groups a highly significant correlation was found between age and lower score: R(2) = -0.32, P =.009. We conclude that aging-related impairment in cognitive testing did not differ between MZ and DZ elderly female twins. Although the overall sample size was relatively small and error variance may have been introduced by imprecise measures of zygosity, the present findings are suggestive of gender differences in cognitive performance that need further evaluation."}, {"Title": "Cocaine-like subjective effects of nicotine are not blocked by the D1 selective antagonist ecopipam (SCH 39166).", "Abstract": "The effects of ecopipam (a D(1) selective antagonist) or triazolam pretreatment on the subjective and physiological effects of intravenously administered nicotine were examined in 10 cigarette-smoking cocaine abusers. Under double-blind, randomized conditions, subjects received oral capsule pretreatment (0, 30 or 100 mg ecopipam, or 0.25 mg/70 kg triazolam), followed 120 min later by an intravenous injection of 2 mg/70 kg nicotine or saline. Subjective ratings, heart rate and blood pressure were assessed before and repeatedly after each intravenous injection. Compared to oral placebo pretreatment, both ecopipam and triazolam pretreatment produced significant elevations in subject-reported capsule effect and observer ratings of sleepiness/sedation. Nicotine increased ratings of 'drug effect', 'rush', 'high', 'stimulated', 'liking', 'good effects' and 'bad effects', and produced modest increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Following both intra-venous saline and nicotine injection, ecopipam tended to reduce heart rate and blood pressure. Although both ecopipam and triazolam lowered several subjective ratings following intravenous saline injection, neither ecopipam nor triazolam affected nicotine subjective effects. In contrast to Romach et al. (Arch Gen Psychiatry 56: 1101-1106, 1999), who showed that pretreatment with ecopipam blocked cocaine subjective effects, the current study found no attenuation of the subjective effects of nicotine, and thus, provides no support for the hypothesis that D(1) receptors mediate the cocaine-like subjective effects of nicotine."}, {"Title": "The therapeutic alliance: the key to effective patient outcome? A descriptive review of the evidence in community mental health case management.", "Abstract": "The aim of this review was to examine the level of evidence supporting the assumed link between a positive therapeutic alliance among patients and case managers and effective outcome for patients with a mental illness who are managed in community mental health services.\nMedLine, PsychINFO and Social Sciences Index search of articles from 1986 to 2001 returned 84 articles and two texts. Inclusion criteria were the use of validated measures and relevance to psychiatry and community case management.\nA definite correlation exists in the psychotherapy literature between the therapeutic relationship and improved outcomes, with its potential as a prognostic indicator acknowledged. Attempts to apply the concept to patients outside the field of psychotherapy have been slow, although expansion of the concept to other forms of change-inducing therapy was a current trend. Issues of definition, quantification and measurement of the relationship caused rigorous debate in the literature. Case management research demonstrating the importance of the therapeutic relationship and 'goodness-of-fit' between patients and case managers was sparse with no published Australian studies.\nThe level of evidence supporting the link between the therapeutic alliance of patients with mental illness and improved outcomes although sparse is encouraging. It indicates the potential of the alliance as a predictor of outcome for patients engaged in case management services in community mental health. Research to determine the role and effectiveness of the alliance in the patient/case manager dyad is needed to define this potential. Effectiveness of clinical practice in the case management field could be enhanced if research findings confirmed the genesis and value of the alliance in case management.

They are as disabling as psychotic disorders, and comorbid depression in particular is a predictor of increased morbidity and mortality. Acknowledging this, the Second Australian National Mental Health Plan called for consultation-liaison psychiatry to be allowed to participate fully in the mental health care system. It stated that failure to define the term 'severe mental health problems and mental disorders' in the First Plan had led to some public mental health systems erroneously equating severity with diagnosis rather than level of need and disability. The call has been largely unheeded. The implication for patient care is both direct and indirect; the context created for psychiatry training by such a restricted focus is helping to perpetuate the neglect of such patients. This is a worldwide problem.\nProactive involvement with consumers is required if the problem is to be redressed. At a service level, development of a seamless web of pre-admission/admission/post-discharge functions is required if patients with physical/psychiatric comorbidity and somatoform disorders are to receive effective care, and consultation-liaison psychiatry services are to be able to demonstrate efficacy.

Yet, several fundamental aspects of primary food reinforcement, motivation, and appetite are left intact after interference with accumbens DA transmission. Recent studies have shown that accumbens DA is involved in responsiveness to conditioned stimuli and activational aspects of motivation. In concurrent choice tasks, accumbens DA depletions cause animals to reallocate their choice behavior in the direction of instrumental behaviors that involve less effort. Also, an emerging body of evidence has demonstrated that the effects of accumbens DA depletions on instrumental food-seeking behavior can vary greatly depending upon the task. For example, some schedules of reinforcement are insensitive to the effects of DA depletions, whereas others are highly sensitive (e.g., large fixed ratios). Accumbens DA depletions slow the rate of operant responding, blunt the rate-facilitating effects of moderate-sized ratios, and enhance the rate-suppressing effects of very large ratios (i.e., produce ratio strain). Accumbens DA may be important for enabling rats to overcome behavioral constraints, such as work-related response costs, and may be critical for the behavioral organization and conditioning processes that enable animals to engage in vigorous responses, such as barrier climbing, or to emit large numbers of responses in ratio schedules in the absence of primary reinforcement. The involvement of accumbens DA in activational aspects of motivation has implications for energy-related disorders in psychiatry, as well as aspects of drug-seeking behavior."}, {"Title": "[Dr. Elisabeth Hecker (1895-1986): career in child and adolescent psychiatry on the one hand--involvement in elimination of the handicapped on the other hand].", "Abstract": "During the period of national socialism in Loben/Lublinitz (Silesia) existed a children's special department, where many disabled and mentally retarded children were killed.

Part II -- disorders of intrinsically abnormal animal spirits.", "Abstract": "Thomas Willis (1621-1675), author of the classical work Cerebri Anatome (1664), was arguably the father of the modern era of neurology. His clinical neurology, as described in his Pathologiae Cerebri (1667) and De Anima Brutorum (1672), was largely derived from personal observations and not from traditional authorities and was based around his concept of the animal spirits, a fictitious entity in many ways analogous to the present day idea of the nerve impulse. This concept allowed him to develop a pathology of the animal spirits which embraced the whole content of the clinical neurology and psychiatry of his times. The anatomical and physiological background to Willis' concepts of animal spirit dysfunction, and those disorders he regarded as due to disturbed function of intrinsically normal animal spirits, have been dealt with in the previous part of this paper. The disorders he attributed to intrinsically abnormal animal spirits, dealt with in this part of the paper, comprised two categories. In one, the animal spirits possessed explosive properties, whilst in the other the abnormalities were non-explosive in their nature. The former category included epilepsy, hysteria and hypochondriasis, whilst the latter included mainly disorders now considered psychiatric e.g. delirium, melancholy, madness and stupidity. Willis' ideas about the pathogenesis of nervous system disorder seem never to have been generally accepted, partly because they appeared at a time when others were increasingly calling into question the existence of the animal spirits. Nevertheless, Willis' attempt to record and interpret all nervous system disease on the basis of disorder of function of a single underlying mechanism represents a formidable synthetic intellectual endeavour on the part of a very busy physician."}, {"Title": "Prevalence and correlates of areca nut use among psychiatric patients in India.", "Abstract": "To estimate the prevalence and identify the correlates of areca nut use among men and women being treated for a major psychiatric disorder in India.\nInpatients (N=988) admitted to the adult psychiatry department of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences in India were interviewed regarding their use of the areca nut, tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs.

However, little is known about the clinical characteristics and illness severity of anxiety disorders in this setting. We studied the clinical characteristics of low-income compared with middle-income primary care panic patients.

Public sector patients were more often older, male, single, unemployed, of lower income, and non-Caucasian ethnicity. They had more severe clinical symptoms, more medical comorbidity, worse physical and role health status, and more emergency room visits. Low income and unemployment accounted for most of the differences in non-anxiety-related measures.

As the interview does not entail any great expenditures, it can be used in routine quality assurance."}, {"Title": "[Value of telephone interview for quality assurance and therapy evaluation in child and adolescent psychiatry. Review of the literature and empirical results of participation quota and possible sampling bias].", "Abstract": "The incurred costs of telephone interviews are lower than those of other methods. Thus the question arises whether this method affords the necessary quality for therapy evaluation in child and adolescent psychiatry and psychopathology. A review of the literature shows higher rates of participation for telephone and personal interviews as opposed to those for questionnaires sent by mail. Results of investigations within the social sciences are inconsistent with regard to the quality of the data collected in telephone interviews. The few results available from samples from psychiatry permit no clear-cut conclusions as to the quality of such data.\nThe results of two follow-up studies of former inpatients of a hospital for child and adolescent psychiatry are presented with regard to the rate of participation and the sample bias.\nThe empirical data show a higher rate of participation for telephone interviews (85%) than for either personal interviews or questionnaires sent by mail. Sample bias in telephone interviews is smaller than in the other assessment approaches.\nSince the advantages of telephone interviews outweigh those of other methods, this method of interviewing should be used as a matter of routine for quality assurance and therapy evaluation."}, {"Title": "The relationship of neuropsychological abilities to specific domains of functional capacity in older schizophrenia patients.", "Abstract": "This study sought to determine the relative importance of cognitive measures in predicting various domains of everyday functional capacity in older outpatients with schizophrenia.\nNinety-three psychiatry outpatients with diagnoses of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders underwent a comprehensive neuropsychiatric evaluation, including neuropsychological testing and clinical ratings of psychopathology. Functional capacity was assessed with the Direct Assessment of Functional Status, a performance measure of basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs/IADLs).\nNeuropsychological performance significantly predicted most ADLs/IADLs measured, except simple eating behaviors, time orientation, and grooming. Lower educational level and negative symptoms also were associated with worse functional capacity, whereas positive symptoms and depressed mood were not. Measures of cognitive functioning accounted for more variance in functional capacity than did psychiatric ratings of symptoms, and multiple regression analyses demonstrated that neuropsychological performance was predictive of functional capacity, over and above clinical symptoms. No specific cognitive domains were differentially predictive of specific domains of functional capacity.\nNeurocognitive abilities were more predictive of functional capacity than level of clinical symptoms; however, these abilities were not specific predictors of functioning. This is consistent with findings of relatively generalized, intercorrelated cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and multiply determined domains of everyday functioning."}, {"Title": "Neuroendocrine aspects of hypercortisolism in major depression.", "Abstract": "A consistent finding in biological psychiatry is that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis physiology is altered in humans with major depression. These findings include hypersecretion of cortisol at baseline and on the dexamethasone suppression test. In this review, we present a process-oriented model for HPA axis regulation in major depression. Specifically, we suggest that acute depressions are characterized by hypersecretion of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor, pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and adrenal cortisol. In chronic depressions, however, enhanced adrenal responsiveness to ACTH and glucocorticoid negative feedback work in complementary fashion so that cortisol levels remain elevated while ACTH levels are reduced. In considering the evidence for hypercortisolism in humans, studies of nonhuman primates are presented and their utility and limitations as comparative models of human depression are discussed."}, {"Title": "Achieving board certification in psychiatry: a cohort study.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to track the progress of a cohort of graduates of psychiatry residency training programs in achieving certification by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN).

The cohort's performance on the part I and part II examinations was analyzed, as was the relationship between performance on the two examinations.\nApproximately 8 years after their first attempt at the part I examination, 85% of the cohort were certified, and 15% were not. The majority passed both the part I and part II examinations on the first attempt. Those who passed part I on the first attempt were more likely than those who failed to pass part II on the first attempt. Of the 627 who were certified at follow-up, 199 (32%) were also certified in one subspecialty, and 29 (5%) were certified in two, for a total of 257 subspecialty certificates.\nThe results of this study suggest that most recent graduates of residency training programs who attempt the ABPN process are likely to become board certified, and the majority will do so by passing both components on the first attempt."}, {"Title": "The discovery of Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "On November 3, 1906, a clinical psychiatrist and neuroanatomist, Alois Alzheimer, reported \"A peculiar severe disease process of the cerebral cortex\" to the 37th Meeting of South-West German Psychiatrists in Tubingen, He described a 50-year-old woman whom he had followed from her admission for paranoia, progressive sleep and memory disturbance, aggression, and confusion, until her death 5 years later.

Results of the DIALOGUE study].", "Abstract": "The field of comorbidity between organic pathologies and mood disorders remains insufficiently explored, whereas such comorbidities predict a more unfavorable outcome of both mood disorders and organic pathologies themselves.\nThe purpose of the Depression and organic diseases study (DIALOGUE) was to obtain in France a set of quantitative data on the prevalence of comorbidities between major depressive episodes (MDE) and associated chronic organic pathologies (ACOP), as well as on the diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties encountered in the management of such comorbidities in daily medical practice.\nGeneral practitioners (GP) and private or hospital psychiatrists were invited to collect several socio-demographic, clinical and therapeutic data on five consecutive patients corresponding to the inclusion criteria. Four groups of patients were set up: 2 082 patients followed up in primary care by their GP for a chronic somatic pathology (GPS group), as well as 2 017, 1 335 and 522 patients respectively followed up in primary care (PPD group), private (GPD group) or hospital psychiatry (HPD group) for a depression not already treated, or requiring modification of its pharmacological treatment (GPD, PPD and HPD group).\nAmong the patients of the GPS group, 41% presented with an associated MDE and, among the depressed patients of the three other groups, respectively 47, 55 and 63% presented with an ACOP. MDE were rather old (more than six months of duration) and severe. However, only 20% of the MDE in the GPS group had a treatment in progress, while in 74% of these same cases the onset of MDE was retrospectively dated more than 2 months before the day of the inclusion in the study. The ACOP, whose functional impact was judged as more severe (cancer, HIV, neurological diseases, renal insufficiency, osteo-articular diseases, insulino-dependent diabetes and coronary heart disease) were more often considered as responsible for the concomitant MDE and more often followed up in psychiatric settings than the other pathologies. Among the overlap signs between the ACOP and the MDE, fatigue was cited first and embarrassed psychiatrists more than GPs, contrary to sleep disorders. In spite of the diagnostic difficulties related to the comorbidity and recognized by all the physicians, GPs seldom asked for the opinion of a psychiatrist (5%) and appealed less often than psychiatrists to the cognitive and affective signs specific of the depression (low self-esteem, anhedonia).\nThe unrecognized frequency in the association between depression and organic pathologies pleads for closer cooperation between GPs and psychiatrists, as for continuous training not only of the GPs, but also the psychiatrists, in order to limit the observational biases and the therapeutic hesitations induced by these comorbidities."}, {"Title": "Our neglect of the normal variation is linked to a reluctance to accept multifactorial inheritance and the role of environment.", "Abstract": "One of the most surprising evolutionary discoveries is that wild species similar to human contain a vast reservoir of variability. Why are we persistently reluctant to discuss normal variation in brain structure and function and label any deviation pathological? Despite the failure of Mendelian Genetics to solve the genetic puzzle in psychiatry, we refuse to discuss multifactorial inheritance and the role of environmental factors. Rising living conditions (high protein diet) accelerate maturation, lower pubertal age, shift body-built toward more weight for height and cerebral excitability toward higher levels. Another environmental factor which has to be provided by diet is marine fat which our brain consists of. It normalizes brain function at all levels of excitability and possibly prevents psychotic episodes if adequately supplied. As part of Human Variation in Growth and Maturation, Schizophrenia and Manic-depressive psychosis are multifactorially inherited and share susceptibility loci. They are localized at the extremes of variation. Excitability, body-built, clinical picture and CNS finding accord with this, their phenotypic characteristics might prove valuable in a hunt for genes not common to both disorders."}, {"Title": "A comparison study of early non-psychotic deviant behavior in Afrikaner and US patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.", "Abstract": "In a previous study early non-psychotic deviant behaviors in US adult schizophrenic patients recruited for a large-scale genetic study were examined (Psychiatry Research, 101, 101). Early deviance characterized a distinct subgroup of patients at rates that were consistent with earlier reports. In addition, specific early non-psychotic deviant behaviors were meaningfully associated with later disease outcomes. In the present study, we examined the demographic, syndrome course, symptom and early deviant behavior history of 109 Afrikaner probands who met criteria for DSM schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and compared them to 109 age- and gender-matched US probands. Consistent with past findings, 68% of Afrikaner probands, as compared to 67% of age- and gender-matched US probands, reported one or more forms of early non-psychotic deviance, including poor socialization, extreme fears/chronic sadness, and/or attention/learning impairment. The remaining 32 and 33% of probands, respectively, were without behavioral deviance until the onset of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The frequency and distribution of individual deviant behaviors were strikingly consistent between the samples. However, logistic regression analyses revealed different patterns of associations between the early deviant behaviors manifested and disease outcome. Afrikaner participants with early fears/chronic sadness were 3 times more likely to attempt suicide, while among US participants, this form of early deviance conferred 3.5 times more risk for later schizoaffective disorder, and 3 times greater likelihood of later sensory (tactile and/or olfactory) hallucinations. Afrikaner participants with attention/learning impairment were 2.5 times more likely to experience later auditory hallucinations, while US participants with these early difficulties were 3 times more likely to experience thought disorder. We concluded that early non-psychotic childhood deviance in this independently collected Afrikaner population distinguished a distinct subtype of patients and that the forms of early deviance manifested were meaningfully linked to later disease outcome. Possible reasons for the association pattern differences in these two populations are considered."}, {"Title": "Assessing the implementation and effects of a trauma-focused intervention for youths in residential treatment.", "Abstract": "This paper describes methods being used to implement and assess the effects of a trauma-focused intervention in residential treatment programs for youths with emotional and behavioral problems, and histories of maltreatment and exposure to family or community violence.

While several strategies have been attempted, including medication switch, antidepressant polypharmacy and various augmentative regimens, success remains limited. Amantadine (AMN), an agent traditionally used in the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza, is now known to exhibit prominent effects at the level of dopaminergic, monoamine oxidase and N-methyl-D-aspartate systems. The present reports on the efficacy of AMN as augmentation to standard antidepressant treatment in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Eight patients with treatment-resistant depression consented to receive AMN, titrated up to a dose of 300 mg, over a period of 4 weeks in a non-blinded fashion. Improvement in both depression and anxiety scores were observed from week 1, with patients exhibiting improvement of depressive scores of up to 49% by study completion. Females appeared to exhibit a stronger response, and within a shorter period of time. Side-effects reported included dry mouth and sedation. AMN appears to demonstrate efficacy as a safe and effective augmentative agent in treatment-resistant depression. Further studies are clearly mandated to test these preliminary observations in a double-blinded manner."}, {"Title": "[The spectrum of bipolar disorders].", "Abstract": "On the basis of epidemiology, neurobiology and clinical observation, the classification of bipolar disorders has shown considerable development and expansion in recent years. In particular, the recognition of mixed states, the introduction of bipolar II disorders, increasing awareness of the diagnosis of hypomania, as well as the interest in cyclothymic disorders and temperament have led to a shift in diagnostic attitudes in the USA, as well as in European countries. In this article, the possible clinical and scientific benefits of such tendencies are discussed, as are the risks of broadening bipolar disorders beyond DSM-IV. Also demonstrated is how several \"modern\" concepts of bipolarity have deep roots in the history of German psychiatry; a mixity scale based on Kraepelin's classification of affective mixed states is presented."}, {"Title": "[Meaning of \"becoming\" in the Japanese psychopathologic view as compared with the German-speaking view].", "Abstract": "Until now, Japanese cultural concepts such as \"ki\" and \"aida\" were used to introduce new perspectives to psychopathology. Universal concepts can also serve this purpose when the culturally different connotations are worked out. In this study,we discuss the concept \"becoming,\" which is not only universal but also undoubtedly one of the key words in psychiatry. As is well known,Zutt made a contribution to psychopathology with a clear differentiation between \"becoming\" and \"doing.\" It is interesting that some Japanese linguists also mentioned the same difference, namely that between the Japanese logic of \"becoming\" and the Western logic of \"doing.\" Accordingly, tai-jin-ky\u00f4fu as anxiety about \"becoming\" is contrasted with sociophobia as anxiety about \"doing.\" However, \"becoming\" in the sense of Zutt is different from the Japanese in three aspects,namely the physical, social and temporal ones. These differences refer to the various meanings of \"nature.\" Finally,we mention the possibility of applying the Japanese term \"becoming\" to psychopathology."}, {"Title": "[Hermeneutic psychopathology of psychoses: scientific basis, concepts, and clinical aspects].", "Abstract": "Besides biological psychiatry and its neurobiological field, the psychotic patient's subjectivity and his changed relations to himself and others can be isolated as a field of hermeneutic-psychopathological research.

The broadest interpretation of the concept of psychosis prior to the turn of the nineteenth to the twentieth centuries has today been reduced to the modern differentiations of psychopathologies and neuroses. Since then, no consensus has been reached on the extent of the concept of psychosis.We have remained at the \"persistent unclarity\" described by H. Kindt. Contemporary diagnostic systems have done without the concept of psychosis. The indication \"psychotic\" which has taken its place and is based primarily on characteristically schizophrenic phenomena is also unclear.

With respect to this issue, positron emission tomography (PET) findings indicate that cognitive and behavioral modifications, occurring in a psychotherapeutic context, can lead to regional brain metabolic changes in patients with major depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder. The goal of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, which constitutes the first neuroimaging investigation of the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) using an emotional activation paradigm, was to probe the effects of CBT on the neural correlates of spider phobia. In order to do so, fMRI was used in subjects suffering from spider phobia (n = 12) to measure, before and after effective CBT, regional brain activity during the viewing of film excerpts depicting spiders. Normal control subjects were also scanned (once) while they were exposed to the same film excerpts. Results showed that, in phobic subjects before CBT, the transient state of fear triggered, during the viewing of the phobogenic stimuli, was correlated with significant activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area-BA 10), the parahippocampal gyrus, and the visual associative cortical areas, bilaterally. For normal control subjects (n = 13), only the left middle occipital gyrus and the right inferior temporal gyrus were significantly activated. In phobic subjects before CBT, the activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 10) may reflect the use of metacognitive strategies aimed at self-regulating the fear triggered by the spider film excerpts, whereas the parahippocampal activation might be related to an automatic reactivation of the contextual fear memory that led to the development of avoidance behavior and the maintenance of spider phobia. After successful completion of CBT, no significant activation was found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 10) or the parahippocampal gyrus. These findings suggest that a psychotherapeutic approach, such as CBT, has the potential to modify the dysfunctional neural circuitry associated with anxiety disorders. They further indicate that the changes made at the mind level, within a psychotherapeutic context, are able to functionally \"rewire\" the brain."}, {"Title": "Generalized covariance-adjusted canonical correlation analysis with application to psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The lack of control over covariates in practice motivates the need for their adjustment when measuring the degree of association between two sets of variables, for which canonical correlation is traditionally used. In most studies however, there is also a lack of control over the attributes of responses for the sets of variables of interest. In particular, a portion of the response variable may be continuous and the other discrete. For such settings, the traditional partial canonical correlation approach is restrictive, since a covariate-adjustment for a set of continuous variables is assumed. By ignoring the assumption of continuous variates and proceeding with a partial canonical correlation analysis in the presence of continuous and discrete variates, results in canonical correlation estimates that are not consistent. In this paper we generalize the traditional partial canonical correlation approach to covariate-adjustment by allowing the response variables to contain continuous, as well as discrete, variates. The methodology is illustrated with a psychiatric application for examining which sleep variables relate to which depressive symptoms, as measured by commonly used constructs that presents with both continuous and discrete outcomes."}, {"Title": "Efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of affective disorders.", "Abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a relatively noninvasive technique to interfere with the function of small cortical areas through currents induced by alternating magnetic fields emanating from a handheld coil placed directly above the targeted area. This technique has clear effects on a whole range of measures of brain function and has become an important research tool in neuropsychiatry. More recently, TMS has been studied in psychiatry mainly to assess its putative therapeutic effects in treatment refractory major depression.

Whereas traditional psychiatry has considered erotomania to be almost entirely restricted to women, recent studies have revealed that criminal offenses associated with the condition occur much more frequently in men. The main hypothesis of this article is that these findings may be explained in terms of evolutionary theory. Erotomania, accordingly, may be viewed as a pathological variant of a specific sexual strategy that evolved under selection pressures of the human environment of evolutionary adaptedness. The overt behavior is related to the pursuit of long-term mating, its potentially beneficial effect on inclusive fitness of the individual, and disparate strategies of the sexes to ensure sexual fidelity of the potential partner. Therefore, the evolutionary approach provides a plausible explanation as to why forensically relevant erotomania prevails in men. The pathological process of delusional misinterpretation of perceived signals from the social environment itself may result from poor reality testing due to a failure of social meta-cognition. The evolutionary perspective may provide additional insights into the nature of sex-specific behaviors and may improve our understanding of forensically relevant behaviors."}, {"Title": "Violence against nurses in hospitals: prevalence and effects.", "Abstract": "There is abundant evidence to suggest that violence in healthcare settings, especially in emergency departments (EDs) and psychiatry, is escalating and that nurses are particularly vulnerable.

Seventy out of 81 nurses experienced verbal insults or threats of imminent violence and 13 were also physically attacked during the 1-year period. Sixty-seven out of 70 nurses suffered from one or more after-effects, including flashbacks, sleeplessness, fearfulness, depression or taking time off work.

Overall agreement between DSM-III-R and GMS-A/HAS-AGECAT was moderate. Adapting thresholds for AGECAT resulted in slightly better diagnostic efficiency. Diagnostic disagreement was found predominantly for cases with intermediate symptom severity, supporting the hypothesis of differing thresholds between DSM-III-R and GMS-A/HAS-AGECAT, while cases with lower or higher symptom severity were similarly seen as cases or non-cases.\nDisagreement is not only caused by conceptual differences, but also different thresholds of diagnostic algorithms. Adaptation of threshold levels should be feasible, depending on the purpose of the analysis."}, {"Title": "Re-reading the IPSS research record.", "Abstract": "The International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia has had a major influence on mental health and research practice since its inception in the 1960s.

In this review, we attempt to illustrate perspectives on eating disorders that have emerged since then from the work at the Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin. It is shown that the professional fate of care for eating disorders has been tied closely to the maturation of the specialty of child and adolescent psychiatry and psychotherapy in the 20(th) century. From the early beginnings of Theodor Ziehen (1862-1950) heading the Psychiatric and Neurological University Clinic of the Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin and being devoted to child psychiatry and psychology, the issue of eating disorders has been pursued at the Charit\u00e9 throughout the vicissitudes of time. After a ward for children suffering from mental illnesses was instituted by Karl Bonhoeffer (1868-1948) in 1921, child and adolescent psychiatry and psychotherapy has constituted itself first in terms of a division and finally as a separate department at the Charit\u00e9 Hospital. Over the years, quite a remarkable body of work on eating disorders has accumulated in this institution. It is emphasised that the value of contributions inherited appears not just of historical interest. The past has addressed psychotherapeutic, anthropological, biological, psychometric, neuropsychological, and transcultural aspects which continue to yield insights into the nature of eating disorders. Tasks and prospects ahead are based upon this background, and some of these are outlined briefly."}, {"Title": "Volume estimation of prefrontal cortical subfields using MRI and stereology.", "Abstract": "The objective of this protocol was to provide a rapid, neurofunctionally relevant alternative to region-drawing or automated gyral/sulcal-based techniques.

The aim of this study is to examine sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of CD.\nAmong 198 consecutive patients having CD diagnosed by structured DSM-III-R clinical interview, the psychosocial characteristics of the patients were clinically investigated.\nThe most common subtype of CD was non-epileptic seizure (NES) (41.4 %). The psychosocial stress factors were found in the initiation or at the last episode of the disorder (88.9 %). The most prominent problem related with primary support group was traumatic event (37.9 %) followed by problems associated with migration and related economical problems which are the most important problems of the study area. The incidence of depressive disorders was high in patients with CD, and the histrionic personality disorder was the most prominent personality pathology among the patients. Direct referral to psychiatry clinics appeared to be low (12.1 %).\nOur findings have shown that traumatic events may have an important role in the occurrence, severity and duration of CD, and most of the patients seek help from religious healers. The study has also revealed that lower education level and socioeconomic and sociocultural problems may play a role in the occurrence of the disorder as well as regarding its course."}, {"Title": "Hospital doctors' management of psychological problems - Mayou & Smith revisited.", "Abstract": "In 1986 the British Journal of Psychiatry published a study of physicians' and surgeons' management of psychological problems, later cited as evidence of barriers limiting liaison psychiatry.\nTo repeat the study after 16 years of liaison psychiatry.\nAnonymous, confidential questionnaires were distributed to doctors at St George's Hospital, London, replicating the original study.\nMost of the 225 respondents believed that psychological factors could influence physical prognosis and should be routinely assessed, with greater sense of responsibility for overdoses and dying patients.

They analyzed antidepressant intake relative to drug classification and mechanism of action, age, sex and associated potential for clinical complications such as xerostomia, orthostatic hypotension and interaction with vasoconstrictors. The potential for additive adverse effects between antidepressants and other medications also was analyzed.\nThree hundred eighty-one (21 percent) of the 1,800 patient records indicated that patients were being treated with 412 antidepressants. Female subjects out-numbered male subjects by an approximate 2.3:1 ratio. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were most commonly prescribed, followed by tricyclic antidepressants, atypical and third-generation antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Based on reported medication intake, almost 58 percent of subjects in the antidepressant group were receiving treatment with two or more medications that had the potential for producing xerostomia. Two hundred fifty-seven (67 percent) of the 381 records documented intake of an antidepressant or other medication with orthostatic hypotension potential.\nThree hundred eighty-one patients reported that they were receiving antidepressant therapy for psychiatric and other medical reasons.

In the first half of the nineteenth century, physiologists investigated reflex actions and applied a recently coined word, \"automatism,\" to describe actions which, although seeming to arise from higher centers, actually result from automatic reaction to sensory stimuli. Experiments with spinal reflexes led to the investigation of the reflex action of the brain or \"cerebral automatisms.\" Reflex actions of this kind were used to explain everything from acting compulsively to composing symphonies. Physiological explanations of phenomena of this kind seemed insufficient to some and, in the 1880s, Frederic Myers and Pierre Janet developed psychological frameworks for understanding these phenomena, positing hidden centers of intelligence at work in the individual, outside ordinary awareness, which produce what came to be called \"psychological automatisms.\" Their attempts to unify this psychological framework with the existing physiological one failed.

Next, these Western personality models were used to explore the underlying structure of axis II syndromes of personality disorder as observed in Yugoslav patients. Finally, the models were tested regarding their ability to diagnose and discriminate categorical diagnoses of axis I mental disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, and psychoses). The Five Factor Model of personality and the Seven Factor Model of temperament and character were applied to normal subjects and clinical patients with categorical axis I and axis II diagnoses (depression, anxiety, psychosis, and personality disorder), at the Institute for Psychiatry, University of Belgrade, Yugoslavia.

This failure of the clinical imagination reflects both reluctance to confront the enormity of patients' loss and cultural differences in self-presentation, self-understanding, memory and identity. This potential for incredulity is redoubled in the formal hearing before the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) where the claim for refugee status is adjudicated. Contemporary psychiatric practice is rooted in taking patients' stories at face value as accounts of their experience or reading through them to identify signs and symptoms of psychopathology. From this perspective any account reveals both the narrator's shifting experiential world and the current functioning of their cognitive machinery. Truth is 'experiential truth' and is relative to the narrator's social position, mental health and emotional state. In contrast, the IRB assesses the narrative of asylum seekers against the notion of a truthful story as fixed and isomorphic to a single historical sequence of events. From the perspective of the IRB members, any deviation from this fixed account is evidence of dissimulation designed to claim the valued status of refugee. The conflicting epistemologies of clinical psychiatry and the refugee hearing throw into relief the functions of social imagination in the construction, interpretation and assessment of the truth-value of narratives of identity and affliction."}, {"Title": "Five years experience of prescribing milnacipran: An interview with Didier Papeta (Head of Psychiatry, General Military Hospital, Brest, France).", "Abstract": "The serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), milnacipran, has been available in France for over 5 years.

Also to establish what demographic factors, if any, modulated those opinions. METHOD A 17-item, five-point, questionnaire was supplied to all medical and nursing staff working on five wards of a psychiatric inpatient unit. Demographic details of the respondents were also recorded. RESULTS Some items produced almost unanimous responses: 92.5% agreeing or strongly agreeing that some inpatients form sexually active relationships that are detrimental to their health. Staff felt that single sex wards should be available but were unsure that they would improve quality of life for either patients or staff. The strongest factor predicting response was profession (doctor or nurse), the responses being significantly different in eight of the 17 items. Doctors were more likely to believe that women's and staff's lives would be better on single sex wards and were less likely to be satisfied with current arrangements. They were also more likely to believe that sex was common among inpatients, and that there was an unofficial place to go in hospitals to have sex. Doctors worried more about the patient choice of sexual partner and believed that health workers should have a role in influencing that choice. Doctors also felt more strongly that patients sometimes form sexually active relationships of benefit to health. Ward was the next most important, being significantly different in four of the 17 questions. Gender and age of respondents produced few differences. CONCLUSIONS In view of the United Kingdom government commitment to phasing out mixed sex hospital accommodation by 2002 (Safety, privacy and dignity in mental health units - Guidance on mixed sex accommodation, Department of Health, 2000), the doubts of staff about improvement to inpatient quality of life, and their own quality of working life need to be further examined. Staff attitudes generally are more likely to be determined by job or ward of employment than the staff's gender, age, or experience of psychiatry. This may have implications in tailoring training schemes for staff of inpatient psychiatric units."}, {"Title": "Quality of Life in 833 outpatients with major depression treated with open-label venlafaxine extended release: An observational 24-week study.", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Quality of Life (QoL) assessments are common in medicine and, recently, in psychiatry, mostly in patients with chronic mental illness. We evaluated QoL in depressed outpatients treated with venlafaxine-XR over a period of 24 weeks. METHOD We evaluated 833 patients with DSM-IV major depression using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (M\u00c5DRS), and the QoL in Depression Scale (QLDS). The patients received venlafaxine-XR and we evaluated them after 4, 8, and 24 weeks of treatment. RESULTS HAM-D scores decreased from a baseline of 24.6 &#45 6.3 to 6.0 &#45 5.5 (mean &#45 SD; P <0.0001) after 24 weeks. HAM-A scores decreased from a baseline of 32.3 &#45 7.9 to 6.8 &#45 6.8 ( P <0.0001) after 24 weeks. QLDS scores decreased from a baseline of 25.8 &#45 5.8 to 6.6 &#45 7.5 ( P <0.0001) after 24 weeks, indicating improvement in QoL. The response after 4 weeks was also significant and continued improving during the study. Venlafaxine-XR was shown to be safe and well tolerated. DISCUSSION Open-label venlafaxine-XR was safe, effective, well tolerated, and improved not only depression and anxiety symptoms, but also QoL, in outpatients with major depression. This study has the limitations of any non-randomized, non-blinded multiple-site clinical trial."}, {"Title": "Survey of inpatients child and adolescent psychiatric referrals in a teaching hospital in Saudi Arabia.", "Abstract": "To answer the question of which specialties utilize the service of child and adolescent liaison psychiatry and what are the problems that are likely to bring a child or an adolescent to the attention of psychiatry.\nThe case records of all inpatient children and adolescents younger than 18 years, who were referred to the psychiatric team at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia over a period of 6 years between July 1992 and July 1998, were retrospectively reviewed in regard to sociodemographic data, referring specialties and reason for referral.\nSeven percent of referred patients were younger than 18 years. Most were Saudi nationals. Females outnumbered males. Most of the referrals were by the neurologists, endocrinologists and gastroenterologists. The most common reasons for referral were behavioral disturbances and absence of physical findings that could explain the complaint.\nLow utilization of child and adolescent liaison psychiatry, reflecting the ability of pediatricians and physicians to recognize psychiatrically disturbed children and adolescents compared to adults, may explain the small number of referrals."}, {"Title": "The dual factor structure of self-rated MDQ hypomania: energized-activity versus irritable-thought racing.", "Abstract": "Bipolar II is diagnosed in a clinically depressed patient by documenting history of hypomania. Therefore, it is of great significance for both clinical and research purposes to characterize the factor structure of hypomania.\nAmong consecutive depressive outpatients-126 major depressives and 187 bipolar II-diagnosed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (Clinician Version), 181 who had clinically recovered from depression were administered the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ of. Am. J. Psychiatry 157, 1873). The MDQ is a newly developed, psychometrically validated self-report screening instrument for bipolar spectrum disorders. It screens for lifetime history of manic/hypomanic symptoms by including yes/no items covering all DSM-IV symptoms of mania/hypomania. The MDQ symptom interrelationships were studied by principal component analysis with varimax rotation.\nHypomanic symptoms occurring in >50% were racing thoughts, increased energy and social activity, and irritability. Factor analysis revealed two factors: 'Energized-Activity' (eigenvalue=3.1) and 'Irritability-Racing Thoughts' (eigenvalue=1.5).\nCross-sectional assessment.\nSelf-assessment of past hypomanic symptoms by patients, during clinical remission from depression, revealed two independent hypomanic factors, neither of which comprised euphoria. Hypomanic behavior appears to be more fundamental for the diagnosis of hypomania than elated mood accorded priority in DSM-IV; of hypomanic moods, irritability had greater significance than elation. It would appear that self-report of euphoria is less likely when hypomanias are brief (>or=2 vs. >or=4 days). The main implication for busy clinical practice is that energized activity and irritable mood associated with racing thoughts represent the modal experiences of hypomania among bipolar II outpatients; euphoria is neither sensitive, nor pathognomonic, in the diagnosis of these patients. These conclusions accord with recommendations made many years ago for the diagnosis of hypomania among cyclothymic patients [. Am. J. Psychiatry 134, 1227]."}, {"Title": "Rates and predictors of aftercare services among formerly hospitalized adolescents: a prospective naturalistic study.", "Abstract": "To examine rates and predictors of aftercare use, lengths of service use, and predictors of the duration of aftercare service use among 180 adolescents monitored for up to 8.1 years after discharge from an inpatient psychiatry unit.\nDrawing upon the Anderson-Newman model of service use, severity of illness, enabling, and predisposing factors assessed during the hospitalization were examined as potential predictors of service use. Information about outpatient mental health specialty services after hospitalization was assessed repeatedly and verified with treatment records.\nSeventy-three percent of adolescents received aftercare within the first month after discharge, and 92% eventually received outpatient services. Fifty-seven percent of adolescents remained in treatment 6 months after initiation of services. Psychiatric comorbidity, prior service use, and presence of a biological parent or grandparent in the home were related to initial service use. Psychiatric comorbidity and history of repeated suicide attempts were related to longer duration, and older age and minority group status were related to shorter duration of aftercare service use.\nMost adolescents receive aftercare services, but there are certain groups that are relatively less likely to access or remain in services. Interventions to decrease the barriers to care in such groups may be beneficial."}, {"Title": "A comparative study of stress and burnout among staff caregivers in nursing homes and acute geriatric wards.", "Abstract": "To compare levels of stress and burnout among staff caregivers in nursing homes and acute geriatric wards of general hospitals.\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted in three nursing homes (total of 522 beds, 270 caregivers) and nine geriatric sections of general hospitals (total of 371 beds, 280 caregivers). Staff caregivers were asked to answer a four-part questionnaire made up of socio-demographic data, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Stressful Events Questionnaire (SEQ).\n355 carers (172 from nursing homes, 183 from acute geriatric wards) answered the questionnaire (response rate 66%). Bivariate analysis reveals that general hospital carers show higher GHQ scores, higher MBI-Depersonalisation (DP) and Emotional Exhaustion (EE) sub-scores and lower MBI-Personal Accomplishment sub-scores. Stressful Events (as revealed by the SEQ) are more frequently reported by general hospital carers, particularly events related to patients' behavioural disorders. Multivariate analysis shows that general hospital work-setting, professional role, female gender and patient/carer ratio are significant explanatory variables of a high MBI-EE sub-score, while general work setting and disability are the best explanatory variables of a high MBI-DP sub-score. Professional role and general hospital work-setting are independent factors in a low MBI-Personal Accomplishment (PA) sub-score.\nThese results appear to show that levels of stress and burnout among staff caregivers are moderate in acute geriatric wards, but significantly higher than in nursing homes. This suggests that increasing the rate of trained staff and improving staff support-for instance by the implementation of Consultation-Liaison (C-L) Psychiatry and/or continuing education programmes-could be needed mostly in acute geriatric wards."}, {"Title": "Up-regulation of neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic and bipolar patients.", "Abstract": "The delineation of dopamine dysfunction in the mentally ill has been a long-standing quest of biological psychiatry. The present study focuses on a recently recognized group of dopamine receptor-interacting proteins as possible novel sites of dysfunction in schizophrenic and bipolar patients. We demonstrate that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia and bipolar cases from the Stanley Foundation Neuropathology Consortium display significantly elevated levels of the D2 dopamine receptor desensitization regulatory protein, neuronal calcium sensor-1. These levels of neuronal calcium sensor-1 were not influenced by age, gender, hemisphere, cause of death, postmortem period, alcohol consumption, or antipsychotic and mood stabilizing medications. The present study supports the hypothesis that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may be associated with abnormalities in dopamine receptor-interacting proteins."}, {"Title": "Internet resources for psychiatry and neuropsychiatry.", "Abstract": "Some of the most useful internet resources relevant to psychiatry and neuropsychiatry are summarised.

As compared with his neuroanatomy, relatively little attention has been paid to Willis' clinical neurology, as described in his Pathologiae Cerebri (1667) and De Anima Brutorum (1672), where he gave a structured account of disease of the nervous system as it was known in his day. His account was largely derived from personal observations and not from traditional authorities and was based around his concept of the animal spirits, a fictitious entity in many ways analogous to the present day idea of the nerve impulse. This concept allowed him to develop a pathology of the animal spirits which embraced the whole content of the clinical neurology and psychiatry of his times. The anatomical and physiological background to Willis' concepts of animal spirit dysfunction, and those disorders he regarded as due to disturbed function of intrinsically normal animal spirits (mainly headache, disorders of consciousness, apoplexy and palsy) are dealt with in the present paper. The disorders he attributed to inherently abnormal animal spirits are considered in a second part of the paper."}]
