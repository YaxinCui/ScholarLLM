[{"Title": "An approach to maximizing treatment adherence of children and adolescents with psychotic disorders and major mood disorders.", "Abstract": "Mental health research has consistently focused on high rates of treatment non-adherence, and how inpatient programs and health professionals can effectively confront this reality. The literature has centred almost exclusively on adult populations. Unfortunately, psychotic and major mood disorders are serious and persistent mental health problems that are increasingly recognized as having an early onset, affecting children and adolescents.\nThis article draws on a review of the literature and Habermas's three domains of knowledge: technical, practical, and emancipatory. This article has incorporated current research, adherence theories, and the facilitation of the unique local expertise of health professionals to generate a framework. This framework is designed to teach health professionals working in child and adolescent psychiatric inpatient units how they and the larger unit can practice to enhance patient treatment adherence during and after admission.\nA five-step approach to teach health professionals to enhance treatment adherence has been developed based on current research and educational theories and principles.\nHealth professionals working in child and adolescent psychiatry can practice to enhance patient treatment adherence, and improve patient and family outcomes."}, {"Title": "Comparison of Clinical Diagnoses, NIMH-DISC-IV Diagnoses and SCL-90-R Ratings in an Adolescent Psychiatric Inpatient Unit: A Brief Report.", "Abstract": "To compare results of clinical diagnosis, NIMH DISC-IV diagnoses and the Global Severity Index of the Symptom Check List- Revised (SCL-90-R) in an adolescent inpatient population.\nNIMH DISC-IV and SCL-90-R were administered to consecutive admissions to the inpatient adolescent unit of a teaching hospital as a regular admission procedure.\nThere was better agreement between clinical diagnosis and the NIMH-DISC-IV diagnosis as compared to previous studies for NIMH DISC-IV.

New long-acting drugs have been developed with this treatment goal in mind.\nPresentations at the 2004 Annual Meeting of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry discussed the development of long-acting drugs for ADHD and clinical studies of their efficacy; these presentations are summarized below.\nConcerta(R) OROS-MPH releases methylphenidate (MPH) in an initial bolus, followed by increasing concentrations throughout the day. This pattern of drug delivery overcomes the development of acute tolerance; classroom analog studies have shown that ADHD symptoms and academic productivity are thereby maintained for 12 hours. A larger open-label study showed that efficacy was maintained through the 12-month study period. An 8-week open-label trial found that OROS-MPH produced significantly higher remission rates than immediate-release MPH (44% vs 16%; p = 0.0002), as well as significantly higher Clinical Global Impression and parent satisfaction scores. Adderall XR(R), an extended-release formulation of mixed amphetamine salts, has recently been withdrawn from the market.\nLong-acting stimulant formulations have dramatically changed the landscape of ADHD practice."}, {"Title": "Transcultural child psychiatry: its history, present status and future challenges.", "Abstract": "To provide a historical review of transcultural child psychiatry in Canada and discuss its future mandate within traditional mental health services.\nTo present a summary of some key papers and chapters in the literature which describe the history and present status of transcultural child psychiatry since its inception 30 years ago.\nThere is a virtual absence of transcultural material in the early editions of the most valued textbooks of child and adolescent psychiatry.

Beginning with the synthesis of malonylurea by von Baeyer in 1864, and up to the decline of barbiturate therapy in the 1960s, it describes the discovery of the sedative properties of barbital, by von Mering and Fischer (1903), the subsequent synthesis of phenobarbital by this same group (1911), and the gradual clinical incorporation of different barbiturates (butobarbital, amobarbital, secobarbital, pentobarbital, thiopental, etc). We describe the role played in therapy by barbiturates throughout their history: their traditional use as sedative and hypnotic agents, their use with schizophrenic patients in so-called \"sleep cures\" (Klaesi, Cloetta), the discovery of the antiepileptic properties of phenobarbital (Hauptmann) and their use in the treatment of epilepsy, and the introduction of thiobarbiturates in intravenous anesthesia (Lundy, Waters). We also analyze, from the historical perspective, the problems of safety (phenomena of dependence and death by overdose) which, accompanied by the introduction of a range of psychoactive drugs in the 1950s, brought an end to barbiturate use, except in specific applications, such as the induction of anesthesia and the treatment of certain types of epileptic crisis."}, {"Title": "The use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of pediatric insomnia in primary care: rational approaches.

In this research, we used the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) to assess the cognitive status of 101 hospitalized patients in an opiate detoxification program. The results reveal that a majority of the tested patients present cognitive abnormalities to varying degrees of severity. Furthermore, these cognitive deficits are correlated with four Addiction Severity Index (ASI) scales (medical, alcohol use, drug use, and psychiatry, respectively). Considering the results, because cognition is a major issue in detoxification and rehabilitation programs, simple cognitive screening (as with the GDS) coupled with a particular interest in some aspects of a patient's anamnesis could lead to better management of opiate-dependent patients."}, {"Title": "[Confusion Assessment Method. Validation of a French-language version].", "Abstract": "There is no systematic or standardized approach to assessing higher mental functions in hospitalized elderly patients, despite the constant presence of nursing staff. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is the only valid and reliable clinical tool for detecting symptoms of delirium easily and quickly, even by health professionals with no specialized training in psychiatry. The CAM has been translated into eight languages, but no validated French-language version has been published as yet. It was in response to this need that the researchers took the first steps in validating a French-language version of the CAM and the diagnostic algorithm, and enhanced the description in French of symptoms of delirium and the criteria of the diagnostic algorithm. The validation process was based on the first two steps in the transcultural validation method for psychological questionnaires suggested by Vallerand. The availability of a French-language version of this instrument will lead to greater professional autonomy and help to simplify the recognition of symptoms of delirium and ensure that the appropriate action is taken sooner."}, {"Title": "NIH State-of-the-Science Conference Statement on manifestations and management of chronic insomnia in adults.", "Abstract": "To provide health care providers, patients, and the general public with a responsible assessment of currently available data on manifestations and management of chronic insomnia in adults.\nA non-DHHS, non-advocate 12-member panel representing the fields of psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, anesthesiology, sleep disorders, geriatric medicine, epidemiology, health services research, nursing, and community medicine.

Little is known about the mechanisms, causes, clinical course, comorbidities, and consequences of chronic insomnia. Evidence supports the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy and benzodiazepine receptor agonists in the treatment of this disorder, at least in the short term. Very little evidence supports the efficacy of other treatments, despite their widespread use. Moreover, even for those treatments that have been systematically evaluated, the panel is concerned about the mismatch between the potential lifelong nature of this illness and the longest clinical trials, which have lasted 1 year or less. A substantial public and private research effort is warranted, including developing research tools and conducting longitudinal studies of randomized clinical trials.

Vijverdal Community Mental Hospital 1969-2004].", "Abstract": "In 1972 the psychiatric hospital 'Vijverdal' opened its doors in Maastricht. The building of this Community Mental Hospital was reported to be 'revolutionary'. Inspired by American architectural concepts about the construction of hospitals, Vijverdal arose as a huge complex with a nine storey radial block of flats: a unique building in Dutch psychiatry. The first reactions were very positive. The imposing flat expressed psychiatric optimism and therapeutic promises. However, confronted by the dynamic developments in psychiatry at the end of the seventies, the hospital more and more appeared to be a therapeutic monstrum: the flat became a symbol of alienation and medical detachment. Adapting it to the new ideas about differentiation and de-concentration appeared difficult, however. Only in 2000 Vijverdal started a fundamental renovation. The flat will be torn down in 2006. This changing evaluation of Vijverdal makes us wonder about the biography of this psychiatric hospital. Which intentions and which psychiatric concepts inspired Vijverdal to be built? How functioned the building environment of Vijverdal in practice? Could the hospital be accommodated to the new notions and wishes about psychiatric care? Moreover, in what way did the architecture determine the history of Vijverdal? And eventually, how are new conceptions about psychiatric care translated in the present renovation and reconstruction of Vijverdal? Do therapeutic promises play a role again? The adventures of Vijverdal tell us about the risks of visionary architecture, but also that a building matters: the psychiatric patients appreciate the new houses and the privacy of a room for their own."}, {"Title": "[Living hysteria--hysteria in every day life and asyum psychiatry around 1900].", "Abstract": "Hysteria has been mostly analysed with reference to the medical and intellectual discourse. The patient's view (Porter) has been solely included on the basis of published case histories. Historians have focussed particularly on the relation between famous psychiatrists or neurologists and \"their\" hysterics. The social circumstances of a maid's mental illness in 1913 are reconstructed. The servant Grete K. was admitted to the Landesheilanstalt Marburg (asylum of Marburg) with the diagnosis of \"depressive hysteria\". Her hysterical malady was traced back to her reading of the novel 'Ich lasse dich nicht' ('I won't let you go') written by the popular novelist Hedwig Courths-Mahler in 1912. Physicians and pedagogues at that time uniformly claimed the reading of pulp fiction to be dangerous for the nerves in general. Elaine Showalter has pointed out that in the 19th century hysteria was spread by \"media infection\". This historical analysis of Grete K.s medical record will seize and improve Showalters suggestion. The analysis of the maid's medical record is a part of a dissertation project on hysteria in every day life and psychiatric practice around 1900. The study has turned the attention on the process of negotiation between psychiatrists and hysterical women."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatric causalties among soldiers in the 20th century with a focus on the Congo 1960-4].", "Abstract": "Psychiatric casualties among soldiers constitute an inevitable part of modem warfare. For the past hundred years Medicine and Society have shown a growing interest in the combat reactions. The focus has shifted from an organic one towards a psychological and psychiatric perspective. Cultural, social, economical and political forces have influenced the scientific development from the Shell shock to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. The aims of this literature review are to describe how military psychiatry has viewed combat reactions and in what way this has affected civil psychiatry and medicine in general, and also to follow the development of the diagnosis PTSD. Furthermore, one aim was to study the events in Congo in 1961 when Swedish UN-soldiers participated in combat. The military and associated psychiatrists has by different means tried to prevent and treat psychiatric casualties, but the knowledge was constantly forgotten and the principles of PIE-treatment (proximity, immediacy, expectancy) had to be reinvented over and over again. The experiences of military psychiatry have in some aspect enriched medical science but did also raise questions. Many factors seem to have interacted in the creation of PTSD and this diagnosis is still being questioned and debated. In 1961 PTSD did not exist and according to a follow-up study by Kettner the Swedish soldiers who suffered psychological combat reaction did not differ significantly from the rest, except that they were younger. This study has shown that the dilemma of either serving the demands of war or the individual is a common feature among military psychiatrists. Second, during the last decades there has been a convergence trend of military psychiatry and civil catastrophe psychiatry. The military psychiatry is now part of the socio-medical movement of psyhcotraumatology. Finally, for every war since World War I physicians and psychiatrists have had to relearn the importance of PIE-treatment."}, {"Title": "[The manuscript codices of Girolamo Mercuriale's works kept in municipal libraries in Cesena, Forli and Ravenna].", "Abstract": "Girolamo Mercuriale (Forli 1530-1606) was a celebrity in his day, not only in the medical field, but in any other branch of humanist learning. He exerted his widespread contacts outside medicine with philological humanists, antiquarians, architects, and artists interested in ancient material and social culture. He studied in Bologna and Padova and taught at Padua (1569-1587), Bologna (1587-1592) and Pisa (1592-1606). He wrote more than twenty printed books, a lot of them derived from lessons gathered by his students. He wrote prolifically on all sorts of subjects, from psychiatry to gynecology, pediatrics, dermatology, toxicology, infectivology, epidemiology, history of medicine. In the Municipal Libraries in Cesena, Forli and Ravenna are kept twelve codices concerning Girolamo Mercuriale's works handwritten between the sixteenth and the seventeenth century. The main body of these works concerns the lectures dictated in Padua, which will merge with the printed texts of the Medicina Pratica and the De morbis mulieribus praelectiones, printed both in Venice respectively in 1603 and 1587. Two codices are autographed and includes notes and reflections on Hippocrates works, a translation into Latin of two Polibio's works (Problemata and De fraterna benevolentia) and the Constitutio of Padua from 1577 till 1578. These codices bear witness to the importance of Mercuriale's work and to the diffusion of his lectures.

In Soviet ideology common interests were declared superior to private ones. Hence, medical confidentiality was viewed as a bourgeois survival. On the other hand, diagnosis was normally not disclosed to a patient in the case of an incurable disease (especially cancer). Due to the strong paternalistic traditions of Russian medicine the idea of informed consent is still disputed by many physicians. Abortions were first legalized in Soviet Russia in 1920. A brief history of this landmark event is provided. However, abortions were forbidden in 1936 and legalized again only in 1955. Active euthanasia was legalized in Soviet Russia in 1922 but for a short period. Federal law regulating human transplantation was adopted only in 1992 and based on the presumed consent model. Until then forensic autopsy and procurement of cadaver organs were viewed as equal procedures. In 1960s-1980s there was a practice of declaring political dissidents insane in their involuntary treatment."}, {"Title": "Olanzapine-induced obesity and diabetes in Indian patients: a prospective trial comparing olanzapine with typical antipsychotics.", "Abstract": "The association of hyperglycaemia and weight gain with the use of atypical antipsychotics has been documented. However, there is still not enough data from India. The fact that Indian patients usually have a lower body weight compared to European and American counterparts makes it difficult to extrapolate available data to the Indian context. The purpose of this study is: (a) To compare the prevalence of hyperglycaemia in schizophrenic patients taking olanzapine with those taking typical antipsychotics, and (b) to follow-up non-diabetic, non-obese schizophrenics on a stable regimen of antipsychotic monotherapy and determine the proportion of patients who develop weight gain, diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance; comparing the effects of olanzapine versus typical antipsychotics. Fifty-five schizophrenic patients attending psychiatry outpatients' department and on stable antipsychotic monotherapy for at least 6 weeks were included in the study. Those with a family or personal history of diabetes were excluded. There were 28 cases on olanzapine and 27 on either haloperidol or trifluoperazine. Fasting blood glucose estimation and body-mass Index (BMI) were recorded at baseline, at 6 weeks, and at 12 weeks. The two groups were comparable with respect to age, genderwise composition, and duration of illness. There was no significant difference in baseline glycaemic status or BMI. At the end of 12 weeks, olanzapine was not associated with any significant change in body weight, BMI or plasma fasting glucose. Duration of use of antipsychotic emerged as the only statistically significant risk factor for developing hyperglycaemia across both groups."}, {"Title": "'Let the heart speak out'--interviewing practices by psychiatrists from two different traditions.", "Abstract": "In the present article, we investigate the extent to which professional theories that underlie, inform, and guide the interviewing practices of two psychiatrists (a neuropsychiatrist and a psychoanalyst) are discursively displayed in their ways of conducting a psychiatric interview. This study analyses excerpts from two audio-recorded psychiatric interviews held at the Institute of Psychiatry of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. It follows theoretical and methodological frameworks derived from interactional sociolinguistics. Ethnographic data and research interviews with both clinicians also ground our discussion. Using frame analysis as a central tool, we found that the psychiatrist who subscribes to a neuropsychiatric orientation displays a concern on assessing the patient's cognitive processes, and shifts topics away from the patient's delusions to (re)introduce the institutional frame of the psychiatric interview. By contrast, the psychiatrist who holds a psychoanalytic orientation towards interviewing not only listens attentively to very personal topics introduced by the patient, but also sustains and develops these topics. Most of all, she proposes and stays within conversational frames. In keeping a dual understanding about their practices in the interview situation, both doctors balance the need to follow the institutional agenda and the need to listen to the patient, despite their different theoretical orientations."}, {"Title": "Exploring dangerous neighborhoods: latent semantic analysis and computing beyond the bounds of the familiar.", "Abstract": "Certain applications require computer systems to approximate intended human meaning. This is achievable in constrained domains with a finite number of concepts. Areas such as psychiatry, however, draw on concepts from the world-at-large. A knowledge structure with broad scope is required to comprehend such domains. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is an unsupervised corpus-based statistical method that derives quantitative estimates of the similarity between words and documents from their contextual usage statistics. The aim of this research was to evaluate the ability of LSA to derive meaningful associations between concepts relevant to the assessment of dangerousness in psychiatry. An expert reference model of dangerousness was used to guide the construction of a relevant corpus. Derived associations between words in the corpus were evaluated qualitatively. A similarity-based scoring function was used to assign dangerousness categories to discharge summaries. LSA was shown to derive intuitive relationships between concepts and correlated significantly better than random with human categorization of psychiatric discharge summaries according to dangerousness. The use of LSA to derive a simulated knowledge structure can extend the scope of computer systems beyond the boundaries of constrained conceptual domains."}, {"Title": "Detecting early signs of psychosis. Vignettes presented to professionals in primary healthcare and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Among personnel in primary healthcare and psychiatric care, the ability to detect early signs of psychosis was examined and compared. Differences due to sex, age, profession or time in the profession were explored. Three different vignettes concerning patients with mental illness were presented to the respondents, and every respondent was to mark what they thought were early signs of psychosis in the vignettes. The findings were compared with a pre-set standard of symptoms and signs. Healthcare personnel from two different administrative districts, Ume\u00e5 and Ornsk\u00f6ldsvik in northern Sweden, participated in the study. The response rate was 77%, but for district nurses in the administrative district of Ume\u00e5 it was only 25%, so therefore complementary interviews with nine district nurses in that district, representing the drop-outs, were performed. There was no difference whatsoever in ability to detect early signs of psychosis between personnel in primary healthcare and psychiatric care; nor were there any significant differences due to sex, age, profession or time in their profession. Detecting early signs of psychosis requires training and the ability to communicate with patients, as well as a special sensitivity to psychiatric conditions. This can be achieved by enhancing accessibility and continuity of primary healthcare for these patients. Furthermore, a greater sensitivity to early signs of psychosis must be created among all healthcare personnel. The co-operation between primary healthcare and psychiatric care must increase. Primary care physicians need opportunities to see patients over time in order to correctly interpret early signs and symptoms of psychiatric illness."}, {"Title": "[Between law and psychiatry: homosexuality in the project of the Swiss penal code (1918)].", "Abstract": "In 1942 the Swiss penal code depenalises homosexual acts between agreeing adults under some conditions. The genesis of the penal article shows that it was constructed before the First World War and bears marks of the forensic theories of the turn of the century. Both by direct contacts and the authority of its eminent figures, Swiss psychiatry exerts an unquestionable influence on the depenalisation. The conceptualisation of homosexuality is also strongly influenced by the German psychiatric theories and discussed in reference to Germanic law.

Writing-up and publishing research findings helps to enhance the reputation of the investigators and the laboratories where the work was done. The number of times an article is cited in the reference lists of other articles is generally accepted as a mark of distinction. Indeed, citation analysis has become widely used in research assessment of individual scientists, university departments and entire nations. This article concerns the most highly cited papers published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences (JFS) between 1956 and 2005. These were identified with the help of Web-of-Science, which is the on-line version of Science Citation Index, produced by Thomson Institute for Scientific Information (Thomson ISI) with head offices in Philadelphia, USA. This database tracks, among other things, the annual citation records of articles published in several thousand scientific journals worldwide. Those JFS articles accumulating 50 or more citations were identified and rank-ordered according to the total number of citations. These articles were also evaluated according to the name of first author, the subject category of the article, the country of origin and the pattern of co-authorship. This search strategy located 46 articles cited between 50 and 292 times since they first appeared in print. The most highly cited paper by far was by Kasai, Nakamura and White (USA and Japan) concerning DNA profiling and the application of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in forensic science. Some forensic scientists appeared as first author on two to three highly cited articles, namely Wetli (USA), Budowle (USA) and Comey (USA). When the highly cited articles were sub-divided into subject category, 15 were identified as coming from toxicology, closely followed by criminalistics (14 articles), pathology (nine articles), physical anthropology (five articles), forensic psychiatry (two articles) and one from odontology. The number of co-authors on these highly cited articles ranged from one to nine and the names of some investigators appeared on as many as four highly cited papers. The vast majority of papers originated from US laboratories although five came from Japan, two each from Sweden and Canada and there was also a joint USA-Swiss collaboration.

It is especially common among medically compromised patients, and is an indicator of the severity of the medical illness. In addition, it is associated with a higher morbidity, mortality, and longer hospitalization. Traditionally, haloperidol has been used to treat agitation as it may occur in delirium. However, atypical antipsychotics are being increasingly used to treat delirium.\nIn this article, we will describe two cases of delirium successfully treated with aripiprazole.\nBoth patients had significant improvement in their delirium as measured by the delirium rating scale.\nAripiprazole appears to be effective in reducing the symptoms of delirium."}, {"Title": "Family attitudes toward transgendered people in Turkey: experience from a secular Islamic country.", "Abstract": "In Turkey, an individual with gender identity disorder is stigmatized and isolated from society.

While 85.1% of the families considered themselves as secular muslims, 14.9% were very religious. They first noticed the gender identity disorder during puberty (70.2%) or prepuberty (17%). In 63.8% it was remarked that it was a shocking experience. One-third of them felt responsible for it. While 65.9% tried to change the situation by coercion, only 27.7% adopted a supportive attitude. The majority of families tried to conceal the situation from their immediate environment and one-third did not even inform their closest relatives. For half of relatives the mass media was their only source of information whereas one-third received information from doctors. Most of the families were satisfied with the treatment. Family members also reported that the conformity of the transgendered relative within the family improved. Of the family members, 40.4% accepted the transgendered identity and approved the sex reassignment surgery as a final step.\nInvolvement of family members in the process of change for the transgendered individual is important for both the family as well as the individual concerned."}, {"Title": "Rethinking somatoform disorders.", "Abstract": "From the very moment of their inclusion in contemporary classification systems in psychiatry, the concept of somatization and diagnostic categories of somatoform disorders became a matter of controversy that created an ongoing debate about their validity, reliability and applicability in clinical and research settings. The aim of this review is to provide an insight into the current theoretical, research and clinical dilemmas in the area of somatoform disorders and to illustrate them with brief summaries of scientific papers recently published in this field.\nIn the period covered by this review, the most valuable scientific contributions to the current state of knowledge on somatoform disorders were (surprisingly numerous) review papers produced by the leading experts in this field. These comprehensive and critical meta-analyses covered historical, conceptual, epidemiological and cross-cultural aspects of somatoform disorders. Another and a relatively smaller group of recently published papers reported on some novel treatment strategies for patients with specific somatoform disorders, their service utilization and health care-related costs.\nIf one were to find a common denominator of the papers covered by this review, it is a general agreement amongst their authors that the current concepts of somatization and somatoform disorders have serious theoretical and practical limitations in both research and clinical settings. They suggest that the time has come to seriously rethink these concepts so as to find better nosological solutions for the forthcoming revisions of classification systems in psychiatry and medicine."}, {"Title": "Atypical depression: Australian and US studies in accord.", "Abstract": "A 2004 review of 'atypical depression' in Current Opinion in Psychiatry could be read as more reifying the Columbian and DSM-IV concept rather than considering an alternative model that has been supported by independent studies undertaken in Australia and North America. Additional analyses of the Australian data set are reported to examine inter-study agreement further and to consider the implications.\nBoth studies recruited patients meeting criteria for a major depressive episode, and then contrasted patients meeting or not meeting DSM-IV criteria for definite atypical depression. In both studies, those with atypical depression were comparable in terms of female preponderance, age, age at first episode and depression severity, but developed earlier and more persistent episodes, showed a slight female preponderance, and were more likely to meet criteria for panic disorder, social phobia and hypochondriasis, and of avoidant and dependent personality styles. In both, there was a lack of evidence suggesting that atypical depression differs in severity, in being clearly less likely to have certain 'endogeneity' symptoms, or in being more likely to be associated with bipolar disorder, while neither the centrality of mood reactivity nor interdependence of symptoms could be demonstrated.\nFindings from both studies challenge the view that atypical depression is an entity and the current model of its constituent features. Both found support for primacy of personality style (rather than mood reactivity) and for certain expressions of anxiety. Both effectively argue for and assist shaping of a revisionist model for conceptualizing atypical depression as a syndrome or spectrum disorder."}, {"Title": "Classical conditioning of endocrine effects.", "Abstract": "Classical conditioning is a form of associative learning, based on the pioneering work of I. P. Pavlov: due to its association with an unconditioned stimulus that induces an unconditioned response, an initially neutral stimulus will become a conditioned stimulus evoking a conditioned response in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus. One important area for the application of conditioning principles is the regulation of physiological systems in general, and endocrine responses and its concomitant changes specifically. Conditioned endocrine responses were predominantly addressed in animal studies so far, mainly examining conditioned insulin production (and blood-glucose change) and corticosterone release.\nThere are very few studies on classical conditioning of endocrine responses in the annual period of this review. The advancement, however, is that some are conducted with humans. Recently, as a new avenue, hormones and neurotransmitters have been examined as mediators of basic conditioning processes. Moreover, there is an increasing interest in gender-specific conditioning responses which are influenced by gonadal hormones.\nResearch on classical conditioning demonstrates that endocrine systems are adaptable to environmental signals. Likewise, the endocrine status of an organism (at least with regard to glucocorticoids and gonadal hormones) was shown to modify classically conditioned responses. Partly due to the high expenditure of conducting conditioning experiments, the quantity of studies is limited, but there is a need to extend this research to humans. In sum, the application of conditioning paradigms constitutes an important research tool for behavioral medicine as well as psychiatry to examine brain-behavior relationships."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric comorbidity in children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "This review critically discusses recent research findings on psychiatry comorbidity in children and adolescent persons.\nSeveral epidemiological studies have confirmed previous findings in relation to the high rates of psychiatric comorbidity in children and adolescents. In particular, psychiatric comorbidity has been detected in children with substance abuse, and with conduct and oppositional defiant, anxiety and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorders. These studies have also investigated the impact comorbidity has on symptom presentation, outcome and service utilization. Although the presence of concurrent psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents is well established, there has been limited research on the need for different treatment modalities in children suffering from more than one disorder.\nIt is widely accepted that children and adolescents frequently present with more than one psychiatric diagnosis. The substantial variation in psychiatric comorbidity found in the literature may be due to the different methods of data collection as well as to the classification system used. Whether children and adolescents fulfil diagnostic criteria for a mixed condition (International Classification of Diseases-10) or multiple disorders (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV), it is important that the concurrent psychopathology be recognized and treated."}, {"Title": "Is it possible to carry out high-quality epidemiological research in psychiatry with limited resources?", "Abstract": "This review covers the epidemiological research from developing countries to identify the scope of research in the various aspects of epidemiology and the strengths of research.

The literature survey used searches of Medline, key psychiatric journals and personal correspondence with leading psychiatric researchers from developing countries.\nThere is a new interest in epidemiological studies in developing countries. These studies have been driven by three factors, namely international collaboration; specific situations like disasters, terrorism and severe acute respiratory syndrome; and international attention to specific topics like maternal depression. There is limited long-term research on specific conditions. There are a number of leads suggesting local social-cultural factors contribute to the distribution of psychiatric problems. Child psychiatry continues to be low in priority. There is also lack of research in areas such as personality disorders and organic psychiatric disorders.\nIt is possible to carry out high quality epidemiological research in developing countries. Such research has provided new insights into the distribution, causation, course and outcome of mental disorders.

The selected papers are categorized with regard to what relevance is given to biographical data in a narrow sense or to conceptual issues for which the biography of a certain author functions as an illustration. Mere hagiographic biographical notes were not taken into consideration, and nor were plain polemics. Although the differentiation mentioned above seems useful in order to get an overview, it is de facto not possible to clearly separate biographical from conceptual aspects. This may be true for all fields in the history of science, but it is definitely true in the history of psychiatry with its numerous long-standing theoretical controversies - many of them still unresolved and all of them closely linked with the lives of their prominent representatives.\nThe biographical approach can be helpful in proving that research on the history of psychiatry--if done beyond mere hagiography or simple polemic--is of crucial importance for the understanding and development of theoretical and practical issues in our field."}, {"Title": "Concepts of recovery: competing or complementary?", "Abstract": "Within the last 5 years, concepts of recovery have taken center stage in psychiatry as the overarching goal of mental health services. In the course of this shift towards recovery, clinicians and consumers (and many others) have struggled to make the concept of recovery both measurable and meaningful. The clinical concept of recovery has focused upon the remission of symptoms and restoration of functioning. A rehabilitation model of recovery has been a more subjective and consumer-oriented concept that focuses on the full lives that are lived within the context of enduring disability.\nA review of the literature addressing the concepts of recovery over the last 2 years demonstrates that authors are rarely explicit about the perspective of recovery from which they are writing. Almost all of the representative papers, however, struggled with how best to define, measure and validate recovery in its broadest terms. Several authors reviewed the history of recovery and offered conceptual discussions of either their first-person experiences or implications for mental health practice. Other authors, regardless of their perspective on recovery, sought to more concretely define criteria for recovery, for the purposes of recovery measure development or more rigorous research of the concept.\nAs authors struggle to reconcile these often competing concepts of recovery, we suggest that both concepts are useful for different purposes and populations and that the synthesis of the two will offer a broader perspective on life with, after, or despite mental illness."}, {"Title": "Philosophy of psychopathology.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry is increasingly aware of its own conceptual foundations and the role that philosophy plays in shaping research and practice. This growing awareness is especially prominent in the area of psychopathology, where both philosophers and psychiatrists are actively investigating the basic assumptions and values that influence the science.\nThere is growing attention to the role of values in understanding both the concepts of psychopathology, and the philosophical assumptions that underlie research strategies for studying it. Provocative work is being done to clarify the concept of 'mental disorder', to identify the influence of values in the classification and diagnosis of psychopathology, and to use values to argue for comprehensive research efforts. Psychometricians increasingly question the interplay between the philosophical theory and empirical study of psychopathology.\nBoth epistemology and value theory are central to the conceptualization and research of psychopathology. This prominence is recognized not only by philosophers and psychiatrists interested in philosophy, but by investigators who must grapple with the mutual influence of philosophical concepts and research methods. By making our philosophical views explicit and maintaining our awareness of them, we are well poised to develop and question both our philosophical and our research methods in meaningful ways."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry, philosophy and the self.", "Abstract": "The aim of this article is to investigate psychopathology in order to illuminate the nature of personal identity.\nPredominantly, the authors reviewed here defend a more robust version of the narrative self against Dennett's claim that narrative self is ultimately a useful fiction.

The former research suggests associations between low folic acid/vitamin B12 status and depression in older adults whereas evidence for other micronutrients is still tentative. In the latter work, there is only one study that examines malnutrition in psychogeriatric patients despite the availability of well-validated screening tools for assessing nutritional state in the elderly and the known impact of undernutrition in ageing and the development of frailty.

However, cultivating what we may call the \"art of psychiatry\" is not straightforward, since the qualities that constitute it are elusive. I propose that the means by which we can accomplish the goal of relating empathically and compassionately to our patients and their families is by regarding the humanities and the sciences as of equal relevance and as complementary. The humanities, particularly literature, the visual arts, film and music, are most suited to promoting empathic skills when they are woven into the clinical scenario. Examples are provided to demonstrate how this may be achieved. Were we to succeed in highlighting the art of psychiatry in our educational programs, and as part of continuing professional development, I surmise that our patients and their families would be the beneficiaries. We cannot merely vow to act empathically and sensitively. Instead, we should embark on a lifelong journey through the wonderful world of literature, the visual arts, film and music.

In addition, little is known about the costs and cost-effectiveness of such interventions in most regions of the world, even though such information is of direct relevance to increased investment and service development. This research report provides an overview of the mental health component of the World Health Organization's CHOICE project, the aim of which is to generate cost-effectiveness evidence for a large number of interventions for leading contributors to disease burden in a range of geographical and epidemiological settings around the world. To date, expected costs (expressed in international dollars) and effects (measured in terms of disability adjusted life years, DALYs) of key pharmacological and psychosocial interventions have been modelled for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and panic disorder. The results of this analysis indicate that the most efficient interventions for common mental disorders (depression and panic disorder) can be considered very cost-effective (each DALY averted costs less than one year of average per capita income), while community-based interventions for more severe mental disorders using older antipsychotic and mood stabilising drugs meet the criterion for being cost-effective (each DALY averted costs less than three times the average annual income).

The emerging consensus in the health field that personal values and the patient's preferences are important in monitoring the quality of medical care outcomes makes it even more important to assess the patient's perspectives. Unfortunately, there is little consensus about what constitutes QOL or how to measure it, particularly in psychotic patients.

Broadly, spirituality relates to interconnectedness, ultimate meaning or life force itself. The current use of the term spirituality in Western cultures derives both from Christian spirituality and 'New Age' thinking, which often appropriates ideas from Eastern religious traditions. The sociocultural roots of this division are complex, involving both growth of individualism, the pursuit of meaning and discontent with materialism and scientific rationalism. This situation is contrasted with other monotheistic religions where there is no distinction between religion and spirituality.

The advent of parenteral formulations of atypical antipsychotics, beginning with ziprasidone in 2002, might afford an alternative treatment option.\nThe objective of this article was to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of i.m. ziprasidone used to treat agitation in elderly patients.\nIn this data analysis, the PES database at the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, School of Medicine, State University of New York, Stony Brook, New York, was searched for records of patients aged > or = 65 years who received a single 20-mg dose of i.m. ziprasidone for the treatment of acute agitation. Efficacy data from these patients were compared with those from an age- and gender-matched sample that received conventional treatment (CT group) with i.m. haloperidol, with or without lorazepam. Data were also included from a previous naturalistic outcomes study to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of i.m. ziprasidone in patients treated at the PES at Stony Brook. Additional records were identified using a search of pharmacy and restraint records for PES-treated geriatric patients who received i.m. ziprasidone over a 2.5-year period beginning in late 2002, when i.m. ziprasidone became available. In some patients in the ziprasidone group, the effects of the drug on agitation were assessed prospectively by blinded psychiatrists using the Behavioural Activity Rating Scale (BARS) (1--difficult or unable to arouse to 7--violent, requires restraint). Also included in the analysis were data concerning use of rescue medication (oral or parenteral) other than the study drug within 2 hours of initial treatment, restraint time, and adverse events (changes in vital sign measurements and electrocardiography [ECG]).\nThe database revealed 15 patients who received ziprasidone (9 men, 6 women; age range, 65-87 years) and 20 patients who were included in the CT sample (13 men, 7 women; age range, 65-88 years). In the 6 cases rated on the BARS, the mean (SE) baseline score was high (6.8 [0.1]), with a decrease to 4.0 (0.4) (P < 0.05) at 45 minutes after study drug administration and to 2.8 (0.4) (P < 0.01) at 120 minutes.

After the fairly tolerant decision policy of the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) in the first half of the 1990s, the criteria of granting disability pensions hassince been made stricter--through replacing of the former disability pensions by the concept of inability to work. The author evaluates the theory and practice of experts' decision-making in the prospect of his over ten year experience as an expert appointed by the Regional Court of Law in Cracow. Mental disorders are rated third among disturbances most frequently indicated as the reason for deciding about long-term inability to work. Psychiatric disorders, unlike most illnesses from other domains of medicine--do not require the use of modern methods of instrumental diagnostics. The only instrument supporting the clinical diagnosis is a psychological examination--especially in regards to the assessment of the depth of intellectual deficit. In psychiatry, clinical diagnosis is of a descriptive character: \"As the district psychiatrist perceives or wants to perceive the patient during the examination--so does he describe this patient in the medical documentation\". It is verification of actual intensity of mental disorders during a short examination--here the examination by a Social Insurance Institution's expert physician or an expert appointed by court--that becomes a problem. Of special importance in decision making must be prescribed to medical documentation, including regularity of treatment, applied pharmacotherapy, hospital treatment and its duration, etc."}, {"Title": "[A few remarks on the so-called war pension].", "Abstract": "The legislator has provided for a possibility of granting war disability pensions to some persons listed in appropriate legal acts. In the area of psychiatry, the most frequently indicated disorder is PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder--formerly KZ-syndrome) manifesting in the form of neurasthenic-depressive-anxiety disturbances. The latest literature on the subject mentions the problem of simulation and meta-simulation of PTSD symptoms and claims that \"... recognition of PTSD as the basis for indemnity ends can take place no sooner that PTSD symptoms have become stable and no sooner than after one year of treatment--with adequate psychological and pharmacological therapy\". Expert practice, however, reveals that applications for war disability pensions with a diagnosis of PTSD mentioned in the application form--are filed by persons who have never been subject to psychiatric treatment before. It often happens that an expert draws up a disability pension form based on one psychiatric consultation. It seems fully justified to state that after half a century, which has passed since the end of the war and occupation, it is impossible to verify the causal nexus between the disorders suffered by the living combatants and the psycho-physiological injuries inflicted upon them many decades ago. Another thesis, suggesting that it would be justified to grant war disability pensions in all such cases, seems to be of discrete character and therefore appears incompatible with the nature of opinioning."}, {"Title": "[Pharmacovigilance as new direction of research].", "Abstract": "Pharmacovigilance: permanent collection and assessment of the safety data of the drug, in the interest of precise knowledge of the safety profile of the pharmacon; permanent collection of unexpected adverse drug reactions, effects on special patient populations, drug interactions, adverse drug reactions of long-term treatment, adverse drug reactions of long latency.

Whereas experts maintain that traumatic events--those experienced as overwhelmingly terrifying at the time of their occurrence--are remembered all too well, traumatic amnesia theorists disagree. Although these theorists acknowledge that trauma is often seemingly engraved on memory, they nevertheless maintain that a significant minority of survivors are incapable of remembering their trauma, thanks to mechanisms of either dissociation or repression. Unfortunately, the evidence they adduce in support of the concept of traumatic dissociative amnesia fails to support their claims.

People requiring intervention have different levels of need, ranging from the provision of basic information to long-term, individualized treatment. We address this clinical need by outlining a five-level \"progressive intervention\" approach to the management of tinnitus that would provide a systematic framework for treatment by audiologists. At each level, patients must be appropriately referred-usually to otolaryngology, psychology, and/or psychiatry. Level 1 is an interview method of screening for determining if the person requires clinical intervention (and addressing basic questions). Level 2 is the provision of structured group educational counseling. If the screening determines that care is urgently required or if further help is needed following the group session(s), a tinnitus intake assessment (Level 3) should be performed. The intake assessment, which includes educational counseling, can often meet a patient's needs. If not, then a program of continuing treatment (Level 4) would be indicated. If significant benefit were not achieved through consistent treatment over 1-2 years, longer-term treatment (Level 5) would be indicated, which could include alternate or multiple treatment modalities.

In this way the data of 106 children were included in the statistical analysis.\nComorbidity: Based on the M.I.N.I. Kid test comorbid diagnoses were found in 74.53% of the children and 51.90% of the children with comorbid diagnoses had three or more concomitant diagnoses. The maximum number of diagnoses obtained concomitantly by the M.I.N.I. Kid was 9. The M.I.N.I. Kid produced 2.58 diagnoses for one child on average.

The subjects discussed covered monitoring of risk factors, education about lifestyle and the risk of diabetes, patient care and treatment options, and interfaces between psychiatry and diabetology. The workshop noted that all patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia had an elevated risk of developing diabetes and that this needed to be reflected in the follow-up of the patients in order to reduce the chances of the emergence of disease. The risk of diabetes is complicated by the presence of other risk factors and the intensity of the diabetes prevention programme needs to reflect adequately the overall risk. The most important prevention methods relate to lifestyle changes that patients with schizophrenia may be spontaneously unlikely to adopt and therefore necessitate the implementation of specific education measures aimed at patients and their families. The workshop proposed follow-up intensities, monitoring procedures and prevention programmes stratified according to the risk of developing diabetes.

This is the first documented general anesthesia in the world. Numerous studies have been made about Seishu Hanaoka during the past 100 years and among them the monograph titled \"Seishu Hanaoka and His Surgery\" by Shuzo Kure published in 1923, had been thought to be nearly perfect and it had been thought that nothing had been left unsolved concerning the biography of Hanaoka. The present author made an exhaustive investigation of the monograph in terms of anesthesiology and found a serious forgery in the transcription of Hanaoka's \"Nyugan chiken roku\". The author also detected two forged photographs of the record in Kure's book. As Kure was a professor of psychiatry of the Tokyo Imperial University and a leading medical historian at that time, other investigators of Hanaoka followed him unquestioningly and they could not reveal Kure's forgery for 80 years since its publication. Because of Kure's forgery the biographical study of Hanaoka was retarded seriously and incorrect information about him has prevailed. The cause of the academic retardation is considered to have been mainly due to the lack of a bibliographical survey of original documents of Hanaoka by following investigators."}, {"Title": "Toward a \"new\" paradigm of therapeutic action: neuro-psychoanalysis and downward causation.", "Abstract": "Freud's metapsychological assumption, which split the mind from the brain, is increasingly recognized as limiting the growth of psychoanalysis and its integration with other fields, including psychiatry. The dual-aspect monist position, sometimes used to rationalize the mind/body split, is seen to contain a mereological (category) error, which can be avoided by the introduction of the paradigm of psychodynamic science, and by the use of a nondualistic, symbiotic mind/brain formulation, well justified by the study of cultural and organic evolution. Therapeutic action may now be seen as a special case of development that occurs within the interactional context of cultural evolution, personal history, and the genome. Human evolution is increasingly dominated by culture operating on the mind/brain through downward causation. This concept refers to the influence of higher organizational entities (e.g., mind) upon lower ones (e.g., brain). Although little recognized, downward causation is tacitly assumed in psychotherapeutic interventions, and is illustrated in recent fMRI studies. The clinical integration of the downward causation concept links therapeutic action to the power of cultural evolution, and facilitates reunion with traditional science."}, {"Title": "Integrated medical-psychiatric care of a dying borderline patient: a case of dynamically informed \"practical psychotherapy\".", "Abstract": "Combined training in family practice and psychiatry is relatively new and consists of equal proportions of each specialty intermixed throughout a 5-year period.

The patient presented in this article had several medical and psychiatric problems and was treated by a combined family practice-psychiatry resident who cared for her medically and psychiatrically until the time of her death from cancer. Complex patients such as this defy the use of purely applied school-specific psychotherapies. Rather, they require the creative application of integrated psychotherapeutic strategies.

Different techniques for functional and anatomical examination are currently clinically implemented in neurology and psychiatry to improve sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the diagnosis of various diseases. In addition, the increasing life expectancy in the Western world raises the social importance and the economical impact of age-related neurodegenerative disorders since the incidence of Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease is higher in the elderly. An early diagnosis of neuro-psychiatric diseases and the assessment of \"natural\" changes of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) distribution during normal aging are hence of utmost importance. In the recent past brain disorders have extensively been investigated by means of optimised nuclear medicine techniques, instruments and algorithms. Diagnosis can be better achieved by identifying those structures in which CBF or metabolism deviate from normality resulting in significant changes as compared to a reference database. In the present paper we present some studies investigating, by means of recently implemented diagnostic tools, patients bearer of various neuro-psychiatric disorders.

Up to 1940 they were employed as antiseptics, antihelminthics and antimalarials (Ehrlich, Schulemann, Gilman). Finally, in the context of research on antihistaminic substances in France after World War II (Bovet, Halpern, Ducrot) the chlorpromazine was synthesized at Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc Laboratories (Charpentier, Courvoisier, Koetschet) in December 1950. Its introduction in anaesthesiology, in the antishock area (lytic cocktails) and \"artificial hibernation\" techniques, is reviewed (Laborit), and its further psychiatric clinical introduction in 1952, with initial discrepancies between the Parisian Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce (Laborit, Hamon, Paraire) and Sainte-Anne (Delay, Deniker) hospital groups. The first North-American publications on chlorpromazine took place in 1954 (Lehmann, Winkelman, Bower). The introduction of chlorpromazine in the USA (SKF) was more difficult due to their strong psychoanalytic tradition. The consolidation of the neuroleptic therapy took place in 1955, thanks to a series of scientific events, which confirmed the antipsychotic efficacy of the chlorpromazine.\nThe discovery of the antipsychotic properties of chlorpromazine in the 1950s was a fundamental event for the practice of psychiatry and for the genesis of the so-called \"psychopharmacological revolution.\""}, {"Title": "[Depression, yesterday, today and tomorrow: historical evolution of concepts].", "Abstract": "Depressive thoughts have been apparent since the origins of humanity. References to depressive thoughts can be found in philosophical writings and other literature since antiquity.

With the advent of psychiatry as a medical discipline, depressive syndromes were integrated into classifications of mental disorders. The definition of depression is multifactorial, integrating psychosocial, social and biological factors. In this article we use an historical perspective to describe the sociological, psychopathological and biological concepts relating to depressive illness. Over one century, the sociology of mental illness has evolved from the Durkheimian position to psychosocial models which incorporate environmental stressors, social support and coping mechanisms. Psychology encompasses psychoanalytical, cognitive-behavioural and phenomenological theories.

Studies were identified by using MEDLINE (English language articles published from 1967 to March 2005; keywords: sequential treatment, drugs and psychotherapy, combined treatment related to depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, mania, anxiety disorders, panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder) and a manual search of the literature and Index Medicus for the years 1960 to 2005.\nIn unipolar recurrent depression, the sequential use of pharmacotherapy was found to reduce relapse rate. In bipolar disorder, the use of psychotherapeutic strategies in patients who were already undergoing treatment with mood stabilizers was also found to yield clinical benefits. In anxiety disorders, the sequential use of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy was not found to improve long-term outcome.\nThe sequential treatment of mood and anxiety disorders does not fall within the realm of maintenance strategies. It is an intensive, 2-stage approach, which is based on the fact that one course of treatment with a specific treatment (whether pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy) is unlikely to entail solution to the complex array of symptoms of patients with mood and anxiety disorders.

Even if all symptoms of its acute phase have disappeared completely, it is customary to use the terms say \"remission\" instead of \"cured\". The chief reason why they have been unwilling to say \"cured\" is that, even if the present state seems to be \"cured\", there will be surely another attack in near future, so, the non-symptomatic state should not be understood as \"cured\". Whether schizophrenic patients can be cured or not is one of the great problems of modern psychiatry. Is there no probability for them to be cured? Recently, after a 30 years gap, I came to meet a man who had had a schizophrenic attack of the psychomotoric type when he was 25 years old and had been sent to the mental hospital where I had been at work and, by chance, had engaged in his treatment. After about 5 months' of acute state, he came at, so to speak, \"Residualzustand\" (Conrad) for about 1 year and then got insight into his psychosis. After the discharge, he had visited me as an outpatient once a month regularly. About one year thereafter, the change of my work place made us separate from each other. Since then, he stopped visiting the doctor and also stopped taking anti-psychotic drugs. He married at 29 years old and had 2 daughters and a son. In addition, he had started to work for his father's business. After his father's death, he became the owner of 5 shops and the supervisor of 50 workers. Is he not yet \"cured\"? Is he only in the state of \"remission\" even now? According to the principle of Kraepelin and Bleuler, he is not \"cured\" yet, because he will surely have a psychotic exacerbation in future. I wonder then, what is the difference of the two concepts of \"remission\" and \"cured\", and how is it possible to change \"remission\" to \"cured\"? Even Bleuler, E. has written in his world-famous textbook that the longer the duration of remission after the last attack, the smaller the probability of the next attack, and that after about 5 years free of attack, another exacerbation would be very improbable. Supported by the experiences of Utena, Miya and so forth, I proposed a thesis that if a person who had undergone schizophrenic attack has been in complete remission for more than 10 years, he can surely be counted as \"cured\". To verify this probability about the outcome of schizophrenia, it is very important for us to observe any patient who has attained the state of complete remission, and to describe and report his state thereafter as long enough as"}, {"Title": "[Specialists teams for trauma-related disorders--in short supply in Sweden.

Fifty percent of the public medical service areas do not have specialist clinics for treatment of trauma related disorders.

The prevalence of bipolar spectrum disorder in young adults in Switzerland is 11%. In Holland the 6-month prevalence of mania in adolescents was 1.9% and of hypomania 0.9%. Only 1.2% of hospitalized youth (<15 years) in Denmark and 1.7% of adolescents in Finland had BD.

Research indicates that information disclosure reduces stress among patients and that the more patients desire relevant information, the more stress-reductive information disclosure may be. In psychiatry, too, studies have shown that educating psychiatric patients may not necessarily reduce compliance or increase relapse rate. These findings are in line with patients' desires and their legal right to know their own medical matters. It has long been believed that patients, be they psychiatric or non-psychiatric, should be protected and not given information that would potentially cause distress or harm to them.

Essentially, the symptoms were assessed via psychiatric examinations and through the medical history of the patients. The data collected by the study were analyzed statistically by using the SPSS and Chi Square test.\n94% of all patients were hospitalized as being in an emergency situation, 6% were wrongly diagnosed and transferred into a relevant medical institution. 41% of patients were hospitalized at the point of crisis (with police and emergency medical staff), while the most frequent condition was exacerbation of schizophrenia (22.4%). Of the 94% of patients, 17.9% were suicide attempters, while the group at greatest risk was the youngest (18-24), although this group represents 4.5% of total. The other risk factors were male gender, age 30-49 years, single or divorced, and lower socioeconomic status. The most frequent means of attempted suicide was intoxication with medication.

That fusion can be observed in private circumstances as well as in society at large. Children and young people as well as women and men can fall victim to that phenomenon. Eventually, due to gender stereotyping, the awareness of the victimization of the male gender is somewhat weak. In the social-political discourse the male is seen as dominant and powerful and the female gender as the weak one. Sexual violence and/or domination therefore is interpreted as mirroring the genderized balance of power in society. Otherwise the phenomenon is very complex and cannot be explained by simplistic or one-dimensional interpretations. In respect of definitions it is necessary to separate \"sexual violence\", as an aspect of sexual behavior, and \"sexualized power\". The latter means the use of sexuality for the display of power and violence. That kind of fusion is visible in all kinds of interactions--on the private level as well as in the sense of \"structural power\" (like in war, torture, etc.). To theory and practice of psychiatry and psychotherapy the situation brings a whole series of objectives. On the one hand these disciplines have the task to study the phenomenon in different contexts and to contribute to the understanding of the psychic and psychosocial processes which lead to the fusion of the drives. On the other hand it is their obligation to treat the victims of sexual trauma. In recent times much insight has been gained in that context. Nevertheless there has to be much future work done, to understand the phenomenon more deeply and to develop adapted and efficient concepts for prevention and treatment."}, {"Title": "Development of a registry for monitoring psychotropic drug prescriptions: aims, methods and implications for ordinary practice and research.", "Abstract": "In psychiatry, individual-based registries have provided key information on risks and benefits associated with the use of psychotropic drugs but they have rarely been employed for monitoring and evaluating the everyday prescribing of psychopharmacological treatments. This article describes the cultural background that gave impetus to the idea of registering all prescriptions of psychotropic drugs dispensed by physicians working in the South Verona community mental health service, and presents the methodology employed to develop such a registry in a community psychiatric service where a psychiatric case register (PCR) has been operating since 1978. We developed a registry including every patient receiving psychotropic medications in ordinary practice. This registry is linked to the PCR in order to obtain data on social and demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, use of services, and outcomes. No exclusion criteria are allowed--anyone receiving treatment is automatically included. This system, which can link drug and service-use data with hard outcome indicators, can generate information on the proportion of subjects discontinuing treatment, switching medication because of side-effects, recovery or inefficacy, as well as on the proportion of subjects failing to return to the physician, and the proportion of patients who improve. The innovative aspect of this approach is that this registry is developed, organized and used by physicians interested in monitoring their clinical practice and in providing patients, relatives and the public with accurate information on drug use in their specific context of care."}, {"Title": "[Brief intervention for alcohol related problems can be used at various environments].", "Abstract": "Brief intervention for alcohol related problems is effective.

The evolution in clinical practices, a better efficiency in therapeutic procedures and the fundamental right of the patient to obtain information have initialised the discussion of its interest. Spontaneous claim for information from the patient is rarely observed although awareness troubles might be reported at the instauration of the mental disorder or during its evolution. Methodological studies concerning the diagnostic announcement are limited. Except the Bayle studies recently published, only a few publications are available in France about the knowledge of their pathology and their need to be clearly informed. French scientific literature deals generally about medico-legal aspects of this information and consisted of survey about diagnostic announcement. International literature is more abundant and presents positive and negative aspects of the announcement. An information procedure of schizophrenia announcement to the patient has been developed in our hospitalisation unit of psychiatry. This procedure has taken place on the basis of the literature data, our specificity and our clinical experiences. For some Anglo-American psychiatrists who have proceeded to semi-structured interview in order to announce the diagnostic, information to the patients might improve the clinical relationship. Thus, compliance to the treatment is significantly increased. The ability of the patient to recognise the symptoms of the disease and to accept their consequences and the treatments is associated to a better social prognosis, daily activities and response to the treatment. The announcement impact justifies the prescription of neuroleptics, treatment that is notoriously perceived as prejudicial by the patients themselves or more commonly in the basic population. To obtain compliance to the treatment, a satisfactory acceptance of the mental disorder is required. Compliance is based on satisfactory information in order to gain the cooperation of the patient and its relative (10). Atkinson has classified four main types of arguments, the ethical principle to be informed, talk to explain and give sense to the symptoms, reduce the feeling of guilt perceived by the patient and his relative and enhance the collaboration between the patient and the nursing staff. According to Ferreri and Bayle studies French psychiatrists reluctance to announce schizophrenia diagnostic are the following: lack of request or of interrogations asked by the patient about their disease, diagnostic and prognosis uncertainty and irreversibility of the disease, complexity of the pathology and its origin which hinder an accessible explanation, cognitive disorders frequently observed with schizophrenic patients which may be associated with difficulties of understanding information, destabilization of the patient-nursing staff relationship and social stigmatisation risks. Other arguments like reluctance to give a \"label\" to the disease, too abstract diagnostic, a negative social vision and the possibility of discouragement for the relative are classically retrieved in French literature. In fact, divulgation of the term schizophrenia involves a panel of negative representations and is hindered by the confusion in the social imagination of such a term related with lost of control, quintessence of madness, dangerous behaviour possibilities, evil and incurability. Some psychiatrists do not transmit information arguing that significant obstruction of the future may be consecutive to the information. They prefer to use vague terms more socially acceptable like \"nervous breakdown or depression, atypical or emotional disorder, dissociative troubles...\". Information to the patient about his mental disorder is more frequent in psychiatry for affective, anxious and additive troubles than for schizophrenia. Our procedure of diagnostic announcement has been elaborated after preliminary discussion with the medical and nursing staff. Diagnostic of schizophrenia announcement has been presented by weighing the pros and cons according to the intemational literature. It clearly appeared that benefits for the patients prevail on the drawbacks. Nevertheless, inclusion and clinical supervision have to be carefully precised in particular to verify the ability to receive information. Short term objectives: deliver progressively information to the patient about his disease by means of an active and educational process with hope and optimism using a accessible language (explanation of each terms used with the intention of being well understood); quantify the impact of diagnostic announcement on the schizophrenic patient using clinical rating scales during a period of one month (clinical interview at day 1, day 7 and day 28). Mid term objectives: improve the global supervision and autonomy of schizophrenic by means of a therapeutic project helping the patient to become an active partner in the monitoring of his mental disorder; enhance a psycho-educational program after the procedure of announcement in order to optimise the observance of his treatment, increase his quality of life and answer to the requests of his relative; 45 patients (age 29.3 +/- 8.8 years old) have been included to be informed on their diagnostic since the elaboration of this procedure during a time period of 24 months. Time interval between the beginning of their pathology and the delivering of this information was 4.7 years. Most of them (56%) presented a paranoid type of schizophrenia. In most of the cases, the patients did not know their diagnostic or declared suffering from a diagnostic, which was erroneous; 80% of the 45 patients have complied with the procedure until its end. On more than 24 of following after the instauration of the diagnostic announcement procedure, these patients ha ve presented satisfactory observance to the medical supervision (medical consultation and drug intake); 60% of the patients were regularly present to their medical appointment. The number of patients included (45 patients) appears small compared to the time interval of the study (24 months) but was significant according to the great changes in our clinical approach. Thus, this procedure was not systematically applied, in particular the patients who did not want to be informed on their disease. Is it clinically relevant or not to announce diagnostic of schizophrenia to the patient? This issue remains questioned according to the few studies published at the present time, any consensus has been clearly presented on formal indications or contra-indications. If on an ethical side, this information appears logical, the medical and nursing staff should require special care. Special care must be taken before delivering information to the patients; each situation must be evaluated in order not to comply with an ideology of total and inadequate information, which could have serious consequences. Nevertheless, it appeared clearly that information must be given to stabilized patients with satisfactory insight. Moreover, psychotherapeutic projects become easier because patients awareness and understanding towards pathological symptoms are greatly improved. Partnership between patient and medical staff is the key of this dynamic and psycho-educative procedure, which opens new horizons in our therapeutic prospect."}, {"Title": "[Study on psychiatric disorders and defensive process assessed by the \"defense style questionnaire\" in sterile males SAMPLE consulting in andrology].", "Abstract": "The literature about artificial insemination and the associated psychological, psychiatric and sexual disorders is relatively rich. But the majority of these studies is made in gynaecology, with a feminine approach of the disorder. There are very few works led in andrology. This justified the investigation of new trails in order to understand better the clinical context of the sterile man. We undertake a study about the psychiatric disorders among sterile men and about the defense styles. These are a clinical entity recently introduced in the quantitative psychopathology research. The defense style questionnaire (DSQ) is a psychometric scale used in common practice in order to measure the defense styles.\nWe made this study in order to examine the psychiatric state of a sterile males sample consulting in andrology; to assess the defense style by means of the Bond and al DSQ-88 ; to look into a difference between the defensive process according to their clinical situation of azoospermic males or as the oligoazoospermic males and finally, to reveal a correlation between the psychiatric disorders developed in this sample of sterile males and the defensive process they used.\nThere were 42 people (22 azoospermic males and 20 oligoazoospermic males) aged between 23 and 49 years old in the analysed sample. These have been selected at the surgery of andrology at the RUHC of Lille, depending on their arrival order for 6 months. There was no significant difference between the two groups as far as the age and the education standard are concerned. The selection criteria were medical and somatic. Our sample population were divided into two groups: azoospermia (no spermatozoon found in the semen analysis) and oligoasthenospermia (decrease of the number and the mobility of the spermatozoa and an increase of the percentage of atypical forms). The method first consisted in the DSQ, followed by the analysis of the psychiatric state according to the DSM IV, a hetero questionnaire to collect some general information about infertility and a self questionnaire about the sexual, conjugal and social effects of infertility. The DSQ and the interviews took place in the andrology department with the same investigator trained for this job.\nWe found in our sample 26.2% of psychiatric disorders according to the DSM IV with a significant over-representation of generalized anxious disorder and somatization disorder. The comparison between azoospermic males and oligoazoospermic males patients showed the absence of significative difference as far as psychiatric morbidity rate and the use of defense styles are concerned.\nOur sample defended himself in accordance with modalities similar to the general population and used defense mechanisms preferentially belonging to the mature defense style, such as humor, repression and anticipation. The psychiatric pathology was significantly correlated to the preferential use of withdrawal, consumption, reaction formation and lack of humor use. We also confirm in our study the fact that the subjects using especially neurotic defense styles are more likely to develop a psychiatric disorder than the others. Our male sample is a waiting population and threatened by failure. The situation of wait creates anxiety. We also know that infertility is one of the most stressful situations a couple might face. However, our study did not enable us to know the precise relations between generalized anxious disorder and infertility, especially whether the generalized anxious disorder preceded this pathology or not. The over-representation of a somatization disorder only allows us to acknowledge its existence. We can also deduce from that a possible link between infertility and psychic disorder, even if no research permitted to affirm to date the existence of interrelations linking infertility and psychic life. On the whole, this population was suffering despite 73.8% of the patients had no confirmed psychiatric disorder. It is the reason why a liaison psychiatry more inserted into highly specialized teams is interesting, especially because it includes a medical and psychological approach of such disorders. The defense mechanisms preferentially used by this population were humor, repression and anticipation. Humor can only be considered as a defense mechanism when it is applied to oneself. The population who has no psychiatric disorder more uses humor. Does humor protect against the development of a psychiatric pathology, as certain authors proved it ? On the other hand, is repression really protective? It didn't interfere in our study about the development of a psychiatric pathology. So we can suppose that repression was protective for our whole sample, but we can not prove it. However, we wonder if this mechanism works after the failure of an artificial insemination is announced. In which measure such a stress can be repressed out of the conscience field? As for anticipation, it is used by our population who is for the most part in good health. But the question is to know if our sample really envisaged all the different possible solutions or only the success of artificial insemination. As some other works, we confirm that the, psychiatric, people significantly use the neurotic style. Our psychiatric patients used less humor and more consumption, withdrawal and reaction formation than the sane people. Consumption is rarely considered as a defense mechanism by some other authors. And yet, consumption and the existence of psychiatric disorders were very closely linked. This association is found again with anxiety in other studies. The correlation between psychiatric disorder and withdrawal was veryimportant too. The DSM lV defines withdrawal as an apathetic withdrawal. It is not an apathetic withdrawal in our population because the average scores for the ,, activity >, defense mechanism remained high. In our sample, the use of this defense mechanism would encourage the expression of psychiatric troubles. The reaction formation quoted by Freud and Bergeret are both valorised in our society. What kinds of reaction formations use these men ? Are they pathological ? Our study can not answer to these questions. However, the DSQ items examining the reaction formation present its \"socially promoted\" aspect and forget the pathological one. It has been showed that the evaluation of the defense modalities in a certain type of population can allow the emergence of specific defense mechanisms. This can be considered as predictive factors of development of a mental pathology. The evaluation of specific mental defenses could permit to define vulnerability and affinity for given affections instead of simple personality traits or profiles. Most part of the works shows results in favour of the capacity of DSQ to assess the different defense mechanisms according to the diagnosis groups. But the insufficient numbers of studies moderate on the whole the hypothesis of the existence of specific defense mechanisms--protective factors and factors of vulnerability--linked to a given psychiatric disorder.\nThere is not a difference of psychological effect in terms of degree of sterility. On the other hand, the existence of over-represented psychiatric disorders with sterile males compared with a control group force Consultation-Liaison psychiatrists and andrologists would be able to understand the pain beyond the need of acting by the artificial insemination. In our opinion, this justifies the fact that the patients should have the opportunity of expressing, in the department where they are treated, all the feelings inherent to their personal and conjugal drama as part of a specialized treatment. Our study confirms the difficulty to know whether some defense mechanisms are vulnerability factors for a certain psychiatric disorder or whether the defense mechanisms are an epiphenomenon of a particular psychiatric disorder. This is the reason why a lot of authors having worked with DSQ agree to conclude that additional prospective studies, which would permit to make a link between the defense mechanisms anda certain psychiatric pathology, are necessary. In the case we study, it is important to explore the defensive modalities before the infertility diagnosis and after the birth of a child, with a more important sample population. A better knowledge of the defensive modalities of such a population, used in a psychotherapeutic context could help to prevent the appearance of psychiatric disorders or, if not, to anticipate them."}, {"Title": "Control of ACTH secretion by excitatory amino acids: functional significance and clinical implications.", "Abstract": "The involvement of excitatory amino acids in the control of ACTH release is well established. Activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors has a stimulatory effect on ACTH release, while the role of metabotropic receptors is not yet understood in detail. Glutamatergic regulation of ACTH release has a clear significance for the stress response and neuroendocrine functions during development. A dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis has been reported in several psychiatric and neurological disorders. So far, only fractional indices on the clinical importance of the interaction between glutamate and ACTH secretion have been obtained in both preclinical and clinical studies. Some antidepressant drugs, such as tianeptine, which were found to modulate ACTH release, appear to interfere with brain glutamatergic system. Changes in ACTH and cortisol release may be of importance for mood stabilizing effects of antiepileptic drugs modulating glutamate release, such as lamotrigine. Brain glutamate and HPA axis interaction seems to be of importance in alcohol and drug abuse. Little information is available on ACTH release in response to glutamate-modulating drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia and Alzheimer disease. Nevertheless, pharmacological interventions influencing interaction between glutamate and the HPA axis are promising treatment possibilities in psychiatry and neurology."}, {"Title": "A four-step approach for developing diagnostic tests in psychiatry: EEG in ADHD as a test case.", "Abstract": "A four-step approach for developing diagnostic tests in psychiatry is proposed.

The average PD: RPC workload ratio was 80:20. Three programs allowed for 50% of the program director's time to be dedicated to serving that position, with an average time dedication of 37%.\nThe position of PD in psychiatry requires an average of 37% of the program director's time, while carrying an estimated 82% of the administrative workload. The program domain manager administration system implemented at Queen's University enabled the PD to be simultaneously up to date with all major areas of the program while experiencing a substantial decrease in the administrative workload, achieved through increased work contribution of the RPC. This system encourages closer involvement of RPC members in decision making and development of their program domains, allowing the PD more time for developing, implementing and overseeing innovations across the RTP spectrum. Furthermore, it has led to a PD: RPC workload shift from a ratio of 90:10 to one of about 60:40. Essentially, this resulted in a more efficient and adaptable RPC and RTP."}, {"Title": "Improving recruitment and funding in psychiatry by teaching college undergraduates.", "Abstract": "To explore attitudes among leaders in psychiatric training about the usefulness of teaching college undergraduates about psychiatry and to assess benefits in recruitment and funding.\nA survey of current practices and beliefs was sent to most adult and child psychiatry residency training directors (RTDs) and Chairs of academic departments of psychiatry in the U.S.). A follow-up survey was then sent to RTDs at responding programs that teach undergraduates. Interviews were also conducted with education experts to learn about the potential financial benefits of teaching undergraduates.\nOf the 289 (64%) respondents to the first survey, 237 (82%) expressed that teaching undergraduates might or would lead to increased recruitment. All RTDs at responding programs that offered courses answered the second survey, and four reported that undergraduate teaching brings in revenue. Experts confirmed the financial feasibility of these courses.\nUndergraduate psychiatry courses may increase overall recruitment and provide financial benefits for the departments that offer such courses."}, {"Title": "Residency programs and psychotherapy competencies: a survey of chief residents.", "Abstract": "To survey chief residents' opinion about various aspects of psychotherapy competency determination.\nChief residents of various psychiatry residency programs were surveyed.\nOne hundred two chief residents were surveyed. Seventy two (70.58%) completed the survey. Eighty four percent of the respondents reported that they were aware of the competencies. The number of patients required for competency determination in five areas of psychotherapy varied widely among the programs. Global assessment by psychotherapy supervisors was the most commonly used method of competency determination (61%). Nineteen (26%) chief residents opined that not all the faculty members involved in teaching and assessing competencies are qualified to do so. Only 23 (31%) of respondents reported that competency criteria were well integrated into the residency curriculum.\nThe little consistency in psychotherapy competency determination across various programs, the differential preparedness of programs for competencies and the lack of consistent integration of competencies into residency curricula call for development and implementation of more uniform assessment methods. This variability also calls into question the decision to establish a standard in five areas of psychotherapy competency."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry resident graduate comfort with general medical issues: impact of an integrated psychiatry-primary medical care training track.", "Abstract": "To determine if a psychiatry-primary medical care (PPMC) training track impacts comfort and behaviors related to addressing general medical issues after residency.\nThirty five psychiatry resident graduates completed mailed surveys; nine of them had completed the PPMC track.\nCompared to non-PPMC participants, PPMC participants felt better prepared to address medical issues and tended to perform more consultations and feel more comfortable referring patients to general medical providers.

The interaction effect was significant for knowledge only (pretest scores for students in the live group were slightly lower at pretest than those for students in the videotape group and slightly higher at posttest). The effect size was very small, however, suggesting little meaningful educational difference between the two instructional methods.\nBoth live demonstration and viewing a videotape appear to be effective methods for teaching medical students about ECT."}, {"Title": "Professionalism deficits among medical students: models of identification and intervention.", "Abstract": "This study compares the instruments and interventions utilized to identify and remediate unprofessional behaviors in medical students across U.S. psychiatry clerkships.\nA 20-item questionnaire was distributed to 120 psychiatry clerkship directors and directors of medical student education, in the U.S., inquiring into the procedures utilized for identifying, monitoring, and remediating unprofessional behaviors among medical students during their psychiatry clerkship.\nFifty seven (47.5%) clerkship directors responded to the questionnaire. Professionalism is evaluated by 96% of the clerkships with the most frequent goals being to provide feedback to students and to specifically identify problematic behaviors. Seventy percent of the clerkships identify one to three students per year with unprofessional behaviors that warrant intervention. The majority (86%) of the respondents note that unprofessional behaviors may impede the advancement of students during their medical education. A recommendation for a mental health evaluation occurs in at least 76% of cases. Dismissal from medical school for unprofessional behaviors is most likely recommended based on the severity and/or repetitiveness of the acts.\nThere is concordance among clerkship directors regarding the importance of identifying unprofessional behaviors among medical students although there exists a range of modalities for monitoring, remediating, and disciplining such behaviors."}, {"Title": "Characteristics of combined family practice-psychiatry residency programs.", "Abstract": "To evaluate how family practice-psychiatry residency programs meet the challenges of rigorous accreditation demands, clinical supervision, and boundaries of practice.\nA 54-question survey of program directors of family practice-psychiatry residency programs outlining program demographic data, curricula, coordination, resident characteristics, integration, and overall satisfaction was mailed to 11 combined family practice psychiatry-residency programs.\nPrograms surveyed were meeting residency review committee (RRC) requirements, and a majority of the program directors believe that the training is as good as or better than categorical programs, and categorical residents benefited from training alongside combined residents.\nTraining programs are growing in size and producing quality physicians."}, {"Title": "The spectrum of informed consent in emergency psychiatric research.", "Abstract": "I evaluate the variation in requirements for informed consent in studies evaluating chemical tranquilization of agitated patients.\nA computer-assisted literature search of the National Library of Medicine was performed.

Determination of appropriate standards for placebo use is especially difficult in areas such as pain treatment and psychiatry, in which substantial placebo responses can occur. Debates are characterized by three common themes: (a) whether the state of existing treatments forbids placebo use, (b) whether the nature of the condition being treated and the level of additional risk permit placebo control use, and (c) whether methodological concerns are sufficient to justify placebo use. A review of these themes in the psychiatric research literature suggests possible strategies for analysis of this issue in the area of pain research."}, {"Title": "Treatment issues in psychogenic-neuropsychiatric movement disorders.", "Abstract": "Patients with PNMDs pose a fascinating challenge to clinicians at the neurology-psychiatry interface. We have outlined a diagnostic and therapeutic approach to these complex disorders. Patients with PNMDs typically manifest abnormal movements and postures that do not fit expected patterns of movement disorder phenomenology. The first goal of neurologic consultation is to make an accurate diagnosis, with a view to either ruling out or defining the extent of any organic substrate. The next task is an effective referral to a psychiatrist capable of diagnosing relevant psychopathology and collaborating in a treatment plan. A supportive explanation of the diagnosis, one that is sensitive to the patient's intellectual capacity, conception of the illness, and self-esteem, appears to be a crucial determinant that influences the patient's capacity to be engaged effectively in treatment. The treatment for each patient with PNMD is individualized and may include psychotherapy, hypnosis, pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, and other approaches. To date, no treatment approach has been shown to be superior, and very few long-term outcome data are available. Although many factors influence response to treatment, those of particular importance are the effectiveness of communication among the neurologist, the psychiatrist, and the patient; the nature, severity, and chronicity of relevant psychopathology and environmental stressors; and the quality of external support and intrinsic resources available to the patient."}, {"Title": "Child murder committed by severely mentally III mothers: an examination of mothers found not guilty by reason of insanity. 2005 Honorable Mention/Richard Rosner Award for the best paper by a fellow in forensic psychiatry or forensic psychology.", "Abstract": "Forensic hospital records of 39 severely mentally ill mothers adjudicated Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity for filicide (child murder by parents) were analyzed to describe characteristics preceding this tragedy and to suggest prevention strategies.

Over two thirds (69%) of the mothers were experiencing auditory hallucinations, most frequently command hallucinations, and half (49%) were depressed at the time of the offense. Over one third (38%) of the filicides occurred during pregnancy or the postpartum period, and many had a history of postpartum psychosis. Almost three-quarters (72%) of the mothers had experienced considerable developmental stressors, such as death of their own mother or incest. Maternal motives for filicide were predominantly \"altruistic\" (meaning murder out of love) or \"acutely psychotic\" (occurring in the throes of psychosis, without rational motive).

Suicide is very rare in children with gradual increase towards adolescents. Suicide in children has association with family history, psychiatric disorders of both children and parents, especially depression and addictive disorders, cognitive and emotional disturbance in children, demographic characteristics, family discord, family psychopathology and child abuse, accessibility of lethal suicide methods. Identification of risk factors as foci for intervention is important for suicide prevention. Although there are some programs for prevention, their theoretical bases have been hardly presented and their efficacy are not acceptable.

The author, in this paper, discusses several issues of the psychodynamic psychotherapy for chronic suicidal patients with severe personality disorders. With regard to psychotherapy for them, the author firstly points out the treatment difficulties that stem from the training system both of psychiatry and psychotherapy where students are not systemically trained with treatment of suicidal behavior. Secondly he discusses psychodynamic evaluation, therapeutic attitude, treatment setting, counter-transference, and grief work. In terms of psychodynamic evaluation, it is suggested that a therapist needs to recognize self-maintaining function, unconscious fantasy of re-union with great pleasure, internal object relations that lead to self-destructiveness, resentment toward self, capacity for loving good aspects of personality, specific sensitiveness to certain object loss, disorganization of self representation, and ego regression. With regard to, the attitude of, the therapist and the treatment setting, the author stresses that psychotherapy should be conducted in a highly structured treatment setting with the attitude of the therapist such as active intervention, honesty (openness), awareness of treatability, and conviction. Countertransferences frequently develop based on the feelings that the therapist experiences narcissistic injury with regard to his/her own ego ideal in the psychotherapy process, in which he/she develops the various defense mechanism against the increasing aggression of his/her own. A therapist needs to be aware of the patient's dependency, make frequent interpretations of patient's destructiveness, and make effective use of the consultation at the time when he/she places himself/herself at the impasse of treatment. Finally, the author emphasizes the grief work for both therapist and family in the case when the patient unfortunately has committed suicide and open communications among therapist, other staff involved and family members should be strongly recommended. These works not only help persons concerned to work through their mourning work, but also prevent the transmission of suicides over generations."}, {"Title": "Olanzapine overdose in children and adolescents: two case reports and a review of the literature.", "Abstract": "Although the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine is increasingly being used in child and adolescent psychiatry, reports of olanzapine overdose in this young population are scarce. We report on two cases of adolescents who attempted suicide with an overdose of olanzapine: (1) A 14-year-old female ingested 275 mg olanzapine, which produced the highest reported nonlethal serum level (1503 ng/mL) and caused somnolence, agitation (acutely), and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS; after 54 hours) but no major clinical complications. The serum olanzapine level dropped to 129 ng/mL within 48 hours; and (2) a 17-year-old male ingested 400 mg olanzapine, the highest reported nonlethal dose of olanzapine in adolescents, which produced respiratory suppression requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation; he recovered after 3 days. Based on clinical monitoring and postmortem data, the 2 patients survived the ingestion of high doses of olanzapine.

A systematic literature analysis].", "Abstract": "Scientists and politicians currently pin great hopes on preventive activities in order to increase the health of particular target populations and to reduce illness related costs. This also holds true for mental disorders, which often show a chronic course of disease. The aim of the present study is to analyse the importance of prevention in social-psychiatric research.\nIncluding 60 journals, listed in the Science Citation Index or the Social Science Citation Index for the psychosocial field, a systematic literature analysis was done for the year 2004.\nOnly 14 percent of social-psychiatric original research paid attention to prevention. 39 percent of the prevention related publications refer to primary prevention, further 39 percent to secondary prevention, 22 percent focused on tertiary prevention. Research activities concentrated on prevention of substance related disorders as well as early detection or rehabilitation of schizophrenia.\nSocial psychiatry has only partly responded to the growing importance of prevention in health care. Because many social-psychiatric questions are important for prevention research, social psychiatry should use their competences to facilitate prevention-studies. This holds particularly true for depressive disorders and dementia, which are conditions with high prevalence and substantial illness related costs."}, {"Title": "The origin of pharmacopsychology: Emil Kraepelin's experiments in Leipzig, Dorpat and Heidelberg (1882-1892).", "Abstract": "This historical review shows that the early history of cognitive psychopharmacology, originally labelled as \"pharmacopsychology\", is closely linked to developments in experimental psychology and academic psychiatry. At the beginning of his scientific career, the German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) joined Wilhelm Wundt's laboratory of experimental psychology at the University of Leipzig. Although Kraepelin was fired from his clinical position at the university's psychiatric hospital, he completed his habilitation, the German equivalent of Ph.D., and started a series of pharmacological investigations in healthy volunteers using common recreational drugs (alcohol, coffee, tea) or medicinal products (amyl nitrite, chloral hydrate, chloroform, ethyl ether, morphine, paraldehyde) together with innovative psychological tasks. This paper reviews Kraepelin's pharmacopsychological research and his methodological innovations, providing translations, for the first time, from original papers, his monograph On the Modulation of Simple Psychological Processes by Some Medicines and from other sources. Kraepelin's contributions to psychopharmacology and clinical neuropsychology were far ahead of his time and his conceptual achievements have been largely neglected by modern psychiatry and cognitive neuroscience."}, {"Title": "Combined linkage and association analyses of the 124-bp allele of marker D2S2944 with anxiety, depression, neuroticism and major depression.", "Abstract": "A central issue in psychiatric genetics is whether positive findings replicate.

Anorectic patients have a high sensitivity, over-evaluate the intensities of the odors but under-evaluate their pleasantness. Alcoholic/drug addicted patients showed impairments in identification.\nThis study does not identify inter-individual differences in olfactory perception.\nThe psychiatric diseases, here at hand although every one of them may be characterized by depressive components, show diverging impairments in olfactory perception. When variations in sensitivity are usually attributed to peripheral cues, impairments in emotional and cognitive aspects of olfaction are typically related to specific brain structures and processes which could be particularly involved in these diseases."}, {"Title": "Youth violence prevention in a problem-based clerkship curriculum.", "Abstract": "This article describes the development of a problem-based learning case focused on youth violence prevention.

It holds that the revolution in computer science and artificial intelligence has reached the point that all the sciences in general can now account for the complex relations of an irreducible plurality of unique observers engaged in describing the same event. Plurimonism seeks to describe the conscious and unconscious relations of the scientific observer during the act of observation of a given event while preserving the historical uniqueness and indivisible identity of each such observer. Using the framework of plurimonism, we mathematically formulate the problem of empathy. This self-reflective mathematical model entails four components of the empathic process involving two observers. They are: 1) the self; 2) the self's-other; 3) the other; and 4) the other's-self. It measures the degree of accuracy of the therapist-observer's empathy, as well as conscious and unconscious processes involved in the patient-observer's idealization and the therapist-observer's confidence in clinical psychotherapy. Ratings are obtained from both patient and therapist from four different points of view. The plural views of the patient's global assessment of functioning (GAF) are from: 1) the therapist's view (TGAF); 2) the patient's view (PGAF); 3) the therapist empathic view (TEGAF), which represents the therapist's estimate of PGAF; and 4) the patient's empathic estimate of the TGAF. The GAF scale is the standard dimensional 100-point-scale measure used in psychiatry for recording a patient's functioning. The patient's estimate of the therapist's degree of accuracy as well as the therapist's confidence in his or her empathic accuracy is also represented. Three formulae are presented that describe the degree of the therapist's empathic accuracy, the patient's over-idealization/under-idealization, and the therapist's over-confidence/under-confidence. The concept of empathy is here restricted to mean the degree to which one observer can take the point of view of another observer when both are observing the same thing."}, {"Title": "Motivational interviewing and clinical psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Our objectives were as follows: 1) to survey the literature on motivational interviewing (MI), \"a client-centered yet directive method for enhancing intrinsic motivation to change by exploring and resolving client ambivalence\" and a well-established method of brief intervention, especially in the field of addictions treatment; 2) to review hypothesis about its mode of action; and 3) to discuss its possible impact on clinical psychiatry, in particular, on teaching communication skills.\nLiterature reviews and metaanalyses of numerous clinical trials of MI for addictions treatment have already been published and are briefly summarised. So far, no literature survey exists for MI applied to psychiatric patients. This review is limited to a synthesis of the articles relevant to psychiatry and to comments based on our team's experiences with MI.\nThere is no evidence that MI achieves better results than our other established techniques for treating addictions; it may simply work faster. The explanation for the method's rapid effectiveness remains speculative. Outcomes concerning the application of MI to psychiatric patients, although preliminary, are promising. Methods of assessing the integrity of MI treatment are more developed than in most psychotherapies, which permits the learning progress of trainees to be measured.\nMI offers a complement to usual psychiatric procedures. It may be worthwhile to teach it, not only for addictions but also for other broad treatment issues, such as enhancing patients' medication compliance and professionals' communication skills.

We analyzed a total of twenty-four Brazilian advertisements that were for the same psychoactive drugs as advertised in American and/or British publications from the same period.\nWe observed that Brazilian advertisements omitted information on usage restrictions, such as contraindications, adverse reactions, interactions, warnings and precautions, and that such information was present in American and British advertisements.\nThe data suggest that disparities in the information given for the same drug still persist. The information depends on the country in which each drug is marketed. The legislation is insufficient for eradicating such disparities."}, {"Title": "[The physician, classical literature and the psychiatric patient].", "Abstract": "The physician and in particular the psychiatric resident is regularly confronted by the humanistic dimension of psychiatry. Impressions from classical literature can be seen as a special inspiration and an enriching factor for acquiring understanding. The literary classics represent the earliest \"documentation\" of the psychology and psychopathology of humankind. The unconscious, irrational and enigmatical aspect of human existence and its aberrations is a shared interest in literature, psychology and medicine. Fictional literature conveys contributions of relevance to the history of psychiatry, on mental institutions, doctors' attitudes, ethical dilemmas as well as descriptions and thoughts about mental states. The borderland between normality and insanity is often a subject of particular interest. Literary classics represent a \"transcending psychology\" in contrast to other prevailing scientific categories and delineations. The language of the author generally implies a challenging, non-theoretical alternative, springing from the individual and his or her unique destiny. The language is usually non-moralising, frequently with a surprising and wondering use of lucid images and allegories. Classical world literature is predominantly referred to: Goethe, Kleist and Turgenev as portrayers of personality disorders; Dostoyevsky, Shakespeare and Nerval on psychoses, and the Old Testament and Snorri Sturlasson on affective disorders."}, {"Title": "[The National Mental Health Plan in Chile: 10 years of experience].", "Abstract": "Dealing with mental health problems is undoubtedly an increasingly important public health responsibility around the world. In Chile, because of the changes in the epidemiological profile of the population, the lifetime prevalence of mental and behavioral disorders has reached 36%. In response, the Ministry of Health of Chile, through its Mental Health Unit, prepared the National Plan for Mental Health and Psychiatry. The Plan establishes objectives, strategies, and steps to improve the well-being and mental health of Chileans. This piece describes the model of care for mental health and psychiatry used in Chile's public health care system, analyzes the main difficulties encountered and the achievements made in the 10 years that the Plan has been in place, and makes recommendations for improving the Plan. Over the 10-year period, the new model for mental health and psychiatry has managed to make a place for itself in the public health care system. Indicators show that the beneficiaries of the public health care system in Chile now have greater access to mental health services than before the new model of community care was established, have broader health care coverage, and receive better quality services."}, {"Title": "An integrated program to train local health care providers to meet post-disaster mental health needs.", "Abstract": "This paper describes a post-disaster mental health training program developed by the International Section of the Department of Psychiatry at Dalhousie University (Halifax, Canada) and delivered in Grenada after Hurricane Ivan struck the country in September 2004. This train-the-trainer program used an integrated community health model to help local health care providers develop the necessary skills for the identification and evidenced-based treatment of mental disorders occurring after a natural disaster. The approach also provided for ongoing, sustainable mental health care delivered in the community setting, as advocated by the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization.

These rates are lower than the incidence rates reported for white British people, and significantly lower that the 6- to 18-fold higher risk ratio incidence reported for African Caribbeans living in Britain. A comparative diagnostic study carried out in the United Kingdom (UK) suggests that misdiagnosis plays a significant role in this difference. Relatively low incidence figures for affective disorders, anxiety states, suicide and attempted suicide have been reported for Jamaica, Trinidad, and Barbados.\nMost published epidemiological studies of Caribbean populations center on schizophrenia, because of the startling findings of a large increase in risk ratios for African Caribbean people living in England compared to the white native British people. The etiological evidence is shifting toward factors of racism and social alienation experienced by black people in the UK, and to misdiagnosis by white British psychiatrists. Studies of the role of colonial enslavement and social engineering raise the etiological possibility of a role for social and structural community organization in the genesis of schizophrenia. The Caribbean thus represents a rich crucible for research in the epidemiology and etiology of mental health disorders."}, {"Title": "Multiregional cell assemblies, temporal binding and the representation of conceptual knowledge in cortex: a modern theory by a \"classical\" neurologist, Carl Wernicke.", "Abstract": "A contemporary view of conceptual representation in the brain holds that conceptual knowledge is distributed throughout the cerebral cortex, localized to cortical regions involved in their initial processing, and functionally interconnected through synchronized associative processes that are mediated through \"convergence zones\". The primary goal of the present paper is to point out that Carl Wernicke proposed a theory of how concepts are acquired and represented in cortex which is strikingly similar to contemporary views. Wernicke sketched his ideas on this topic in his earliest writings on aphasia. But his theory is developed most fully in the Grundriss der Psychiatrie (Outlines of Psychiatry), published in 1900 and never translated into English. We describe Wernicke's views on the distributed nature of conceptual knowledge in the brain using select quotes from his early work, and by providing a translation of relevant sections of the Grundriss der Psychiatrie."}, {"Title": "Lee-Associator-a chaotic auto-associative network for progressive memory recalling.", "Abstract": "In the past few decades, neural networks have been extensively adopted in various applications ranging from simple synaptic memory coding to sophisticated pattern recognition problems such as scene analysis and robot vision. Moreover, current studies on neuroscience and physiology have reported that in a typical scene segmentation problem our major senses of perception (e.g. vision, olfaction, etc.) are highly chaotic and involved non-linear neural dynamics and oscillations. In this paper, the author proposes an innovative chaotic neural oscillator-namely the Lee-oscillator (Lee's Chaotic Neural Oscillator) to provide a chaotic neural coding and information processing scheme. To illustrate the capability of Lee-oscillators upon pattern association, a chaotic auto-associative network, namely Lee-Associator (Lee's Chaotic Auto-associator) is constructed. Different from classical auto-associators such as the celebrated Hopfield network, which provides time-independent and static pattern association scheme, the Lee-Associator provides a remarkable progressive memory association scheme (what the author called 'Progressive Memory Recalling Scheme, PMRS') during the chaotic memory association. This is exactly consistent with the latest research in psychiatry and perception psychology on dynamic memory recalling schemes, as well as the implications and analogues to human perception as illustrated by the remarkable Rubin-vase experiment on visual psychology."}, {"Title": "Looking for pyromania: characteristics of a consecutive sample of Finnish male criminals with histories of recidivist fire-setting between 1973 and 1993.", "Abstract": "As pyromania is a rare diagnosis with questionable validity, we aimed to describe a forensic psychiatric population of arson recidivists.\nThe medical records as well as the forensic psychiatric examination statements of 90 arson recidivists referred for pretrial psychiatric assessment in Helsinki University Hospital Department of Forensic Psychiatry between 1973 and 1993 were reviewed.\nThe most important diagnostic categories of arson recidivists were personality disorders, psychosis and mental retardation, often with comorbid alcoholism. In all, 68% of arsonists were under alcohol intoxication during the index crime. Psychotic as well as mentally retarded persons with repeated fire-setting behaviour were mostly \"pure arsonists\"--persons guilty only of arsons during their criminal careers. Arson recidivists with personality disorder, in contrast, often exhibited various types of criminal behaviour and arson appeared to be only one expression of a wide range of criminal activity. Comorbid alcoholism was apparently a more rarely observed phenomenon among pure arsonists than in \"nonpure arsonists\". We found only three subjects fulfilling the present diagnostic criteria for pyromania.\nUsing the criteria of the DSM-IV-TR, pyromania must be regarded as an extremely rare phenomenon.

Studies of people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia have revealed critical views of medical authority, particularly over the issue of enforced compliance with antipsychotic medication. Psychiatrists are known to place particular value on such medication. This qualitative study reports the views of 21 general adult psychiatrists working in UK about their experiences of consultations involving discussion of antipsychotic medication. Interviewees reported a general commitment to achieving concordant relationships with patients and described a number of strategies they used to promote this. In this respect, their self-perception differs from the picture of authoritarian practice painted by critics of psychiatry, and by some studies reporting patients' views. Interviewees also described obstacles to achieving concordance, including adverse judgements of patients' competence and honesty about their medication use. Explaining the adverse effects of medication was perceived to discourage some patients from accepting this treatment. Moments of strategic dishonesty were reported. Psychiatrists perceived that trust could be damaged by episodes of coercion, or by patients' perception of coercive powers. We conclude that a self-perception of patient-centredness may not preclude psychiatrists from fulfilling a social control function."}, {"Title": "Moral responsibility, consciousness and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This article discusses the connection between consciousness and responsibility.

However, the special nature of the art or science of forensic psychiatry makes it imperative that beneficence is not the only ethical principle that guides the 'good' forensic psychiatrist. Indeed, the commonest ethical dilemmas in forensic psychiatry arise from a conflict between two ethical principles: beneficence, or promotion of welfare, and respect for justice. These two paradigms dominate discussions about the moral role and ethical duties of forensic psychiatrists and, in effect, give rise to two different practices in forensic psychiatry, each of which can also be said to have acquired a national identity. We discuss these competing principles and offer some thoughts about what this means for the ethics and values of forensic psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Hurly-burly of psychiatric ethics.", "Abstract": "This is the introductory paper to the special issue on ethics in psychiatry. We introduce the other papers that follow and set them in a context. Inevitably, they represent only a thin slice of the work going on in psychiatric ethics. But they serve to show two unique features of this discipline. First, it has a tendency to dig deep and to make connections with other philosophical concepts. So, for example, in a number of ways the papers that follow touch on the nature of personhood. We examine this notion. Second, psychiatric ethics, because of its content and its embededness in the real world, tends to hit upon diverse and sometimes conflicting values. We introduce the idea of values-based medicine, which provides both a theoretical framework and a practical approach to the common dilemmas of psychiatric practice. The need to think deeply, but also clearly and coherently, combined with the need to engage with the hurly-burly of the world of patients, users and carers, suggests the reasons why psychiatric ethics offers a paradigm for practical ethics generally."}, {"Title": "Mental health in Egypt.", "Abstract": "The concepts and management of mental health in Egypt are presented from the Pharaonic era through the Islamic Renaissance until today. Papyri from the Pharaonic period show that Soma and Psyche were not differentiated and mental disorders were described as symptoms of the heart and uterus. Although theories of causation were of a mystical nature, mental disorders were treated on a somatic basis. In the Islamic era, mental patients were neither maltreated nor tortured as a consequence of the belief that they may be possessed by a good Moslem genie. In the 14th century mental disorders was one of the four departments in Cairo's Kalawoon Hospital, a precursor of the place of psychiatry in general hospitals that was accepted in Europe six centuries later. The mental health services in Egypt today are described, and transcultural studies carried out in Egypt of the prevalence and phenomenology of anxiety, schizophrenia, depression, suicide, conversion and obsessive compulsive disorders are reviewed.

We relate to the special complexity of mental disorders with regards to etiology and pathophysiological diagnosis as well as to the strength and limitations of the 'pharmacological bridge' approach governing studies to unravel the etiology of mental disorders. There are presently no established and reliable, sensitive and specific objective biological diagnostic markers in psychiatry that can serve as 'gold standards'.

The time the nurses spend with psychiatric clients may mirror their attitudes towards and feelings for these clients. The aim of this study was to investigate the connections between the time spent together and the nurses' opinion of client behaviour and social functioning in community-based psychiatry. In this quantitative study, 29 clients were assessed by 30 nurses, who answered the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). At the same time, 11,200 non-participant observations of clients were registered using the Patient Activity Classification (PAC) to investigate how they spent their time at two psychiatric group dwellings. The PAC instrument revealed that clients spent an average of 60.8% of time alone, while only 20% of their daily time was spent with the nurses. Based on a factor analysis, indices were made by setting cut-off points for the PANSS and the GAF scores, and four small groups of clients were generated: a relatively high level of social functioning and a low degree of psychiatric symptoms (A); a relatively high level of social functioning and a high degree of psychiatric symptoms (B); a low level of social functioning and a low degree of psychiatric symptoms (C); and, finally, a low level of social functioning and a high degree of psychiatric symptoms (D). The clients judged as having a low level of social functioning in combination with high degrees of psychiatric symptoms, that is, the most vulnerable and dependent individuals, receive less staff attention (18%) and are the clients who spend the most time alone (71.4%).

Non-participant observation of verbal and non-verbal interaction between patients and nurses during conflict situations was undertaken on one PICU. The critical incidents observed were identified, categorized and systematically recorded. Nurses used a variety of low level physical and interactional manoeuvres in order to manage patients' disturbed and resistive behaviour. These manoeuvres were seldom recorded, discussed or reviewed, although they were frequently used to manage critical conflict situations.

Implications for psychiatric nosology.", "Abstract": "It has been conventional for psychiatric research, including the search for predisposing genes, to proceed under the assumption that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are separate disease entities with different underlying etiologies. These represent Emil Kraepelin's traditional dichotomous classification of the so-called \"functional\" psychoses and form the basis of modern diagnostic practice. However, findings emerging from many fields of psychiatric research do not fit well with this model. In particular, the pattern of findings emerging from genetic studies shows increasing evidence for an overlap in genetic susceptibility across the traditional classification categories-including association findings at DAOA(G72), DTNBP1 (dysbindin), COMT, BDNF, DISC1, and NRG1. The emerging evidence suggests the possibility of relatively specific relationships between genotype and psychopathology. For example, DISC1 and NRG1 may confer susceptibility to a form of illness with mixed features of schizophrenia and mania. The elucidation of genotype-phenotype relationships is at an early stage, but current findings highlight the need to consider alternative approaches to classification and conceptualization for psychiatric research rather than continuing to rely heavily on the traditional Kraepelinian dichotomy. As psychosis susceptibility genes are identified and characterized over the next few years, this will have a major impact on our understanding of disease pathophysiology and will lead to changes in classification and the clinical practice of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Looking forward in geriatric anxiety and depression: implications of basic science for the future.", "Abstract": "Major depression and anxiety are common psychiatric illnesses whose etiology remains incompletely understood. This review highlights progress in understanding the etiology of these illnesses through genetic strategies and looks forward to their impact on geriatric psychiatry. We briefly address three broad domains of progress, namely 1) genetic approaches to etiology, including linkage and association studies, pharmacogenetics (\"personalized medicine\"), and gene x environment interactions; 2) mechanisms of thyroid and testosterone action via nuclear receptors, given these hormones' status as possible augmenters of antidepressants; and 3) the role of the neuroimmune system as a contributor to the stress response. Genetic strategies offer one path for converting correlational findings into causal pathways while complementing studies of a gene's function at the molecular, cellular, network, and whole-organismal levels. Neuroendocrine supplementation (thyroid and testosterone) has a long history and tradition. A molecular understanding of nuclear receptor pathways and their coactivators, the mediator complex proteins, provides a rationale for improved targeting of hormonal action in a tissue-selective manner, yielding drugs with improved safety and efficacy. Neural-immune interactions in psychiatric illness remain tantalizing topics. Research suggests that cytokine pathways may contribute to the maintenance or susceptibility to stress, anxiety, and depressive disorders.

Their presenting complaints usually involved combinations of aggressive, hyperactive, and oppositional behaviour. Diagnoses included ADHD, a speech and language disorder, and an axis II disorder. Interventions were frequently unsuccessful because of parents' difficulties with attending appointments, and because of instability in the families' living arrangements.\nThese children, due to a complex interplay of biological and psychosocial adversity, are at serious risk of ongoing psychiatric disorders in childhood and adolescence, and for adverse outcomes in adult life.

Their treatment requires an interdisciplinary team. The aim of this paper is to discuss in patient treatment (n=80) of patients with eating disorders during eight years. This treatment was in charge of the Eating Disorders Team of the Hospital Italiano of Buenos Aires. The approach to critical stages of eating disorders envolves the clinical or psychiatric admission of the patients as the principal means to ward off patients from death or the appearance of cronifications. 77,5% of the patients were admitted to the psychiatric ward, 5% to a clinical ward and 17,5% to a clinical followed by a psychiatric ward. The average B.M.I. in admission was 16,83. The average time in psychiatry was 35 days. During inpatient treatment 21,25% required a nasogastric tube and 82% received psychopharmacological treatment. The mortality rate was 1,25%. During the ambulatory treatment that followed hospitalizations, 32,5% were readmitted to the psychiatric ward and there were 10% of dropouts. Hospitalization of these patients looks after the achievement of healthier eating habits and the establishment of a therapeutic alliance which allows the follow up of an ambulatory treatment."}, {"Title": "[Continuation ECT].", "Abstract": "A renaissance of electroconvulsive therapy in psychiatry can be observed in Germany. Here, ECT was named as a first line therapy for treating psychotic depression, depressive stupor, schizoaffective psychoses with severe depressive symptoms. Suprisingly, ECT is most commonly not used as a continuation therapy after achieving acute remission. With rare exceptions, antidepressive medication is chosen for this purpose. The use of continuation ECT (cECT) and subsequent maintenance ECT (mECT) is not (or just marginally) mentioned in practice guidelines. In our case report we report a successful cECT and mECT of a geriatric patient with severe comorbidity. This case is exemplified with respect to recent guidelines and study results. Particularly suggestions for interval duration, total duration of treatment, effects on cognition and memory, comorbidity and comedication, and reflections on quality of life and costs were discussed. We would therefore recommend a broader use of this proven treatment tool for keeping major depressions in remission."}, {"Title": "[Is there currently a boom of stigma research in psychiatry?].", "Abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing awareness among psychiatrists of the stigma of mental illness.

The sample consisted of 122 adults ages 20-60 who carried a diagnosis of major depression, dysthymia, or bipolar II disorder, voluntarily treated in the private sector. Chi-square was the measure used to assess differences in adherence. Adherence was determined by documentation from chart reviews, retrospectively, of the prescriptions for psychotropic medication for a period of up to nine months for each patient included in the research. Six psychiatrists and six APRNs volunteered to collect data from their private practices. Findings demonstrated no statistically significant differences in patient's adherence to medication if they were in split or integrated treatment or if either psychiatrists or an APRN treated them.

Previously, we demonstrated that approximately 60% loss of TH-IR axons in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) decreases local basal and stress-evoked extracellular dopamine (DA) concentrations, suggesting that moderate loss of DA axons in the mPFC is sufficient to alter the neurochemical activity of the remaining DA neurons (Neuroscience 93:497-505, 1999).\nTo further assess the functional consequences of partial mPFC DA depletion, we examined the effects of 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the rat mPFC on behavior in a T-maze delayed-response task. We also assessed whether chronic administration of the norepinephrine (NE) uptake inhibitor, desipramine (DMI), attenuates lesion-induced deficits in T-maze performance. Previous research indicates that inhibition of NE transport in the mPFC results in a concomitant increase in extracellular DA and NE.\nModerate loss of mPFC DA and NE (approximately 50 and 10% loss, respectively) was sufficient to impair delayed-response behavior, in part due to an increase in perseverative responding. Chronic DMI treatment (3 mg/kg delivered via osmotic pumps) impaired performance of control rats but attenuated the deficits in delayed-response behavior in rats previously sustaining loss of mPFC DA and NE (approximately 75 and 35% loss, respectively).\nThese data suggest that moderate loss of DA and NE in the prefrontal cortex is sufficient to impair cognitive function, and these behavioral effects are attenuated by inhibition of the NE transporter."}, {"Title": "[Ethics in clinical psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Although the significant influence of American bioethics on the Japanese medicine and medical education it does not mention however sufficiently on the psychiatric ethics, so we have to discuss once more what ethical issues stand in the area of clinical psychiatry.

Disregarding these special issues however, we will mention also the question what is fundamentally ethical in clinical psychiatry. This question relates very nearly with the opposition of materialism and spiritualism in the whole history of psychiatry, so we have to review how these oppositions such as body vs. soul, organic vs. psychogenic, biological vs. psychoanalytical, are treated in the history. As a result of the history it can be expressed that it may cause unethical occurrences if one extremely represents materialism or spiritualism, or reversely the holistic position of both of them to integrate and dissolve the contradiction of these alternative relations. Ethical is, rather, to stay in the middle or transitional area between materialism and spiritualism, and to retain this position always in our fundamental clinical attitude, even if it is very hard and stressful, for it demands to be tolerant of severe ambiguity."}, {"Title": "Effects of clozapine plus lamotrigine on phencyclidine-induced hyperactivity.", "Abstract": "There is growing evidence from both uncontrolled and controlled clinical studies that lamotrigine (LTG) significantly augments clozapine (CLZ) in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia (RS) [Dursun, S.M., McIntosh, D., Milliken, H., 1999.

Therefore, the goal of this research is to explore the mechanism of action of this synergistic interaction between CLZ and LTG, utilizing a pharmacological animal model of schizophrenia by using phencyclidine (PCP). The effects of CLZ plus LTG were assessed by measuring PCP-induced hyper-locomotion and stereotyped behaviours in rats. Adult male rats (250-300 g) were pre-treated via intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection with vehicle or drug 30 min before a PCP (5 mg/kg) or saline challenge. The behaviours were recorded and analysed for a 90-min period using the Etho Vision-computer based system. PCP produced hyper-locomotion, which was maximal at 30 min. LTG (10 mg/kg) significantly increased hyperlocomotion induced with PCP. However, a combination treatment of CLZ (5 mg/kg) plus LTG (10 mg/kg) significantly blocked the potentiation of PCP-induced hyper-locomotion observed with LTG (10 mg/kg) alone. Furthermore, the PCP-induced locomotion in the combination CLZ plus LTG-treated rats was significantly decreased when compared to vehicle. Therefore, LTG at doses that do not induce ataxia enhanced PCP-induced hyper-locomotion in rats, whereas the combination of LTG and CLZ significantly decreased PCP-induced hyper-locomotion consistent with clinical data."}, {"Title": "Shoplifting in the mentally ill: the role of bipolar affective disorder and mental retardation.", "Abstract": "This study explores shoplifting behaviour in mentally ill patients, and evaluates the association between shoplifting and different mental illnesses in a local Chinese population.

Atropine coma therapy (ACT) was one variety of nonconvulsive coma therapy used from the 1950s in a few state mental hospitals in the United States and in several Middle- and Eastern European countries until the late 1970s. In ACT, a coma of 6-10 hours' duration was induced with doses of parenteral atropine sulfate that were hundreds of times greater than the therapeutic dose administered in internal medicine. Although ACT was given to thousands of patients with a variety of diagnoses for nearly 3 decades, it is rarely mentioned, even in papers on the history of psychiatry. The method, indications, contraindications and adverse effects of ACT are summarized together with patients' personal accounts. Hypotheses concerning its mode of action are briefly mentioned.

Neuropsychological testing showed that although HM had extensive anterograde memory loss he could still acquire motor and cognitive skills implicitly, but could not remember the context of this learning. This has lead to declarative and procedural descriptions of the memory process. Cholinergic and monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems have also been implicated in the memory process and anticholinergic drugs traditionally have been associated with impairment of declarative memory. The cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease is a classic example of an application of these neuropharmacological findings. In schizophrenia, preattentive deficits have been amply demonstrated by unconscious priming studies. Memory processes are also impaired in these patients. Dopamine, glutamate and even cholinergic dysfunction has been implicated in the clinical picture of schizophrenia. The present paper will attempt to bring together both the anatomical and pharmacological data from these disparate fields of research under a cohesive theory of cognition and memory. A hypothesis is presented for an inverse relationship between monoaminergic and cholinergic systems in the modulation of implicit (unconscious) and explicit (conscious) cognitive processes. It is postulated that muscarinic cholinergic receptors and monoaminergic systems facilitate unconscious and conscious processes, respectively, and they disfacilitate conscious and unconscious processes, respectively (the purported inverse relationship). In fact, the muscarinic and monoaminergic modulations of a neural network are proposed to be finely balanced such that, if, the activity of one receptor system is modified then this by necessity has effects on the other system. It takes into account receptor subtypes and their effects mediated through excitatory and inhibitory G-protein complexes. For example, m1/D2 and D1/m4 paired receptor subtypes, colocalized on separate neurons would have opposing functional effects. A theory is then presented that the critical underlying pathophysiology of schizophrenia involves a hypofunctional muscarinic cholinergic system, which induces abnormal facilitation of monoaminergic subsystems such as dopamine (e.g., a decrease in m1R function would potentiate D2R function). This extends the idea of an inverted U function for optimal monoaminergic concentrations. Not only would this impair unconscious preattentive processes, but according to the hypothesis, explicit cognition as well including memory deficits and would underlie the mechanism of psychosis. Contrary to current thinking a different view is also presented for the role of the hippocampus in the memory process. It is postulated that long-term explicit memory traces in the neocortex are laid down by phasic coactivation of forebrain projecting monoaminergic systems above some basal firing rate, such as the rostral serotonergic raphe, which projects diffusely to the cortex and according to a modified Hebbian principle. This is the proposed principal function of the hippocampal theta rhythm. The phasic activation of the cholinergic basal forebrain is mediated by projections from a separate cortical structure, possibly the lateral prefrontal cortex. Phasic muscarinic receptor activation is proposed to strengthen implicit memory traces (at a synaptic level) in the neocortex. Thus, the latter are spared by medial temporal surgery explaining the dissociation of explicit from implicit memory."}, {"Title": "Cross-sex hormone treatment does not change sex-sensitive cognitive performance in gender identity disorder patients.", "Abstract": "Cognitive performance in untreated early onset gender identity disorder (GID) patients might correspond to their born sex and not to their perceived gender. As a current mode of intervention, cross-sex hormone treatment causes considerable physical changes in GID patients. We asked, as has been suggested, whether this treatment skews cognitive performance towards that of the acquired sex. Somatically healthy male and female early onset GID patients were neuropsychologically tested before, 3 and 12 months after initiating cross-sex hormone treatment, whereas untreated healthy subjects without GID served as controls (C). Performance was assessed by testing six cognitive abilities (perception, arithmetic, rotation, visualization, logic, and verbalization), and controlled for age, education, born sex, endocrine differences and treatment by means of repeated measures analysis of variance. GID patients and controls showed an identical time-dependent improvement in cognitive performance. The slopes were essentially parallel for males and females. There was no significant three-way interaction of born sex by group by time for the six investigated cognitive abilities. Only education and age significantly influenced this improvement. Despite the substantial somatic cross-sex changes in GID patients, no differential effect on cognition over time was found between C and GID participants. The cognitive performance of cross-sex hormone-treated GID patients was virtually identical to that of the control group.

Cognitive loss involves not only memory, but also motor function. The decrease of catecholaminergic and excitatory neurotransmissions, as well as of protein phosphorylation, have currently been identified as prominent biological markers of the above-mentioned diseases. Such deleterious biological events are well known to occur downstream of a progressive decline of intracellular Ca2+ signalling. This latter constitutes a key target for the neuronal plasticity that has also been reported during aging and psychiatric disorders. Most of the medicines used in psychiatry are active on the sigma-1 receptor. This membrane bound receptor is widely distributed in memory-associated cortical and motor-related brainstem areas, prompting the hypothesis that it might contribute to the pathophysiology of these behavioural brain diseases. The sigma-1 receptor is characterized by a unique mode of action by regulating both Ca2+ entry at the plasma membrane level (i.e. via potassium channels, voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels) and Ca2+ mobilization from endoplasmic stores [i.e. via Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors]. This review presents recent data supporting the notion that drugs acting via the endoplasmic reticulum-coupled sigma-1 receptor might reverse these deleterious events by restoring both extra- and intra-cellular Ca(2+)-dependent neuronal responses."}, {"Title": "Modeling depression: social dominance-submission gene expression patterns in rat neocortex.", "Abstract": "Gene expression profiles in the cortex of adult Long-Evans rats as a function of a stressful social loss and victory in inter-male fighting encounters were examined. This social dominance and subordination model has been postulated to simulate early changes in the onset of depression in the losers. Microarrays were fabricated containing 45mer oligonucleotides spotted in quadruplicate and representing 1178 brain-associated genes. Dynamic range, discrimination power, accuracy and reproducibility were determined with standard mRNA \"spiking\" studies. Gene expression profiles in dominant and subordinate animals were compared using a \"universal\" reference design [Churchill GA (2002) Fundamentals of experimental design for cDNA microarrays.

Genome Biol 4(4):R28]. And finally, genes of special interest were further studied using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Twenty-two transcripts were statistically significantly differentially expressed in the neocortex between dominant and subordinate animals.

The most robust of these were the increased expression of interleukin-18, heat shock protein 27, beta3-tubulin, ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 in subordinate animals. Interleukin-18 has been found to be over-expressed in human depression and panic disorder as well as other physiological stress paradigms [Takeuchi M, Okura T, Mori T, Akita K, Ohta T, Ikeda M, Ikegami H, Kurimoto M (1999) Intracellular production of interleukin-18 in human epithelial-like cell lines is enhanced by hyperosmotic stress in vitro.

Far from being a purely natural phenomenon, burn out should not be perceived as such, but rather it should be viewed in terms of how it relates to the ambiguity between the various professional sub-cultures of the different partners involved in the domain of care provision. In fact, burn out is socially constructed. It is not interpreted in the same way across all contexts, and varies for example when nurses speak about their personal challenges and difficulties associated with administering and performing their professional duties, or when their union representatives speak on their behalf to claim rights or create better conditions in their working environment, or when psychological researchers use the term. It is important to note that these different contexts influence how the term is construed, and scientific standardisation of such a term irrespective of the context in which it is used can lead to great misunderstanding.

It never served the majority of the non-chronically mentally ill with disordered social skills who also need specific support or are as well bound for unemployment and social disadvantages. Without doubt, the progress made by community psychiatry in the past was eminently linked to the ideology and implementation of deinstitutionalization. Defining and dealing with social exclusion means a turning point for social and community psychiatry - a new paradigm that could generate a different view upon therapeutical outcomes and the way that therapy and rehabilitation have to be organised and implemented. Especially the example of vocational rehabilitation could mark a stepping stone by initiating further investigations and progress for new approaches in community support. Supported employment programmes have shown the superiority of \"place and train\" instead of first train in institutions or services and then place on the spot. Thus a so-called inclusion therapy could arise that takes place \"in vivo et actu\" and near to the individual's real world of tasks and demands. Progress in any part of multidimensional therapy is legitimized only by empirical validation of functional outcome and social inclusion measures. Such an evaluation of complex programmes taking social inclusion into account is sophisticated but seems to be necessary in the field of general psychiatric therapies as well as for the legitimation of financial resources needed. Foreseeing the perspective of social psychiatry a next substantial step could be the identification of social and functional outcome variables."}, {"Title": "A 6-month prospective observational study on the effects of quetiapine on sexual functioning.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the long-term impact of quetiapine on sexual functioning of patients with schizophrenia treated in a real practice setting.\nThis was a multicenter, noncomparative, open-label, and naturalistic study conducted in outpatients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Patients were evaluated at baseline, day 15, and at the end of months 1, 3, and 6 using the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impression Severity and Improvement Scales, and the Psychotropic-Related Sexual Dysfunction Questionnaire. All primary effectiveness analyses were based on the intent-to-treat sample and consisted primarily of last-observation-carried-forward analysis of Psychotropic-Related Sexual Dysfunction Questionnaire, Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale, and Clinical Global Impression Improvement of Illness Scale.\nEighty-six patients were recruited by 19 investigators, and 82 patients were included in the intent-to-treat sample. Psychotropic-Related Sexual Dysfunction Questionnaire total scores for the patients decreased progressively and significantly from baseline to the study end point. When only patients who initiated quetiapine treatment without being switched from another antipsychotic (n = 28) were included in the intent-to-treat analysis, Psychotropic-Related Sexual Dysfunction Questionnaire scores remained almost unchanged throughout the study. Sexual dysfunction rates, defined as a change in the score of any item greater than 0, were 3.7%, 2.4%, 2.4%, and 4.9% for decreased libido, delayed ejaculation/orgasm, lack of ejaculation/orgasm, and difficulties with erection/lubrication, respectively. Overall, quetiapine was efficacious and well tolerated.\nDespite the limitations of the design, our results suggest that quetiapine shows a low frequency of sexual dysfunction during long-term treatment of patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder in the clinical practice setting."}, {"Title": "Delusions or obsessions: the same only different? A case report.", "Abstract": "The phenomenological distinction between delusions and obsessions has been the subject of much debate in psychiatry. Some authors feel these symptoms are distinct nosological entities, while others argue that they reflect manifestations of the same symptom and are distinguishable on the basis of the level of insight a patient displays. In this report we describe the case history of a lady who presented with an obsessional disorder. The symptom was resistant to standard treatments and subsequently became more delusional in nature. We review the literature in terms of the classification of obsessions and delusions and offer assistance to clinicians in terms of the diagnosis and treatment of cases where the distinction between these phenomena is not clear and offer alternative means of classifying these symptoms based on insight."}, {"Title": "[A documentation form for the consultation-liaison service: development of the CL-BaDo].", "Abstract": "In consultation liaison (CL) psychiatry and psychosomatics a multicenter documentation form for the assessment of clinical characteristics of patients and CL service delivery is urgently needed for health care planning and future mental health research.\nIn several steps a joint working party of the psychosomatic and psycho-therapeutic societies in Germany (German College for Psychosomatic Medicine, German Society of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, General Medical Society for Psychotherapy) developed a documentation form for C-L service (CL-BaDo).

Our objectives were to characterize inpatients who fall and to determine predictors of serious fall-related injury.\nWe performed a retrospective observational study of 1,082 patients who fell (1,235 falls) during January 2001 to June 2002 at an urban academic hospital. Multivariate analysis of potential risk factors for serious fall-related injury (vs no or minor injury) included in the hospital's adverse event reporting database was conducted with logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI95)\nThe median age of patients who fell was 62 years (interquartile range, 49-77 years), 50% were women, and 20% were confused. The hospital fall rate was 3.1 falls per 1,000 patient-days, which varied by service from 0.86 (women and infants) to 6.36 (oncology). Some (6.1%) of the falls resulted in serious injury, ranging by service from 3.1% (women and infants) to 10.9% (psychiatry). The most common serious fall-related injuries were bleeding or laceration (53.6%), fracture or dislocation (15.9%), and hematoma or contusion (13%). Patients 75 years or older (aOR, 3.2; CI95, 1.3-8.1) and those on the geriatric psychiatry floor (aOR, 2.8; CI95, 1.3-6.0) were more likely to sustain serious fall-related injuries.\nThere is considerable variation in fall rates and fall-related injury percentages by service.

Identifying early predictors is thus important. Genetic and prenatal environmental risk factors and prefrontal cortical function are thought to contribute. Recent evidence suggests that prefrontal cortical function is influenced by a valine/methionine variant in the catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene.\nTo test the a priori hypothesis that this genetic variant predicts early-onset antisocial behavior in a high-risk sample and further examine the effects of birth weight, an environmentally influenced index of prenatal adversity previously linked to childhood disruptive behaviors and genotype x birth weight interaction.\nA family-based genetic study was undertaken between 1997 and 2003. Participants were prospectively recruited from child and adolescent psychiatry and child health clinics in the United Kingdom and included 240 clinic children who met diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or hyperkinetic disorder. Participants underwent comprehensive standardized assessments including measures of antisocial behavior and IQ. Main Outcome Measure DSM-IV symptoms of childhood-onset conduct disorder rated by trained interviewers using a standard diagnostic interview.\nThe results show main effects of the COMT gene variant (P = .002), birth weight (P = .002), and a significant gene x environment (COMT x birth weight) interaction (P = .006).\nEarly-onset antisocial behavior in a high-risk clinical group is predicted by a specific COMT gene variant previously linked with prefrontal cortical function and birth weight, and those possessing the val/val genotype are more susceptible to the adverse effects of prenatal risk as indexed by lower birth weight."}, {"Title": "Interface between endocrinology and psychiatry in women with epilepsy: analysis of the relationship with comorbid pathology.", "Abstract": "This study was carried out to detect a possible association between endocrine pathology, neurological symptoms, and psychiatric variables in women with epilepsy.

The results obtained showed that catamenial epilepsy was observed mainly in women with reproductive dysfunction and normal thyroid function. There was a reciprocal relationship between thyroid and reproductive pathology.

The \"pseudoscientific\" methods used to screen for mental and behavioral abnormalities are a legacy from the discredited ideology of eugenics. Both eugenics and psychiatry suffer from a common philosophical fallacy that undermines the validity of their theories and prescriptions. Both are wed to a faith-based ideological assumption that mental and behavioral manifestations are biologically determined, and are, therefore, ameliorated by biological interventions. NFC promoted the Texas Medication Algorithm Project (TMAP) as a \"model\" medication treatment plan. The impact of TMAP is evident in the skyrocketing increase in psychotropic drug prescriptions for children and adults, and in the disproportionate expenditure for psychotropic drugs. The New Freedom Commission's screening for mental illness initiative is, therefore, but the first step toward prescribing drugs. The escalating expenditure for psychotropic drugs since TMAP leaves little doubt about who the beneficiaries of TMAP are. Screening for mental illness will increase their use."}, {"Title": "[Risk factors for delinquent behavior in schizophrenic patients -- a survey from Krafft-Ebing till today].", "Abstract": "The dangerousness of psychotic, especially schizophrenic patients has always been a matter for controversial discussion. On the one side psychiatrists got under suspicion to show too much understanding for deviant and aggressive acts of their patients and to forget the public need for security. On the other side experts disagreed in their opinion on the risk of aggressive behaviour. The following paper reviews the development in evaluation of risk factors from Krafft-Ebing to the presence. On this way the studies of B\u00f6ker are a milestone in forensic psychiatry. The doctrine \"schizophrenic = irresponsible = dangerous\" was not valid any more. He showed that the risk for violence depends on much more than the diagnosis of mental illness. Based on the outcome of his study and his differentiated descriptions of subtypes of schizophrenia and their individual risk of violence modern psychological prognostic instruments were developed."}, {"Title": "[Psychoanalytical aspects regarding etiology and understanding of schizophrenic psychoses].", "Abstract": "The author -- specialized in Psychiatry and Neurology as well as a Psychoanalyst -- reports her experience during some decades of treating patients with schizophrenia in greatly different hospitals and institutions. Many examples demonstrate that psychoanalytical knowledge and recognizing psychodynamic connections can essentially contribute to understanding and treating psychotic patients. From the multitude of psychoanalytic theories on the etiology of schizophrenia some aspects are demonstrated, mainly those regarding their use in practical work. Some of them are: ego-disturbance, the psychotic symptom as a defence mechanism and the problem of countertransference. Regarding the ego-disturbance some examples show that usually not all ego-functions are impaired. Thus, cognitive functions may not only frequently be preserved, but may be working even better than usual. Out of numerous mechanisms of defense in schizophrenia projection, identification, projective identification, splitting, denial and regression are especially important. Moreover, psychotic patients frequently show certain symptoms that are related to very personal experiences. They can often be recognized quite easily as defence mechanisms. Countertransference is of great importance when treating such patients. Three of these numerous phenomenous are mentioned especially: anxiety, compassion, which may lead to identification, and the incapacity to accept the limit of therapeutic measures. The author is convinced that the so-called \"psychodynamic\" and \"biological\" psychiatry are not in opposition. Splitting them is not justified because according to the different stages of illness treatment with drugs as well as with different psychotherapeutic methods, even with psychoanalytical ones and social rehabilitation, are necessary. The etiology of schizophrenic psychosis cannot be explained with psychoanalysis either. Yet, the knowledge of psychodynamic processes can contribute essentially to understanding the illness and treating the patient. The compliance accomplished thereby can improve the quality of life of the patient and possibly for the therapist too."}, {"Title": "[Etiopathogenetic theories in historical concepts of schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "In the years between 1800 and 1914, the real beginning of the twentieth century, different etiological theories and models were developed about illnesses which we today know as schizophrenic disorders. Particularly in the German speaking world, in the first third of the nineteenth century many of these followed a religious metaphysical paradigm. Those who paved the way for modern psychiatry represented an etiological concept with varying emphasis on brain pathological, hereditary-degenerative or psycho-dynamic as well as sociogenic perspectives. It has become apparent that psychiatry was always in danger of giving way to reductionist approaches. Every reductionism emphasises merely partial truths. The systemic perspective teaches us that many points of view do not contradict each other but rather compliment each other."}, {"Title": "Identification of distinct characteristics of postural sway in Parkinson's disease: a feature selection procedure based on principal component analysis.", "Abstract": "We selected descriptive measures of the centre of pressure (CoP) displacement in quiet standing, by means of a procedure based on principal component analysis, in two groups particularly different in terms of postural behaviours, such as subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) in the levodopa off and on states. We computed 14 measures of the CoP: 5 measures of CoP trajectory over the support surface, 3 measures that estimated the area covered by the CoP, 1 measure that estimated the principal CoP sway direction, 1 measure that quantified the CoP total power, 1 measure that estimated the variability of CoP frequency content and 3 measures of characteristic CoP frequencies [L.

Horak, Effects of deep brain stimulation and levodopa on postural sway in Parkinson's disease, J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry, 73 (2002) 267-274]. The feature selection, independently applied to the measures obtained in the two groups, resulted in different principal component (PC) subspaces of the 14-dimension original data set (4 PCs in the off and 3 PCs in the on state to account for over 90% of the original variance), but in the same 5 CoP measures (selected features) needed to describe the different postural behaviours: root mean square distance; mean velocity; principal sway direction; centroidal frequency of the power spectrum; frequency dispersion. The five selected features were found to provide insight into the postural control mechanisms and to describe changes in postural strategies in the two groups of PD subjects, off and on levodopa. Thus, the five selected features may be recommended for use in clinical practice and in research, in the direction toward the definition of a standard protocol in quantitative posturography."}, {"Title": "Politics of healing and politics of culture: ethnopsychiatry, identities and migration.", "Abstract": "Ethnopsychiatry is today a contested field, in which concepts and terms such as ethnicity, identity, culture, citizenship, traditional therapies or symbolic efficacy are used in a very controversial way. Recent accusations of'racism' against some ethnopsychiatrists have contributed to making more obscure the deep roots of these issues and controversies. Little attention has been paid to analysing the complex legacy of colonial psychiatry, as well as the relationships among current definitions of 'culture' and 'belonging', post-colonial subjectivities and migration. In this article, the authors briefly analyse the contributions of Italian ethnopsychiatry and investigate the hidden expressions of racism and prejudice still characterizing mental health workers' attitudes toward immigrants.

This ambiguity is traced down to the level of grant negotiations between doctors and 'clients' in a psychiatry clinic in Khayelitsha. Here 'having nerves' embodies the distress associated with harsh circumstances and is deemed by supplicants as sufficient to secure a grant. The paper illustrates how national discourses influence the presentation and experience of suffering and the way in which doctors mediate diagnoses.

In contrast to classic neurological illnesses that involve discrete brain lesions, mental disorders need to be addressed as disorders of distributed brain systems with symptoms forged by developmental and social experiences. While genomics will be important for revealing risk, and cellular neuroscience should provide targets for novel treatments for these disorders, it is most likely that the tools of systems neuroscience will yield the biomarkers needed to revolutionize psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. This essay considers the discoveries that will be necessary over the next two decades to translate the promise of modern neuroscience into strategies for prevention and cures of mental disorders.

So far, no literature survey exists for MI applied to psychiatric patients. This review is limited to a synthesis of the articles relevant to psychiatry and to comments based on our team's experiences with MI.\nThere is no evidence that MI achieves better results than other established techniques for treating addictions; it may simply work faster. The explanation for the method's rapid effectiveness remains speculative. Outcomes concerning the application of MI to psychiatric patients, although preliminary, are promising. Methods of assessing the integrity of MI treatment are more developed than in most psychotherapies, which permits the learning progress of trainees to be measured.\nMI offers a complement to usual psychiatric procedures.

An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to the mailboxes of 154 residents in the departments of psychiatry, internal medicine, and obstetrics and gynaecology at four hospitals affiliated with Brown University Medical School. Residents were asked to report whether they had encountered specific behaviours from supervisors during medical training, the frequency of these experiences, and the professional status of the supervisor involved in each episode. There was a significant reported incidence of behaviours related to academic/professional boundaries, personal boundaries, and dating boundaries. Some of these behaviours raise issues related to exploitation. The major sources of these reported boundary behaviours were hospital-based clinical faculty, university-based academic faculty, and senior house staff. The potentially adverse effects of boundary behaviours on the individual student, the teacher-student relationship, and the doctor-patient relationship are discussed.

OCD is often a chronic disorder that produces significant morbidity when not properly diagnosed and treated. The mainstay of treatment includes cognitive behavioral therapy and medication management. The use of clomipramine in the 1960s and then the introduction of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the 1980s represented important advances in the pharmacologic treatment of OCD. Despite effective treatment modalities, many patients demonstrate only a partial response or are resistant to available medications.

Aims To describe the disability burden of primary care patients with common mental disorders and subthreshold disorders and to examine the association between general practitioner's (GP) recognition of mental disorder and disability. Design Cross-sectional survey of GPs and their patients. Setting General practices in the lower North Island of New Zealand. Method Participants were randomly selected: GPs (n=70) and their patients (n=3414, of whom a subset of 775 from the basis of this paper). Formal DSM-IV diagnoses were made with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), and psychosomatic and psychological symptoms were measured with the Somatic and Psychological Health Report. Disability was measured with the World Health Organisation's Disability Assessment Schedule-version II. GPs independently rated the severity of psychological symptoms and the presence or absence of disorder. Results The principal findings were (1) that disability was associated with both mental disorder and subthreshold disorder with no significant difference in the level of disability between these categories, and (2) that GPs were less sensitive to the presence of mental disorders as defined by the CIDI if there was little concomitant disability, and in subthreshold cases, the presence of disability increased the chance of GPs identifying clinically significant symptoms. Conclusion Studies of GP recognition of mental disorder have almost exclusively adopted the perspective of concepts of disorder as defined by psychiatry. This study provides some insight into the way GPs attend to both symptoms and functioning in their assessments of psychological syndromes. Disability is an important cue to recognition of mental health problems in the primary care setting, including those that are not recognised by standardised psychiatric assessment but which may still be relevant to patient suffering."}, {"Title": "The validity and 4-year test-retest reliability of the Brazilian version of the Eating Attitudes Test-26.", "Abstract": "In a cross-sectional study conducted four years ago to assess the validity of the Brazilian version of the Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26) for the identification of abnormal eating behaviors in a population of young females in Southern Brazil, 56 women presented abnormal eating behavior as indicated by the EAT-26 and the Edinburgh Bulimic Investigation Test. They were each matched for age and neighborhood to two normal controls (N = 112) and were re-assessed four years later with the two screening questionnaires plus the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). The EAT results were then compared to diagnoses originating from the CIDI. To evaluate the temporal stability of the two screening questionnaires, a test-retest design was applied to estimate kappa coefficients for individual items. Given the prevalence of eating disorders of 6.2%, the CIDI psychiatry interview was applied to 161 women. Of these, 0.6% exhibited anorexia nervosa and 5.6%, bulimia nervosa (10 positive cases). The validity coefficients of the EAT were: 40% sensitivity, 84% specificity, and 14% positive predictive value. Cronbach's coefficient was 0.75. For each EAT item, the kappa index was not higher than 0.344 and the correlation coefficient was lower than 0.488. We conclude that the EAT-26 exhibited low validity coefficients for sensitivity and positive predictive value, and showed a poor temporal stability. It is reasonable to assume that these results were not influenced by the low prevalence of eating disorders in the community. Thus, the results cast doubts on the ability of the EAT-26 test to identify cases of abnormal eating behaviors in this population."}, {"Title": "Identification and treatment of patients with nicotine problems in routine clinical psychiatry practice.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to assess the rates of nicotine problems diagnosed by psychiatrists, the characteristics of psychiatric patients who smoke, and the services provided to them in routine psychiatric practice. Data were obtained by asking psychiatrists participating in the American Psychiatric Institute for Psychiatric Research and Education's Practice Research Network to complete a self-administered questionnaire to provide detailed sociodemographic, clinical, and health plan information on three of their patients seen during routine clinical practice. A total of 615 psychiatrists provided information on 1,843 patients, of which 280 (16.6%) were reported to have a current nicotine problem. Of these, 9.1% were reported to receive treatment for nicotine dependence. Patients with nicotine problems were significantly more likely to be males, divorced or separated, disabled, and uninsured, and have fewer years of education. They also had significantly more co-morbid psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia or alcohol/substance use disorders; a lower Global Assessment Functioning score; and poorer treatment compliance than their counterparts. The results suggest a very low rate of identification and treatment of nicotine problems among patients treated by psychiatrists, even though psychiatric patients who smoke seem to have more clinical and psychosocial stressors and more severe psychiatric problems than those who do not smoke. Programs should be developed to raise the awareness and ability of psychiatrists to diagnose and treat patients with nicotine problems, with a particular emphasis on the increased medical and psychosocial needs of psychiatric patients who smoke."}, {"Title": "Psychometric properties of the social phobia inventory: further evaluation.", "Abstract": "This study investigated the psychometric properties of the Social Phobia Inventory [SPIN; Connor, K.

The discovery of neurosteroids followed the revelation that the brain exhibited the capacity to synthesize its own steroids in situ and thus be a potential site of steroidogenesis. In contrast to some steroids that exhibit traditional genomic steroid actions, most neurosteroids appear to regulate neuronal function by means of \"non-genomic\" mechanisms influencing neuronal excitability. Neurosteroids are synthesized either from CNS cholesterol or from peripheral steroid precursors and exhibit a wide range of modulatory effects on neurotransmitter receptor activity, most notably at the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptor. Neurosteroids play an important role in neurodevelopment and neuroprotective effects, many aspects of which may have particular applicability to psychiatric disorders including various gender differences. Neurosteroids appear to be relevant to the pathophysiology and pharmacological treatment of many psychiatric disorders including the most notable mood and anxiety disorders, but also psychotic, childhood, eating, dementia, stress and postpartum disorders. It has been suggested that neurosteroids may become potential targets for pharmacological intervention in the future with further neurosteroid investigation contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior and psychopathology."}, {"Title": "[Responsibilities of the Public Health Service in psychiatric care].", "Abstract": "Almost unnoticed by the general public, but also to some extent by public health professionals, psychiatric care in Germany has recently undergone considerable change. This development could be considered as more revolutionary than changes seen in somatic medicine. These changes can also be found in progress in \"psychiatry as a science\"in areas as diverse as prevention, diagnosis and treatment of those with mental illness, and their rehabilitation, recovery and after-care. Public health professionals have long witnessed these changes which have fluctuated in intention and intensity.

Thus, we aimed at quantifying the amount of additional efforts during the two weeks before hospitalisation of acute exacerbating psychosis compared to the time before.\nBy means of the semi-structured 'Interview for Measuring the Burden on the Family' we interviewed relatives of people with schizophrenia. To quantify additional burden we asked how much time a person who would take over the additional burden has to afford. Subscales of different sources of burden and total scales were correlated.\nAn additional 8.9 hours per day would have to be spent in favour of the patient, which results in additional costs of Euro 3,115-Euro 4,984 (ca. pounds 2,100-3,400) for two weeks. The main sources of additional burden are quantity, quality and nature of contacts to the affected. This includes the frequency of contact to the affected, the whereabouts and symptoms of the affected, as well as the social contacts of the relatives.\nOur results clarify the quantitative aspect of care provided by relatives of people with schizophrenia. Apart from the practical and emotional help to relatives the development of a diversified network of community psychiatry services, e.g. day and night hospitals, as well as crisis accommodations should be established."}, {"Title": "The troubled relationship between psychiatry and sociology.", "Abstract": "The alienated relationship between psychiatry and sociology is explored. The two disciplines largely took divergent paths after 1970. On the one side, psychiatry manifested a pre-occupation with methodological questions and sought greater medical respectability, with a biomedical approach returning to the fore. Social psychiatry and its underpinning biopsychosocial model became increasingly marginalised and weakened. On the other side, many sociologists turned away from psychiatry and the epidemiological study of mental health problems and increasingly restricted their interest to social theory and qualitative research. An interdisciplinary void ensued, to the detriment of the investigation of social aspects of mental health."}, {"Title": "Does having an occupational mental health service make any difference?", "Abstract": "The effects of mental disorder on UK's workforce are increasing, yet most occupational health (OH) providers have limited expertise in dealing with mental health issues.\nTo examine the effectiveness in terms of organizational and clinical outcomes, of an OH liaison psychiatry service in an inner city area.\nA retrospective survey of case notes from the first 2 years of an OH liaison psychiatry service was carried out.\nSeventy-six cases were identified and 68% were seen within 1 month of referral. After assessment, females were significantly more likely to be given a formal psychiatric diagnosis than males. Overall, 45% of patients had mood disorders, 14% anxiety disorders and two cases of psychosis were identified. Advice was offered to the referring OH practitioner in 80% of cases.\nThis study found that liaison psychiatrists were able to fulfil a useful role in an OH department. Most of the cases seen within the department would not be classed as serious mental illness and therefore it is unlikely that community mental health teams would become involved in their routine care. Specialist mental health support from an 'in house' service is likely to be of considerable benefit from both occupational and medical perspectives."}, {"Title": "[Clinical nutritional outcome in patients recovering in a psychiatric setting from severe protein-energy malnutrition of anorexia nervosa].", "Abstract": "Protein energy malnutrition due to anorexia nervosa, either restrictive or bulimic, requires an integrated medical psychiatric intervention to be treated.

Fifteen patients (14 females, 1 male, mean age 19.6 +/- 4.7 years, body mass index 14.0 +/- 1.9 kg/m2) 13 of whom affected by restrictive anorexia nervosa and 2 by bulimic anorexia nervosa, have been hospitalized in the Psychiatry Unit of the Federico II University Hospital, Naples from September 2000 to July 2003, always without requiring compulsory sanitary treatment. Hospitalization was due to failure of the outpatient treatment in all of them, complicated by uncontrolled weight loss in 7, hydroelectrolytic unbalance in 2, edema in 1 patient. All were hypotensive and 4 had marked bradycardia. Forced nutrition was never necessary. Enteral nutrition by nasogastric tube was prescribed in 4 patients, oral nutrition supplements with diet in 4 and only diet in the remaining 7. All patients received vitamin and mineral supplements, if necessary parenterally. A mild body weight increase and satisfactory normalization of biochemical parameters was obtained in all patients during hospitalization.

There have been very important changes from asylums to mental hospitals and from voluntary or involuntary inpatient treatment to outpatient care; but clinical psychiatry cannot give up forensic psychiatry. As a result of developments, inpatient care in mental hospitals often concentrates on crisis management, risk assessment, and risk management.

In this metaphorical rendering, psychiatry has swung back and forth between extremes of emphasis on psyche (life events and inner conflict ruling etiological thinking, talk therapy dominating treatment) and soma (biochemical sources dominating etiological thinking, somatic treatments dominating treatment). This article argues that, while this metaphor is suited to capturing certain aspects of American psychiatric history, it distorts others by, for example, exaggerating the extent of dogmatism on either side and obscuring continuities in psychiatry's history. The article looks specifically at the reception by psychoanalysts to the introduction of electroconvulsive therapy.

Advanced training in rural settings to prepare physicians to better serve rural areas has received particular attention around the world. Such initiatives are usually targeted at primary care practitioners. Few initiatives have been designed to enhance specialist training in a rural setting, let alone adapt specialist competency frameworks such as the CanMEDS roles of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada to non-urban medical education.\nWe describe an innovation in medical training for rural competence for specialist physicians using the CanMEDS framework near London, Ontario, Canada. Since 1997, the University of Western Ontario has established its Multi-Specialty Community Training Network (MSCTN) to provide rural and regional training opportunities for specialty residents in anaesthesia, general surgery, internal medicine, paediatrics, obstetrics and psychiatry. It became the first program in Canada to fully adapt the new CanMEDS roles into learning objectives and evaluations.\nCompetency-based frameworks like CanMEDS are important because they provide a comprehensive tool to organize outcome-based curricula. The CanMEDS roles framework has been very useful in developing educational goals for rural/regional specialty resident rotations as well as forming a constructive basis for resident, preceptor, and program evaluations. Our experiences with this program may provide lessons for others planning training for specialists in rural settings, and those adopting the CanMEDS competency framework."}, {"Title": "The challenge of psychiatric comorbidity to the public services for drug dependence in Italy: A national survey.", "Abstract": "We evaluated the availability of resources and specific expertise for treating comorbidity at the Italian public Services for Drug Dependence (SerTs).

As most frequent disorders we found conduct disorders (CD), ADHD and depressive disorders. Highest levels of psychopharmalogical treatment were found in ADHD (25 to 33.3%), half of the children and adolescents with ICD-10 F diagnosis got psychiatric or psychotherapeutic treatment. Compared to the high prevalence of severe mental disorders in children and adolescents living in residential care the levels of psychopharmacological and psychiatric/psychotherapeutic treatment seem to be low, especially in those with conduct disorders (CD) and ADHD.

Maggots were selectively associated with the disgusting juice, pit bull terriers with the harm-related shock, and rabbits with nothing. Spiders were associated with both aversive UCSs, but significantly stronger in the high fear group.

The examination was conducted by means of the Suicidal Intent Scale (SIS)--a psychological test created by Aaron Beck. In the case of about 65% of the patients examined, their suicide attempts most frequently were acts of impulsive behaviour, rarely planned for longer than three hours before the realization and usually made in another person's presence or in a situation in which another person's intervention was highly probable. Such attempts had the character of \"a cry for help\", and were aimed at effecting some change or at manipulating the environment. Nevertheless, the patients acted in a conviction that their act was a serious attempt at ending life, and, most frequently, they maintained such opinions during the examination. On the other hand, they rarely expressed further suicidal intents, and more frequently accepted the fact that their lives had been saved. By contrast, the remaining 35% of the patients examined had attempted suicide with the evident intention to kill themselves; they had taken full precautions against being discovered and had planned suicide carefully to eliminate the smallest possibility of intervention. In the majority of cases, they still maintained the wish to die after the attempt. As the results of the examination indicate, the Suicidal Intent Scale, and, especially, the Precautions subscale, point at the important aspect of suicidal intentions, which, being of vital importance for the diagnostic purposes and suicide prevention, requires further investigation."}, {"Title": "Making the case for caregiver research in geriatric psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Research on caregiver health has seen a groundswell of interest in the last few years.

In psychiatric history this debate is often portrayed in a somewhat simplifying manner. Namely Oppenheim was considered as the leading exponent of the organic etiology of traumatic neurosis, while others, with growing interest in psychodynamic theories, were thought to favor exclusively psychogenesis of this condition. However, only discussing matters in this way would be too simple. Rather, the controversy was much more differentiated and led to important insights: First, it turned out to be impossible to explain any psychopathological syndrome exclusively in terms of neuropathological, i. e. structural alterations, in particular, a syndrome presenting with a sudden onset of dissociative and conversion symptoms. Secondly, the psychiatric theory of hysteria of Charcot and Freud was developed and extended further. And, last, the etiology of war neurosis was recognized to be multifactorial. Thus, the discourse on this issue was not one-dimensional and favoring a single explanation for a complex disorder, but revealed \"pluridimensional\" features. Subsequently psychotherapy, for the first time, was widely introduced into clinical practice with a clear indication and well-defined methodological approach. In summary, war neuroses can be addressed as an early model of traumatic stress disorder, such as acute stress disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder."}, {"Title": "Child and adolescent psychiatry in The Netherlands: patterns of practice 7 years later.", "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate capacity, demographic composition, and patterns of practice of Dutch child and adolescent psychiatrists, and to compare these findings with the results of a similar investigation in 1996.\nA postal survey was sent out to all Dutch child and adolescent psychiatrists.\nIn comparison with 1996, there is an increase in Dutch child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) capacity.

The burnout has been subject of analysis in all the departments, whom oncology and psychiatry result the ones with the highest frequency of studies. In this paper all the studies have been divided into three categories according to their objective: studies on aspects related to the burnout (57,5%), comparative studies (25%), studies on the burnout level (17,5%). From the studies concerning the related aspects comes out that the burnout is strongly related to the coping strategies, the stress index and the personal accomplishment and these factors are highly predictive. Beside that, the data show some disagreements concerning the relation between burnout and sex and burnout and age. The comparative studies show that nurses are, between health care staff, the ones which run the highest risk of burnout, especially the oncologic nurses and nurses working with AIDS patients. This literature review, summing up which steps the research has done and which are still to do, reflects the strong importance of the problem called burnout and the aspects related to it inside the world of nursing. This review underlines the importance of an insertion of support group inside the clinical practice to avoid the risk to have sick persons who take care of other patients."}, {"Title": "Clinical analyses of sighted patients with non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome: a study of 57 consecutively diagnosed cases.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to clarify the clinical features of sighted patients with non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome.\nClinical analyses of consecutive patients suffering from non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome.\nThe sleep disorders clinic at Kohnodai Hospital, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Japan.\nFifty-seven patients who were diagnosed consecutively as having non-24-hour sleep-wake syndrome between 1991 and 2001 were included in the study.\nThe clinical features and sleep characteristics of the patients were analyzed.

The authors show that cultural values are always imbedded in psychiatric practice and that their role in that practice depends on the patients, treatments, and therapeutic rationales present in a given therapeutic encounter. Because the decade following World War II witnessed dramatic changes in psychiatry's patients, therapeutics, and rationales, Stockton State Hospital's patient records from this time period allow the authors to show not only the extent to which gender norms shape psychiatric practice but also how psychiatry's expansion into the problems of everyday life has led to psychiatry taking a more subtle and yet more active role in enforcing societal norms."}, {"Title": "[Mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: an investigation of the CERAD-NP test battery].", "Abstract": "To investigate the psychometric properties of the German version of the CERAD-NP, neuropsychological deficits were compared between 49 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 80 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 36 with major depression (MD), and 26 elderly controls. All participants were outpatients of the memory clinic of the Section of Geriatric Psychiatry, Heidelberg University. Diagnoses were established based on clinical examination, laboratory testing, neuroimaging, and routine neuropsychological testing according to the criteria of aging-associated cognitive decline (AACD) for MCI, NINCDS-ADRDA for AD, and DSM-IV for MD, respectively. All CERAD-NP subtests discriminated between controls and AD patients with the latter showing significantly (p< or = 0.05) lower test scores. The subtests verbal fluency and constructive apraxia differed significantly between mildly and moderately AD, while the subtests assessing declarative (epsisodic) memory performance showed only minor, non-significant differences between the respective groups. The LKB patients took an intermediate position between controls and AD patients with significantly lower scores in verbal fluency and declarative memory performance than the controls. When compared with the AD patients, MCI patients were significantly impaired in all subtests except constructive apraxia. Relative to the controls, the patients with MD showed a decreased episodic memory performance but no evidence suggesting an impairment in other neuropsychological domains. Our results indicate that the CERAD-NP is a psychometric instrument which allows a sensitive discrimination between mild and moderate AD, MCI, MD and healthy controls. However, sensitivity of discrimination between different stages of dementia varies with respect to the different subtest. While the subtest for episodic memory showed floor effects already for mild dementia, subtests for verbal fluency and constructive apraxia were able to discriminate even between more advanced stages of the disease."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric interventions with returning soldiers at Walter Reed.", "Abstract": "War is a malefic force and results in many psychiatric and medical casualties.

The data were compared with those from a population survey that had recently been carried out in Germany. In all three surveys, the same sampling procedure and fully structured interview were applied.\nAlthough respondents from all three countries were equally inclined to seek help from mental health professionals, those from Bratislava and Novosibirsk tended to recommend more frequently to address other medical or nonmedical professionals or members of the lay support system. In all three countries, psychotherapy was the most favored treatment modality, followed by psychotropic medication. Although natural remedies were more frequently recommended in Bratislava and Novosibirsk, meditation/yoga was more popular among the German public. Across all three countries, the endorsement of a brain disease as cause was associated with a greater willingness to seek help from medical professionals (psychiatrist, GP). Respondents who adopted biological causes tended to recommend psychotropic medication more frequently.\nIn countries with less developed mental health care systems, there appears to be a tendency of the public toward more frequently relying on helping sources outside the mental health sector and on traditional \"alternative\" treatment methods.

During long-term treatment, the onset of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is common, but few cases of severe hypotonic polyuria, which would be an aggravating factor, have been reported. Appropriate treatment in such cases is an open question.\nWe report a case of acute lithium poisoning in a 42-year-old man, due to chronic lithium treatment (plasma lithium=2.6 mmol/L). This patient, admitted to our intensive care unit, presented neurological disorders complicated by the early emergence of severe nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. After perfusion of hypotonic solution and intravenous treatment with ketoprofen (100 mg x 3/24 h), the polyuria improved rapidly.\nThe beneficial action of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs lies in their capacity to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. Lithium causes excess production of prostaglandins, which decrease the ability of kidneys to reabsorb free water. Some publications report indomethacin to be effective in this case. Because it is available only in oral or rectal forms, however, its effect may be delayed. Our case suggests that intravenous ketoprofen, with its rapid onset of action, is effective in the treatment of severe lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

The aims of the study were to determine the frequency of off-label prescribing of psychotropics for inpatients with mild intellectual disability (ID) and mental illness resident in a large psychiatric hospital, the nature of the off-label clinical indications and details about patient consent and case note documentation of the off-label usage.\nCross-sectional survey of inpatients of the ID division of a charitable hospital was carried out. Interviews with consultant psychiatrists about off-label use of psychotropics were also made.\nOf the 56 patients studied, 38 (67.9%) were receiving one or more psychotropic drugs and 26 (46.4%) were receiving at least one off-label psychotropic. The most frequently cited off-label indications were: reduction of aggression, arousal and behavioural disturbance (14 cases) and mood stabilization of affective disturbance (13). The principle psychotropics involved were atypical antipsychotics (17 cases) and mood stabilizers (13). Although in most instances the psychiatrist was aware the drug was being used off-label and had consulted other professionals, in only two (6%) instances had the patient been informed of the off-label usage, largely because the psychiatrist felt they lacked the capacity to understand the off-label concept. In most cases the off-label usage had not been documented in the case notes.\nOff-label prescribing is common in patients with comorbid ID and mental disorder. When prescribing off-label, psychiatrists need to consider the evidence that the drug is likely to be effective for the unlicensed indication and any risks involved. Where there is limited evidence of benefit a trial of the drug, with clinical monitoring may be indicated. Patients should be fully informed about their medication. However, many patients with ID cannot understand the off-label concept. In some circumstances psychiatrists may find it helpful to consult other professionals before prescribing off-label.

However, recent research has suggested that touching can play an important role in psychiatric treatment once a caring relationship has been established. The aim of this study is to investigate the meaning of physical contact for patients who have been treated for psychosis. Through four in-depth interviews and a life-world analysis the results show that touching means to be in need, to yearn, and to belong. Furthermore, touching also communicates feelings between bodies and, as such, it can be a path through which one feels acknowledged as a human being.

This study was designed to investigate ERPs associated with a specific working memory updating process. ERPs were recorded from 10 patients and 10 controls during two visual tasks where (a) targets were a specific word or (b) targets were consecutive matching words. In the first task, nontarget words are not retained in working memory. In the second task, as in delay-match-to-sample tasks, a non-target word defines a new target identity, so these words are retained in working memory. This working memory updating process was related to large positive ERPs over frontal and parietal areas at 400-800 ms, which were smaller in PTSD. Estimation of cortical source activity indicated abnormal patterns of frontal and parietal activity in PTSD, which were also observed in regional cerebral blood flow [Clark, C.R., McFarlane, A.C., Morris, P., Weber, D.L., Sonkkilla, C., Shaw, M., Marcina, J., Tochon-Danguy, H., Egan, G., 2003.

Both widely publicised their procedure, yet, Burckhardt was condemned and no one ventured to repeat his operation, whereas Moniz's leucotomy was accepted and it soon entered mainstream psychiatry. The change of Zeitgeist does not explain the difference as the thinking in the time of Burckhardt, dominated by Griesinger's 'mental illness is an illness of the brain' doctrine, would appear to be more favourable to psychosurgery than it was in the time of Moniz. Moniz reported far more favourable results, which no doubt impressed other practitioners. But most of all the adoption of psychosurgery was due to the interest in mental illness of nonpsychiatrists--neurologists and neurosurgeons--, and the arrival of the new treatment marks a change in the professional configuration of those who treat psychiatric afflictions.

Furthermore, we do not know why some members of the general population have anomalous experiences but remain well, while others enter the prodrome of psychosis, and a minority progress to frank schizophrenia. We suggest that genes or developmental damage result in individuals vulnerable to dopamine deregulation. In contemporary society, this is often compounded by abuse of drugs such as amphetamines and cannabis, which then propel the individual into a state of dopamine-induced misinterpretation of the environment. Certain types of social adversity such as migration and social isolation, as well as affective change can also contribute to this.

The diagnostics and treatment of dissociative disorders have been limited by lack of comprehensive, reliable and valid instruments and the ongoing polarization and fierce controversy regarding treatment. However, recent neurobiological findings of neurochemical, functional and structural cerebral consequences of early stressful childhood experiences point out a need for active, early and effective identification and treatment interventions. We present an update on assessment tools available in the Nordic countries, and an overview of different appropriate therapeutic intervention models for children and adolescents. A systematic overview of studies of dissociation in children and adolescent published over the last decade disclosed a total of 1019 references. The 465 papers describing aspects of assessment tools and/or treatment were studied in detail. Reliable and valid screening questionnaires and diagnostic interviews for children and adolescents now allow for effective early identification of dissociative disorders. A combination of individual psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and family therapy are often required to handle dissociative disorders in children and adolescents. Cognitive-behavioural therapy, hypnotherapy, Eye-Movement Desensitization-Reprocessing (EMDR), psychodynamic therapy and an integrated approach are the main described psychotherapeutic approaches, but treatment of dissociation in children and adolescent does not require allegiance to any one particular treatment model. However, achievement of physical safety by providing a safe environment is a primary goal that supersedes any other therapeutic work. Assessments tools are now available, and appropriate therapeutic intervention models may hopefully contribute to reduce the risk of wrong diagnoses and inappropriate treatment of dissociative symptomatology in children and adolescents. However, controlled clinical trials of the various interventions and longitudinal outcome studies are needed."}, {"Title": "Clinical neuropsychiatric symptoms in perpetrators of severe crimes against persons.", "Abstract": "The objective of the study was to explore the possibility of common signs and symptoms of childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorders and personality disorders, especially psychopathy, in a cohort of violent offenders.

One or several childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorders [autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD), tics and learning disability] affected the majority of adult offenders. A factor analysis yielded four higher-order problem constellations: Executive Dysfunction, Compulsivity, Social Interaction Problems and Superficiality. All four constellations were positively correlated with life histories of aggression, stressing the clinical importance of these problems in adult forensic psychiatry. Compulsivity and Social Interaction Problems were associated with autistic traits and tics, Executive Dysfunction with AD/HD, conduct disorder and psychopathic as well as autistic traits. Superficiality was a distinct aspect of AD/HD and psychopathic traits, especially the PCL-R factor reflecting interpersonal callousness.

The problem-based learning (PBL) method was used, combined with multidisciplinary teamwork. The present paper reports on changes Finnish GPs' perceptions of their knowledge and skills in child psychiatry over a 1-year period. The study sample comprised 761 physicians working in health centres in the area of Tampere University Hospital, with a catchment population of one million. GPs' self-assessments of their skills in child psychiatry in 16 areas were collected by postal questionnaire in 2000 and 2001. The response rates were 66.1% and 57.1%, respectively. Those who answered in both years were included in the analysis (n=371). Some GPs felt that their skills and competencies had improved and some that they had declined, while the majority reported no changes. According to logistic regression analysis, the only factor explaining a marked positive change was participation in child psychiatric training. In two areas of competence, GPs who had attended child psychiatric training rated their skills as significantly better than those who had not attended such training.

Dysfunctional stress responses, emotional-based style of functioning, hyperarousal, anxiety, irritability, impulsivity, disengaged attention and educational underachievement may thus begin to be better understood. The aim of this overview is to give an update on the concept of dissociation and the links to new neurobiological findings, hopefully to reduce unawareness, wrong diagnostics or even neglect of dissociative symptomatology by clinicians in child and adolescent psychiatry in the Nordic countries. A systematic overview of studies of mental dissociation in children and adolescents published over the last decade disclosed a total of 1019 references; 309 papers regarding the concept of dissociation, memory, trauma and the neurobiological correlates were studied in detail. The assumption of a trauma-genic basis of dissociation is still most discussed in the literature. The importance of other childhood trauma in addition to sexual abuse is outlined, focusing on childhood interpersonal trauma. Recent research on traumatized children and adolescents has demonstrated some permanent neurochemical as well as functional and structural abnormalities in brain areas that are involved in the integrative process of cognition and memory. This research begins to clarify the cerebral basis and mechanisms for the trauma-related dissociation observed in dissociative (conversion) disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and somatoform disorders. New perspectives on the nature of subcortical processes linking the phenomena of dissociation and traumatic experiences may have important implications for the understanding of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents. They may be regarded as complex environmentally induced developmental, supporting the view that PTSD and somatization disorders may be specific forms of dissociative processes to be categorized together with dissociative (conversion) disorders as \"trauma-related dissociative disorders\"."}, {"Title": "Wellness at work: enhancing the quality of our working lives.", "Abstract": "This paper was prepared for the International Review of Psychiatry as part of an effort to improve understanding of the connection between employee health and performance and to begin to identify new strategies through which treating wellness as an investment in human capital can lead to greater organizational success.

Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for sleep regulation has considerably advanced since the discovery of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, about half a century ago. Based on standardized electroencephalographic, electro-oculographic and electromyographic features, two distinct main states periodically alternating throughout the night have been identified: REM and non-REM sleep; the latter is further distinguished into stages 1, 2, 3 and 4. Computerized analysis of sleep recordings yielded more detailed information on sleep physiology and pathology. Although still preliminary, neuroimaging studies promise to elucidate the functional alterations of neuronal substrates during sleep. Regarding sleep disorders, which account for a substantial individual and socio-economic burden, considerable progress has been achieved in terms of their classification, assessment, clinical diagnosis and treatment. Specific sleep disorders within the three major categories, that is, 'dysomnias', 'parasomnias', and 'sleep disorders associated with mental, neurologic, or other medical conditions', exhibit characteristic clinical features; sleep laboratory recordings considerably assist to definitely diagnose several among them. Pertinence of sleep medicine for psychiatrists is obvious, taking into consideration that psychiatric disorders account for the largest diagnostic group of patients with sleep problems.

We examine the syndromes of mood disorder with psychotic features, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia with mood features, reviewing their classification, clinical features, course, and treatment. We provide evidence that, clinically, mood disorders and schizophrenia do not separate neatly. We will also review data arising from studies in brain imaging, molecular neurobiology, and genetics. Evidence is accumulating that overlap across diagnostic boundaries for both pathologic and etiologic factors exist, along with disorder-specific factors.

Study methods and the adherence scoring algorithm have been described elsewhere. The current paper addresses the relationships between patient characteristics, provider experience with the algorithm, provider adherence, and clinical outcomes. Measurement of provider adherence includes evaluation of visit frequency, medication choice and dosing, and response to patient symptoms. An exploratory composite 'adherence by visit' score was developed for these analyses.\nA total of 1948 visits from 141 subjects were evaluated, and utilized a two-stage declining effects model. Providers with more experience using the algorithm tended to adhere less to treatment recommendations. Few patient factors significantly impacted provider adherence. Increased adherence to algorithm recommendations was associated with larger decreases in overall psychiatric symptoms and depressive symptoms over time, but did not impact either immediate or long-term reductions in manic symptoms.\nGreater provider adherence to treatment guideline recommendations was associated with greater reductions in depressive symptoms and overall psychiatric symptoms over time.

Both patient groups showed no differences on CGI at admission. Patients treated with atypical antipsychotics showed a significantly greater clinical improvement after 14 d (p<0.005) and on discharge (p<0.05) than patients treated with typical neuroleptics. Furthermore, patients treated with atypical antipsychotics developed significantly less extrapyramidal side-effects (p<0.01) and were significantly treated less often with benzodiazepines (p<0.05) during the first 14 d compared to the group receiving typical neuroleptics.

Residents value their roles as teachers and desire training programs in teaching skills. Teaching skills courses for residents have been shown to improve residents' self-confidence and self-assessed use of effective teaching behaviors. They have also been shown to improve residents' evaluations by students. The Institute for Medical Education at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine has developed a successful, multidisciplinary curriculum to improve the teaching and leadership skills of all of our residents at the Mount Sinai Hospital and its affiliate institutions. The Resident Teaching Development Program (RTDP) has already been implemented in the departments of Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, and Obstetrics and Gynecology. This adaptable, seven-hour curriculum has been well received by residents and faculty. We are currently evaluating the effects of the program on residents' confidence and use of learned skills. And we are working to expand this program to every department and to create innovative means of measuring resident competency in teaching and its ultimate effect on student learning."}, {"Title": "Taking a medical history in childhood illness: representations of parents in pediatric texts since 1850.", "Abstract": "The pediatric clinical encounter is initiated when a sick child is presented to a physician and the physician takes a history from the parent. This article casts the physician's construction of that encounter in a central role in the history of the theory and practice of children's medicine. The focus is on what physicians have written about the conduct of such encounters, and specifically on their attitudes to and instructions for the taking of a history. This analysis reveals that medical writings on the taking of a medical history provide a window into how pediatric writers wanted their discipline to be conducted, what they identified as the normative principles of pediatric practice, and how they portrayed parents. The texts show a striking continuity in the ambivalence expressed by practitioner authors about the parental role in the clinical assessment of sick children. What emerges is both a regret that the physician must be dependent on parental history for clinical assessment, and a message that any doctor dealing with children should both value the parental history and distrust it. Because history taking is a fundamental, core medical activity, these normative principles and representations of parents were dispersed easily, widely, and unconsciously within pediatric practice. They also provide a link to the wider contexts of physicians' involvement in child rearing, the influence of psychiatry, and the fundamental gender structure of the clinical encounter."}, {"Title": "Tobacco industry influence on the definition of tobacco related disorders by the American Psychiatric Association.", "Abstract": "The Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, third edition (DSM-III), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in 1980, included the first official definitions by the APA of tobacco dependence and tobacco withdrawal. Tobacco industry efforts to influence the DSM-III were investigated.\nSearches of previously secret tobacco industry documents, primarily the University of California San Francisco Legacy Tobacco Documents Library and British American Tobacco collections. Additional information was collected through discussions with editors of DSM-III, and library and general internet searches.\nThe tobacco companies regarded the inclusion of tobacco dependence as a diagnosis in DSM-III as an adverse event. It worked to influence the content of the DSM-III and its impact following publication. These efforts included public statements and private lobbying of DSM-III editors and high ranking APA officers by prominent US psychiatrists with undisclosed ties to the tobacco industry. Following publication of DSM-III, tobacco companies contracted with two US professors of psychiatry to organise a conference and publish a monograph detailing controversies surrounding DSM-III.\nThe tobacco industry and its allies lobbied to narrow the definition of tobacco dependence in serial revisions of DSM-III. Following publication of DSM-III, the industry took steps to try to mitigate its impact. These actions mirror industry tactics to influence medical research and policy in various contexts worldwide.

Intuitively, the CVLT-C would be expected to be highly related to a child's verbal cognitive abilities; however, with only a few exceptions, the relationship of this test to various domains of cognitive function has not been broadly studied empirically. To examine this issue, we evaluated the amount of unique variance in CVLT-C scores that could be predicted by the Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Organization, Freedom from Distractibility, and Processing Speed indices of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition (WISC-III) beyond that accounted for by age and gender in a sample of 62 children referred to an outpatient psychiatry clinic for neuropsychological evaluation. While the Processing Speed Index predicted a significant amount of variance for both short and long delay free and cued recall, the Verbal Comprehension Index was a poor predictor of CVLT-C performance on all outcome variables, accounting for only 1.5 to 4.5% additional variance above age and gender. These findings indicate that while the CVLT-C may be relatively independent of influences of verbal intelligence and abstract verbal reasoning, general speed and efficiency of processing play an important role in successful encoding for later retrieval on the CVLT-C."}, {"Title": "Internalized heterosexism, alcohol use, and alcohol-related problems among lesbians and gay men.", "Abstract": "Research regarding internalized heterosexism in relation to alcohol use and alcohol-related problems has suffered from methodological problems.

It is asserted that this milieu is the most important factor in shaping scientific theorizing. Some examples are cited: the rejection of the evidence that the world orbits around the sun (suspected by Pythagoras) in favor of centuries-long firm adherence to the Ptolemaic geocentric system; the early acceptance of Natural Selection in spite of its tautological essence and only conjectural supporting evidence, because it justified contemporaneous social-political ideologies as typified by, e.g., Spencer and Malthus. Economic, social, and cultural factors are cited as providing the ground, i.e., ideational substrate, for what is cited as the Discreetness-Chance Paradigm (DCP), that has increasingly dominated physics, biology, and medicine for over a century and which invokes small, discrete packets of energy/matter (quanta, genes, microorganisms, aberrant cells) functioning within an environment of statistical, not determined, causality. There is speculation on a possible paradigmatic shift from the DCP, which has fostered the proliferation, parallel with (\"splitting\") taxonomy, of alleged individual disease entities, their diagnoses, and, when available, their specific remedies, something particularly prominent in, e.g., psychiatry's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, a codified compendium of alleged mental and behavioral disorders, but evident in any textbook of diagnosis and treatment of physical ailments. This presumed paradigm shift may be reflected in Western medicine, presently increasingly empirical and atomized, towards a growing acceptance of a more generalized, subject-oriented, approach to health and disease, a non-material-based system of energy flow dependent only on vitality, not anatomy; and a more cohesive, integrative patient-centered approach to therapy."}, {"Title": "Geriatrics training and education for nongeriatrician faculty: the Dean's Faculty Scholars in Aging Program.", "Abstract": "The University of South Carolina School of Medicine in Columbia implemented the Dean's Faculty Scholars in Aging (DFSA) Program in 2001 to strengthen the knowledge of geriatrics of nongeriatrician faculty members. The primary indicator of strengthening physicians' geriatrics knowledge was the development of new educational experiences by physicians in the DFSA Program. Twenty-six nongeriatrician faculty in seven departments were recruited to participate as scholars. Most scholars were in key educational positions, including assistant deans, department chairs, and clerkship and residency directors. Scholars received special training to develop geriatrics educational experiences based on their medical specialty and interests. Training encouraged cross-departmental collaboration. Scholars also had access to resources, including professional geriatric educators. Funds were available to support development of educational experiences and for a small amount of salary support. Since the program was implemented, 36 new geriatric experiences have been developed, 29 of the 36 were implemented, and 11 of the 36 were evaluated. Experiences included an elective for residents in the care of older patients in the emergency room and a required hospice rotation in the psychiatry clerkship for third-year medical students. All scholars developed a geriatrics educational experience, and most implemented one.

Meta-analyses of trials in major depressive disorder (MDD) suggest that drug-placebo differences in response rates range from 11% to 18%. However, in trials of marketed antidepressants present in the FDA databases, antidepressant drugs were superior to placebo in only 45 out of 93 RCTs (48%), and the placebo response overall appears to have increased over time. This gradual increase in placebo response rates may lead to delays in bringing new antidepressant treatments to the market, increased costs of antidepressant drug development and, in some cases, decisions to stop the development of certain compounds, or FDA decisions to not approve new treatments. A number of possible contributing factors to this significant placebo response in MDD have been identified, but further studies are needed. Many of the remedies used by researchers to minimize the placebo response, such as lead-in periods or shortening the duration of study visits, have failed to show consistent benefits. From our analysis of published studies, it appears that expectations about the speed of response may be shaped by the duration of the trial and that most of the placebo response occurs in the first half of the trial, regardless of its duration. These observations have led us to develop a novel approach to the placebo response problem called the Sequential Parallel Comparison Design."}, {"Title": "Psychopathologic correlates of suicidal ideation in major depressive outpatients: is it all due to unrecognized (bipolar) depressive mixed states?", "Abstract": "Recent transatlantic concern about suicidality in patients receiving antidepressants prompted us to examine the psychopathologic correlates of suicidal ideation occurring in clinically depressed patients.\nThe study sample, which consisted of 644 consecutive major depressive outpatients, of which 58.0% had bipolar II disorder (BP-II), was systematically interviewed with the SCID, in order to delineate the diagnostic and psychopathologic correlates of suicidal ideation.\nSuch ideation, which was present in 49.5% [and favoring BP-II vs. major depressive disorder (MDD)] at an odds ratio (OR) of 1.3 (95% confidence interval = 0.98-1.8), was clinically significantly associated with depressive mixed state (racing/crowded thoughts and psychomotor agitation/activation during index depression), mood lability, decreased self-esteem, anorexia, as well as melancholic and psychotic features. Multiple logistic regression of suicidal ideation versus depressive symptoms and intradepressive excitatory symptoms revealed that decreased self-esteem (OR = 3.3), racing/crowded thoughts (OR = 1.5), and psychomotor agitation/activation (OR = 1.4) were independent and clinically significant correlates of suicidal ideation, irrespective of depression severity.\nFrom a psychopathologic standpoint, suicidality might be conferred by a combination of both the excited (mixed) depressive and agitated (melancholic) clusters. Trait mood lability appears to favor the genesis of these affective clusters. Within the framework of Kraepelinian psychiatry, both clusters represent depressive mixed states. Given that such states are more prevalent in BP-II, our data provide a possible explanation for the greater suicidality in BP-II patients reported in the literature. In light of the higher odds of suicidal ideation in BP-II versus MDD patients, we hypothesize that the higher prevalence of mental and psychomotor activation in BP-II might be one factor among others that favors the greater likelihood of the transition from suicidal ideation to suicidal action in BP-II. Our analyses delineate a mixed depressive substrate at risk for suicidality. To what extent, if any, antidepressant monotherapy might contribute to the genesis of such states and/or suicidality cannot be answered with the methodology of the present study."}, {"Title": "Finding genes in child psychology and psychiatry: when are we going to be there?", "Abstract": "The seven papers in this special section chart where we are in the quest for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in key areas of child psychology and psychiatry such as reading and hyperactivity. But we are not there yet.\nThis commentary considers some new developments that are likely to accelerate the journey towards the identification of QTLs.\nThe single most important factor is the need for very large samples to attain adequate power to detect and replicate QTLs of very small effect size. Another important development is the microarray, which makes it possible to genotype hundreds of thousands of SNPs simultaneously. Using microarrays in association studies allows SNPs across the whole genome to be genotyped. Microarrays will boost power even more when they contain all functional polymorphisms in the genome, including functional non-coding DNA.\nOnce replicable QTLs are identified in areas such as reading and hyperactivity, the real journey will begin. Future studies will use sets of QTLs as genetic risk indicators in top-down behavioural genomic research, leading to gene-based diagnoses, gene-based treatments tailored to the individual, and early warning systems and interventions. These discoveries will eventually help to prevent or at least ameliorate childhood disorders before they cast their long shadow over development."}, {"Title": "Primary care psychiatry: taking consultation-liaison psychiatry to the community.", "Abstract": "To assist psychiatrists who work closely with general practitioners (GPs) at the primary/secondary care interface.\nThe role of primary care psychiatrists can be enhanced by a sound appreciation of the general practice context, knowledge of the local mental health services and an understanding of the educational and clinical support needs of GPs."}, {"Title": "Training models for psychiatry in primary care: a new frontier.", "Abstract": "Under policies implemented by the Australian Government, the success of community mental health care has increasingly relied upon general practitioners (GPs) assuming an enhanced role in the delivery of evidence-based psychological treatment.

This pilot study investigates the potential role of CBT group supervision as a training model.\nTwo groups of GPs (n = 9) and one comparison group of psychiatric registrars (n = 4) completed eight 1.5 h sessions of CBT group supervision over an 8 month period. Pre- to post-training measures were taken of GP performance (skills, knowledge and confidence) and the mental health outcomes of their patients. On the completion of group supervision, focus groups were conducted for in-depth feedback.\nRandomization tests indicated that GPs' confidence and knowledge in using CBT had improved over the course of group supervision. Results from focus groups confirmed that GPs' CBT skills had improved.\nFindings suggest that group supervision is a promising training model for psychiatry in primary care. Cognitive behaviour therapy should be replaced, however, with a briefer therapy model, such as brief CBT, better suited to a general practice environment.

These guidelines are intended for use by all physicians seeing and treating people with schizophrenia. The data used for developing these guidelines have been extracted primarily from various national treatment guidelines and panels for schizophrenia, as well as from meta-analyses, reviews and randomised clinical trials on the efficacy of pharmacological and other biological treatment interventions identified by a search of the MEDLINE database and Cochrane Library. The identified literature was evaluated with respect to the strength of evidence for its efficacy and then categorised into four levels of evidence (A-D). This first part of the guidelines covers disease definition, classification, epidemiology and course of schizophrenia, as well as the management of the acute phase treatment.

Despite strong recommendation by experts to employ monotherapy whenever possible, the prevalence of antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP) has greatly increased, particularly since the advent of the Second Generation Antipsychotics (SGA). The literature which consists of three RCTs, several naturalistic cohort studies and numerous case reports does not show convincing evidence of APP efficacy. The best results were seen in studies of augmentation of clozapine response by a second antipsychotic. Studies which examined the side effect burden showed higher rates of anticholinergic and extrapyramidal side effects of APP compared to monotherapy, but these differences tended to disappear when total dosage was controlled for. The relative cost of APP may be higher than monotherapy, but very little data are available. Experts recommend APP in a few special clinical situations: (a) for augmentation when a patient fails to respond to adequate antipsychotic trials, especially with clozapine; (b) in some instances of failed cross-taper of antipsychotics; (c) adding a FGA to a SGA for agitation during acute treatment of psychosis.

Part I: The electroencephalogram.", "Abstract": "While there is an increasing body of knowledge in regard to central nervous system function and/or the mode of action of centrally active agents on neuronal function, little is done to develop new techniques on how to measure such changes. Also, monitoring of the cardiovascular system in the past has made extensive progress especially when it comes to evaluate the failing heart. In contrast monitoring of the central nervous system is only done in rare cases where operative procedures likely impede nervous function integrity. Since in the past decade the aging population undergoing operation has rise considerably, the risk of cerebral malperfusion or minute signs of degradation of the aging central nervous system (CNS) to anesthetics and agents being used in the operation room (OR) or the intensive care unit (ICU), needs continuous monitoring of an organ which presents the highest vulnerability and is likely to deteriorate faster than the cardiovascular system. In spite the rapid improvement in technology regarding the electroencephalogram (EEG) and evoked potential monitoring, physicians still are reluctant to use a technology on a routine base, which will give them insight information into brain function and activity. Such \"windows to the brain\" now not just are reserved to specialists working in the area of neurology and/or psychiatry. More so, cerebral monitoring is getting an integrated part in the overall therapy in patients undergoing operation or who need ventilatory support in the ICU as it effects the well-being and the outcome. The present book therefore, is intended for the practitioners who work with the patient, guide the clinician in his decision making and outlining those situations where cerebral monitoring presents an integrated part in the diagnosis and therapy of patient care. Without going too much into the technical details, representative cases underline the potential use of cerebral monitoring in the underlying clinical situation where either the patient presents borderline perfusion of the CNS, undergoes vascular surgery, or where monitoring of cerebral function in the intensive care in a head trauma patients is an integrated part in therapy. The book therefore is meant for all those clinicians who have to deal with the CNS in a day-to-day situation. This may be the anesthesiologist, the surgeon, the intensive care therapist, the nurse anesthetist as well as all other medical personal involved in intensive care therapy. The aim of the book therefore is to outline the possibilities, the limitations, and the options for therapy when the windows to the brain are opened, how to interpret the data in the light of other physiological parameters and aid the user in the technical details of how to avoid artifacts in recording which may have an impact on final decision making. Therefore, emphasis is placed on the electrode placement, artifact and electrical noise reduction, as well as data interpretation so that cerebral function diagnosis can be made on reliable grounds. The following serves as an introduction to and as a reference guide for Cerebral Monitoring in the OR and the ICU: Gives complete coverage of EEG power spectra analysis.

Describes in detail the major features of EEG power spectra and evoked potential measurements, including amplifiers, filter setting and microprocessor algorithm for data reduction. Gives suggestions for assessing and improving signal quality, including noise and artifact rejection, which usually are encountered in the operation room and the intensive care unit, both of which can be considered as electrically contaminated. Gives examples of EEG power spectra and evoked potential monitoring related to different types of anesthesia, in coma, after head trauma, and for the detection of ischemic events.

The inconsistent findings with respect to the neuropathology and neurobehavior of patients with histories of alcohol abuse may be due, at least in part, to differing nosology and the highly variable inclusion/exclusion criteria employed by researchers. Oslin et al. [Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 1998;13:203-212] have proposed and recently validated specific criteria for probable alcohol-related dementia (ARD). We were interested in comparing the neuropsychological profile of ARD patients with the neurocognitive profiles of typical cortical and subcortical dementia patients. Participants included 14 ARD patients, 15 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 13 patients diagnosed with subcortical vascular dementia (VaD), and 20 normal controls. Patient subgroups were similar with respect to age (mean = 79), education (mean = 12 years) and dementia severity (MMSE; mean = 22.1). The three dementia patient subgroups demonstrated significantly worse performance than the normal controls subgroup on all neuropsychological tests. The ARD subgroup exhibited very similar executive control deficits to VaD patients. However, the different neurocognitive profiles of the patient subgroups suggest that ARD patients may also, in fact, demonstrate some degree of amnesia given that they perform slightly worse than subcortical patients on delayed verbal free recall and recognition. Nonetheless, the ARD patients did not display as severe impairment as the AD patients on the memory tasks. No significant differences between the three patient groups were identified on language tests. In sum, we present preliminary evidence of a distinct neuropsychological profile for ARD patients that includes impairment on both executive control and memory tests. This pattern of performance suggests that long-term alcohol abuse, in comparison to AD and VaD, may be associated with both cortical and subcortical neuropathology."}, {"Title": "Proposed geriatric psychiatry core competencies for subspecialty training.", "Abstract": "The authors present and discuss the theoretical and practical development of proposed core competencies for subspecialty training and certification in geriatric psychiatry as required by the Accreditation Council For Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN).

Professional, demographic, and patient data are compared between general and self-reported geriatric psychiatrists. Authors also present detailed analyses comparing high geriatric providers (HGPs; geriatric caseloads >20%), and board-certified geriatric psychiatrists (BCGPs).\nThe proportion of HGPs in the 2002 NSPP was 26.0% of all respondents and was 28.1% among American Psychiatric Association (APA)-member respondents. Among the APA-member psychiatrists, this reflected a 55% increase from the 1996 NSPP. Of HGPs, 31.0% were certified in geriatric psychiatry. As compared with general psychiatrists, proportionally fewer men and American medical-school graduates were self-reported geriatric psychiatrists. Geriatric psychiatrists saw nearly three times as many geriatric patients and five times as many dementia patients as did their generalist counterparts. Mood-disorder patients were the largest treatment group, however. Investigators observed no significant differences in professional and practice characteristics between HGPs and BCGPs.\nAbout 1 in 4 psychiatrists in the 2002 survey are HGPs. Geriatric psychiatrists treat proportionally more geriatric patients than do generalists, but they do not have exclusively geriatric practices. The similarities between HGPs and BCGPs raise issues about the incentives for geriatric psychiatry certification, but not the need to train subspecialists to serve as faculty and community resources."}, {"Title": "Cognitive neuropsychiatry: conceptual, methodological and philosophical perspectives.", "Abstract": "Cognitive neuropsychiatry attempts to understand psychiatric disorders as disturbances to the normal function of human cognitive organisation, and it attempts to link this functional framework to relevant brain structures and their pathology. This recent scientific discipline is the natural extension of cognitive neuroscience into the domain of psychiatry. We present two examples of recent research in cognitive neuropsychiatry: delusions of control in schizophrenia, and affective disorders. The examples demonstrate how the cognitive approach is a fruitful and necessary supplement to the otherwise successful biological psychiatry paradigm, which tend to bypass the cognitive level. Philosophy concerns some of the core concepts involved in psychiatric illness, particularly concerning rationality, thought and action, reality testing, and the self. We present concrete examples that illustrate how philosophical conceptual tools can be particularly important for the construction and interpretation of the cognitive models relevant to the understanding of psychiatric illness. We conclude that cognitive neuropsychiatry is a fruitful and necessary supplement to biological psychiatry. Furthermore, cognitive neuropsychiatry itself may benefit significantly from employing philosophical conceptual tools in the interpretation and construction of its cognitive models. The cognitive and philosophical approaches may thus be further steps towards a scientific psychopathology."}, {"Title": "Forthcoming ethical issues in biological psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Ethical issues in biological psychiatry are framed by (i) progress in the neurosciences, and (ii) a changing socio-cultural context.

Ethical dilemmas in psychiatry develop (i) between the individual's best and the common good (demanded from outside medicine), (ii) among different ethical principles (inside medicine), iii) if solutions are influenced by personal reasons without observing ethical principles.

The authors performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of a genetic test that may identify individuals with greater likelihood of responding to clozapine treatment. We modeled a target population of schizophrenia patients in an acute psychotic episode, using a lifetime time horizon and societal perspective. Outcome measures included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness. Effects of variations in testing parameters were also examined. For a 30-year-old with schizophrenia, applying the pharmacogenetic test and treating those predicted to respond to clozapine with clozapine-first cost US $47,705 per additional quality-adjusted life-year, compared with treating all patients with conventional agents and reserving clozapine for treatment-resistant patients. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, test sensitivity and cost had the greatest impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness.

However, empirical findings on attitudes of psychiatric staff towards patient gender are limited. Gender-related issues are particularly relevant in the debate about mixed versus segregated sex wards, yet while the appropriateness of mixed-sex wards is questioned in Great Britain this is not the case in Germany. To investigate attitudes of psychiatric staff towards both patient gender and mixed versus segregated sex wards, we conducted a case study using focus groups with members of professional teams. We evaluated the transition process from two single-sex wards to two mixed-sex wards in a 330-bed psychiatric hospital in a rural area in south Germany. Staff described female patients as more externally oriented, motivating of others, demanding, and even sexually aggressive. Male patients, on the other hand, were described as more quiet, modest, or lazy. Furthermore, participants described the mixing process as a positive development whereas they did not see a need for gender-separated wards in order to protect vulnerable female patients. Some gender descriptions by professionals are \"reversed\" in comparison with gender stereotypes supposed to be present in wider society. The perception of crossed gender norms may affect staff attitudes towards the vulnerability of female patients in psychiatric settings and the provision of single-sex wards in in-patient psychiatric care. Practical implications are discussed against the background of a high rate of female patients with sexual abuse histories."}, {"Title": "Neuroendocrine predictors of the evolution of depression.", "Abstract": "Depression is both clinically and biologically a heterogeneous entity. Despite advances in psychopharmacology, a significant proportion of depressed patients either continue to have residual symptoms or do not respond to antidepressants. It has therefore become essential to determine parameters (or predictors) that would rationalize the therapeutic choice, taking into account not only the clinical features, but also the \"biological state,\" which is a major determinant in the antidepressant response. Such predictors can derive from bioclinical correlates and, in this context, the neuroendocrine strategy appears particularly suited. Numerous studies have investigated neuroendocrine parameters--derived mainly from dynamic challenge tests--in order to (i) determine the predictive profiles of good clinical responders to given antidepressants; (ii) monitor the progression of markers in parallel with the clinical outcome; and (iii) evaluate \"in vivo\" in humans the mechanisms of action of antidepressant compounds (before, during, and after treatment). This article does not attempt to be exhaustive, but rather uses selected examples to illustrate the usefulness of the investigation of the adrenal and thyroid axes and the assessment of central serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic systems by means of neuroendocrine tests. Given methodological constraints, most of these investigations--except for baseline hormone values and the dexamethasone suppression test--cannot be used routinely in psychiatry. Despite these limitations, the neuroendocrine strategy still offers new insights in biology and the treatment of depression. Its possible expansion depends mainly on the development of specific agonists or antagonists for better investigation of the receptors supposedly involved in the pathophysiology of depression.

This paper advocates a more diversely informed nosology that, in turn, fosters attention to broader diagnostic considerations. We explore more plausible ways in which genetics and genomics, in conjunction with neuroscience and other biological disciplines, can help to shape diagnostic classification in psychiatry. There are, of course, differing views on the degree of prominence that genetics should take in psychiatric diagnosis and classification. We outline these accounts in illustration of this continuum.

Three types of comorbidity include true comorbidity (clinically distinct entities), artifactual comorbidity (a byproduct of the DSM/ICD strategy to split categorical diagnoses) and spurious comorbidity. DSM has established 'mutually exclusive' relationships between disorders to reduce such spurious comorbidity. Four types of mutually exclusive relationships are identified: (1) between disorders that are on different levels of the Kraepelinian-defined hierarchy (e.g., schizophrenia and major depressive disorder); (2) between categories with identical features that are split according to age or duration (schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder); (3) between categories in which the defining features of one disorder are contained in the definition of more broadly-defined disorder (Asperger's disorder and autistic disorder), and (4) between categories in which the defining features of one disorder are an associated feature of another disorder (e.g., dysthymic disorder and schizophrenia). Although less comorbidity may be desirable to reduce diagnostic complexity, in the absence of knowledge about underlying pathophysiology, the trend in successive editions of the DSM has been to reduce diagnostic hierarchies and increase comorbidity (e.g., elimination of exclusion between panic disorder and major depression in DSM-III-R because of evidence of independence). It is important to understand that comorbidity in psychiatry does not imply the presence of multiple diseases or dysfunctions but rather reflects our current inability to apply Occam's razor (i.e., a single diagnosis to account for all symptoms)."}, {"Title": "Diagnosis and reality: a noun is a terrible thing to waste.", "Abstract": "The use of a diagnosis for identifying disease processes has been crucial in the field of medicine. But it is essential that the diagnostic noun represent real processes. In psychiatry, to meet the important criterion of reliability we have focused on objective phenomena. But since psychiatric disorders are human processes and a major aspect of being human is our subjectivity, we also need to pay far more attention to subjective phenomena, even those difficult to define reliably. The arts have much to teach us about the nature of those processes. It is essential that we learn from these and other sources to focus more effectively on subjectivity, and thereby understand the factors that underlie and define psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Values in psychiatric diagnosis: developments in policy, training and research.", "Abstract": "Diagnosis, although traditionally thought to be a value-free scientific process, incorporates values, for example in judgements of impaired functioning and clinical significance. Such judgements are particularly problematic in psychiatry because the values concerned are often diverse and hence potentially conflicting. Values-based practice is the theory and clinical skills-base for effective healthcare decision-making where, as in relation to psychiatric diagnosis, diverse and conflicting values are in play. The paper describes recent developments in values-based practice in the UK and with international partners, in policy (a national framework for values-based practice in mental health service provision), training (a training manual launched recently by the Minister responsible for mental health in the UK) and research (including an international research methods meeting on psychiatric diagnosis funded by the National Institute for Mental Health in England)."}, {"Title": "Bioethics principles, informed consent, and ethical care for special populations: curricular needs expressed by men and women physicians-in-training.", "Abstract": "Physicians-in-training today are learning in an ethical environment that is unprecedented in its complexity. There is a call for new approaches in preparing medical students and residents for the ethical and professional issues they will encounter. The perspectives of physicians-in-training at different levels regarding the level of curricular attention needed for emerging bioethics concepts, practical informed consent considerations, and the care of special populations are unknown.\nThe authors performed a hypothesis-driven, confidential survey study to assess perceived needs and preferences among medical students and residents related to medical ethics education at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine.\nA total of 336 physicians-in-training volunteered (62% response rate). Overall, strong interest was expressed for increased curricular attention to the domains of bioethics principles, informed consent, and care of special populations. Women students expressed greater interest generally. For certain domains, clinical students expressed relatively less curricular need and psychiatry and primary care residents expressed relatively greater curricular need. Two of the four hypotheses were supported, a third received partial support, and a fourth was not supported by the findings.\nTo be valuable and effective, new ethics curricular approaches must be responsive to the current complex ethical environment and attentive to the preferences of medical students and residents of both genders, at different stages of training, with different patient care responsibilities.

Virtually all (96%) of the residents indicated that it was moderately or very important to address cultural issues when providing care. The number of respondents who indicated that they believed they were not prepared to care for diverse cultures in a general sense was only 8%. However, a larger percentage of respondents believed they were not prepared to provide specific components of cross-cultural care, including caring for patients with health beliefs at odds with Western medicine (25%), new immigrants (25%), and patients whose religious beliefs affect treatment (20%). In addition, 24% indicated that they lacked the skills to identify relevant cultural customs that impact medical care. In contrast, only a small percentage of respondents (1%-2%) indicated that they were not prepared to treat clinical conditions or perform procedures common in their specialty. Approximately one third to half of the respondents reported receiving little or no instruction in specific areas of cross-cultural care beyond what was learned in medical school. Forty-one percent (family medicine) to 83% (surgery and obstetrics/gynecology) of respondents reported receiving little or no evaluation in cross-cultural care during their residencies. Barriers to delivering cross-cultural care included lack of time (58%) and lack of role models (31%).\nResident physicians' self-reported preparedness to deliver cross-cultural care lags well behind preparedness in other clinical and technical areas. Although cross-cultural care was perceived to be important, there was little clinical time allotted during residency to address cultural issues, and there was little training, formal evaluation, or role modeling.

This simple formulation underlay a range of 19th century neurological disorders, referred to collectively as disconnection syndromes. Although disconnectionism fell out of favour with the move against localized brain theories in the early 20th century, in 1965, an American neurologist brought disconnection to the fore once more in a paper entitled, 'Disconnexion syndromes in animals and man'. In what was to become the manifesto of behavioural neurology, Norman Geschwind outlined a pure disconnectionist framework which revolutionized both clinical neurology and the neurosciences in general. For him, disconnection syndromes were higher function deficits that resulted from white matter lesions or lesions of the association cortices, the latter acting as relay stations between primary motor, sensory and limbic areas. From a clinical perspective, the work reawakened interest in single case studies by providing a useful framework for correlating lesion locations with clinical deficits. In the neurosciences, it helped develop contemporary distributed network and connectionist theories of brain function. Geschwind's general disconnectionist paradigm ruled clinical neurology for 20 years but in the late 1980s, with the re-emergence of specialized functional roles for association cortex, the orbit of its remit began to diminish and it became incorporated into more general models of higher dysfunction. By the 1990s, textbooks of neurology were devoting only a few pages to classical disconnection theory. Today, new techniques to study connections in the living human brain allow us, for the first time, to test the classical formulation directly and broaden it beyond disconnections to include disorders of hyperconnectivity. In this review, on the 40th anniversary of Geschwind's publication, we describe the changing fortunes of disconnection theory and adapt the general framework that evolved from it to encompass the entire spectrum of higher function disorders in neurology and psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Using the science fiction film invaders from Mars in a child psychiatry seminar.", "Abstract": "The science fiction film Invaders From Mars is used to teach principles of child development; clinical features of separation anxiety and nightmares; and clinical interventions, including child psychotherapy, child protective issues, and crisis management.\nCommercial films have been used as teaching aids in child psychiatry seminars.

The list of possibilities spans virtually every major area of medicine, neurology and psychiatry. Assessment of impaired alertness is largely based on clinical interview and direct observation, but it may also include subjective self-report, objective physiological and behavioural measures, and performance tests. In the primary care setting, a clear and detailed history is invaluable in negotiating these numerous diagnostic considerations. Primary care physicians need to be aware that the patient's complaint may be expressed in terms of 'tiredness' or 'fatigue' rather than a direct reference to impaired alertness or performance. Accurate diagnosis is important, not only because of the negative impact of impaired alertness and its possible underlying causes on health and the quality of the patient's professional and social life, but also because impaired alertness due to poor sleep quality can be remedied with appropriate treatment. Increased understanding of the neurological basis of alertness and sleepiness will undoubtedly lead to improved treatments. To facilitate improved understanding of the symptoms, aetiology, pathophysiology and treatment of impaired alertness, classification of the sleep disorders is necessary to discriminate between disorders. Based on recent advances in knowledge about sleep disorders, the recently published second version of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) has been expanded to include 85 sleep disorders under eight major categories: (1) insomnias, (2) sleep-related breathing disorders, (3) hypersomnias not due to a breathing disorder, (4) circadian rhythm sleep disorders, (5) parasomnias, (6) sleep-related movement disorders, (7) other sleep disorders, and (8) isolated symptoms, apparently due to adverse effect of drugs, medications and biological substances. The ICSD provides relevant information on the diagnostic features and epidemiology to differentiate between sleep disorders, and it will no doubt serve as a core resource in the development of recommendations for primary care physicians to guide the diagnosis and treatment of patients with impaired alertness."}, {"Title": "Does contextual information influence positive and negative schizotypy scores in healthy individuals?

The objectives of the present study were to determine the frequency of psychiatric morbidity amongst recently diagnosed cancer outpatients and try to identify which factors might be related to further psychological distress. Two hundred and eleven (70.9%) female patients and 87 (29.1%) male patients from the chemotherapy unit of the Cancer Hospital A.C.

The Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was administered to the patients to determine their personal psychiatric morbidity. Seventy-two patients (25.8%) scored > or = 8 in the SRQ-20, the cut-off point for a patient to be considered a psychiatric case. When the low and high scoring groups were compared no differences were detected regarding age, marital status, tumor site, sex, or previous treatment. Nonetheless, patients in the lowest social class and those who were bedridden less than 50% of the time had a significantly higher probability of being a psychiatric case. Regarding help-seeking behavior in situations in which they had doubts or were frightened, about 64% of the total sample did not seek any type of support and did not talk to anyone. This frequency of psychiatric morbidity agrees with data from the cancer literature.

Concerning the capacity of action confronted to psychiatric crisis the authors stress the importance of the scenic understanding, expressed symptoms and the acted-out crisis dynamics more than diagnostic classification. The diagnostic and decisive process of atunement to the patient in crisis is being described. A model for psychodynamic understanding of perception of and action towards crisis is proposed, which allows describing the interference between relational dynamics and intra-psychic conflicts leading to crisis.

Census studies in 2001 showed that 429,100 of the population of the Republic of Ireland were aged 65yrs and older, making up 11.2% of the overall population. While the overall population of the Republic is expected to remain stable over the next ten years, the demographic projections for the elderly population is for significant growth: numbers of over 65yrs are expected to increase by nearly 108,000 people between 1996 - 2011, comprising over 14.1% of the overall population. In particular, our communities will contain a much higher proportion of octogenarians and nonagenarians: at present 21% of our over 65's are 80 yrs or older; by 2011, it is projected that this number will increase to 25%. In tandem, the prevalence of dementia will increase. In 2000, it was estimated that 31,000 people suffered with dementia in the Republic of Ireland, and this figure is expected to increase by 5000 cases per year between 2001-2011. The ultimate outcome of this demographic shift, will be higher demands on medical services for older people, especially geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry. This paper will focus on two particular aspects of management which will increasingly impact on the work of old age psychiatrists - medicolegal issues and management issues in dementia."}, {"Title": "A longitudinal study of depression in old age II: depression and physical disability.", "Abstract": "As part of an outcome study of depression in older people, the relationship between physical disability and depression was explored at baseline and longitudinally. The aims were to identify whether illness in specific body systems or physical disability was associated with a poorer outcome of depression.\nSubjects over 65 with depression referred to an old age psychiatry service were recruited. Depression was diagnosed according to ICD-10 criteria. An in-depth initial assessment obtained data concerning depression severity and illness in specific body systems as well as disability levels. Objective and subjective ratings of health status were also made. Subjects were followed up at three, six, 12, 18, and 24 months. Ongoing assessments were made of depressive symptomatology and of physical status.\nSubjects with higher disability levels had more severe depression at baseline. There was no relationship between illness in specific body systems and depression severity. At follow up assessments, those with higher disability scores had poorer outcomes as recorded by depression rating scales and by reviewing the longitudinal course of depression in terms of proportions remaining well, suffering relapses or remaining depressed.\nThere is an ongoing relationship between depression and disability. Older people with greater physical disability have a poorer outcome of depression. Service providers should be aware of this relationship and respond rapidly and assertively to depression in older people with disability. There should be a lower threshold for initiating treatment in this population."}, {"Title": "The Validity of Psychiatric Diagnosis Revisited: The Clinician's Guide to Improve the Validity of Psychiatric Diagnosis.", "Abstract": "The authors reviewed the types and phases of validity of psychiatric diagnosis.

In the absence of the gold standard of psychiatric diagnosis, Spitzer proposed the \"LEAD,\" which is an acronym for longitudinal evaluation, and is done by expert clinicians utilizing all the data available. The LEAD standard is construct validity at the level of experts; however, guidelines are lacking to improve the validity skills of the practicing clinicians.\nThe authors propose the acronym DR.SEE, which stands for data, reference definitions, rating scales, clinical experience, and external validators.

The criteria for establishing psychiatric diagnoses and the differences between historical types of extreme fasting also support the historical novelty of anorexia nervosa.\nThe etiologic implications of the historical specificity of anorexia nervosa are limited.

Forty-four regular VLT players were designated either probable pathological gamblers or non-pathological gamblers on the basis of scores on the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS); [Lesieur & Blume (1997). American Journal of Psychiatry, 144, 1184-1188] Gamblers from each SOGS category were randomly assigned to either a moderately intoxicating alcohol dose or a control beverage condition (n = 11 per cell in the 2 x 2 between-subjects design). Following beverage consumption and absorption, participants played a video poker VLT game for up to 30 minutes. Four behaviors were measured: \"power-bets\" (doubling bet after viewing only two cards of the five-card poker hand); total money spent; mean bet magnitude; and number of minutes played. Alcohol increased time spent playing and rate of power-bets, particular among the probable pathological gamblers. Post hoc analyses revealed that alcohol also influenced the proportion of losing hands played--increasing them among the probable pathological gamblers while decreasing them among the non-pathological gamblers.

Warnings on the administration, results analysis, and recommendations].", "Abstract": "Recent reports and recommendations from national and international health care regulatory authorities have informed us that serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are contraindicated as new treatment for those under 18 years of age with depressive illness. They conclude that SSRI carry the risk of increased suicide-related behavior; although there was no completed suicide. The European Medicine Agency (EMEA) and German regulatory agency (BfArM) advise that these components generally should not be used in this age group except in their other, approved indications. However, it is acknowledged that they may sometimes be chosen, depending on individual clinical needs. Based on these data, the Commission for Child and Adolescent Developmental Psychopharmacology of the German Scientific Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy is trying to give recommendations for the use of SSRI in clinical practice. Recent studies demonstrate that combining SSRI with psychological treatment such as cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of suicidal behavior in depressed children and adolescents."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric referrals during peace and wartimes: a Nigerian experience.", "Abstract": "Using a questionnaire administered by us, we sought to investigate the differences between patients referred to the psychiatric department of a Nigerian military general hospital during peacetime and those referred during the civil war in Liberia in which Nigerian soldiers were involved as peacekeepers. Referrals to psychiatry in peacetime were quite few but increased considerably during the period of combat in direct relation to the increase in the number of surgical wounded in action cases. Organic mental disorders and anxiety disorders were more frequently referred in peacetime than in war, whereas substance abuse disorders were more frequent during the combat period. Non-psychotic psychiatric conditions were less referred in the wartime group, partly because of nonrecognition at the mission areas and also because of recovery in front-line areas or consideration of their evacuation as a nonpriority. Mental health workers engaged at the mission areas require more training in the identification of such cases."}, {"Title": "Using pegylated interferon and ribavirin to treat patients with chronic hepatitis C.", "Abstract": "Hepatitis C virus is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the United States. The advent of new treatment regimens using pegylated interferons in combination with ribavirin has led to improved sustained viral response rates for some genotypes in large multicenter trials. Advances in the management of side effects and toxicities have expanded the pool of treatable patients. A recent National Institutes of Health consensus conference recommended that all patients who have bridging hepatic fibrosis and moderate inflammation together with detectable viremia should receive treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Unfortunately, these medications are very expensive and have significant side effects. Hematologic toxicities include anemia and leukopenia. These can be managed with close monitoring, use of growth factors, or dose reductions. Depression also can be caused or exacerbated by these medicines and may require treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, comanagement with psychiatry, or cessation of pegylated interferon and ribavirin treatment. Contraception is imperative because ribavirin is highly teratogenic. Influenza-like symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and mild fevers can be helped by quality patient education and support including frequent office visits. Data from randomized controlled trials demonstrating improvements in long-term survival as a result of treatment are not yet available, but it appears that patients who have no detectable virus six months after treatment have a good chance of remaining virus free for at least five years."}, {"Title": "A national survey of electroconvulsive therapy use in the Russian Federation.", "Abstract": "A survey of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) throughout Russia was undertaken to understand the range of ECT usage and knowledge.

Nevertheless, most respondents are enthusiastic and positive about ECT, and most institutions are eager to adopt modern ECT methods."}, {"Title": "When mothers leave their children behind.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry has studied the effect on children of separation from their mothers or primary caregivers, but has not given equal attention to the effect on mothers of separation from their children. This article examines the current literature on separation from the mother's perspective. Following a review of the literature on mothers' attachment behaviors, as evidenced by separation from their very young children due to ordinary circumstances, attention will turn to specific populations of mothers enduring separation from their children in situations of hardship: mothers with mental illness, homeless mothers, mothers in prison, and two groups of working mothers-immigrant mothers and deployed navy mothers. Separation can be experienced as temporary, bringing on anxiety, or may involve a mother's choice between her child's safety and her own wish to keep the child near her, causing a conflict in the mother's feelings. In other situations, separation may be involuntary and long-lasting, inducing symptoms of depression, despair, and grief, all of which are characteristic of loss. The particular conditions of the separation-such as choice, control, and ongoing communication between mother and child-can mitigate the impact of the separation and transform it from a total to a partial loss. Three clinical cases of mothers forced to separate from their children in extreme circumstances are examined, with recommendations for treatment."}, {"Title": "The HCL-32: towards a self-assessment tool for hypomanic symptoms in outpatients.", "Abstract": "Bipolar disorders (BP) are frequently diagnosed and treated as pure depression initially; accurate diagnosis often being delayed by 8 to 10 years. In prospective studies, the presence of hypomanic symptoms in adolescence is strongly predictive of later bipolar disorders. As such, an instrument for self-assessment of hypomanic symptoms might increase the detection of suspected and of manifest, but under-treated, cases of bipolar disorders.\nThe multi-lingual hypomania checklist (HCL-32) has been developed and is being tested internationally. This preliminary paper reports the performance of the scale in distinguishing individuals with BP (N=266) from those with major depressive disorder (MDD; N=160). The samples were adult psychiatry patients recruited in Italy (N=186) and Sweden (N=240).\nThe samples reported similar clinical profiles and the structure for the HCL-32 demonstrated two main factors identified as \"active/elated\" hypomania and \"risk-taking/irritable\" hypomania. The HCL-32 distinguished between BP and MDD with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 51%.\nAlthough the HCL-32 is a sensitive instrument for hypomanic symptoms, it does not distinguish between BP-I and BP-II disorders.\nFuture studies should test if different combinations of items, possibly recording the consequences of hypomania, can distinguish between these BP subtypes."}, {"Title": "Prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar I disorder: review of diagnostic validation by Robins and Guze criteria.", "Abstract": "The phenomenology of pediatric bipolar disorder is a controversial topic in the field of child psychiatry. The first National Institute of Mental Health-funded study in the field, Phenomenology and Course of Pediatric Bipolar Disorders, selected a conservative phenotype for credibility in a contentious field. To address the problems of differentiation of mania from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and of the ubiquitous manifestation of irritability across child psychiatry diagnoses, a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar I disorder phenotype (PEA-BP) was defined by DSM-IV bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed phase) with elation and/or grandiosity as one criterion. This criterion avoided diagnosing mania by symptoms that overlapped with those of ADHD (e.g., hyperactivity, distractibility) and ensured that subjects had at least 1 of the cardinal symptoms of mania (i.e., elation or grandiosity). This definition was analogous to the requirement that DSM-IV major depressive disorder include at least 1 of the cardinal symptoms of depression (i.e., sad mood or anhedonia). Subjects were 93 children with a mean +/- SD age of 10.9 +/- 2.6 years. Validation of the phenotype was shown according to Robins and Guze criteria: unique symptoms that did not overlap with those of ADHD, stability of the diagnosis (did not become ADHD or other disorders on follow-up) as shown by a 4-year prospective longitudinal study, significantly higher familial aggregation of bipolar disorder in relatives of PEA-BP versus ADHD and healthy control probands, and family-based linkage disequilibrium of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66 allele in PEA-BP probands. Furthermore, PEA-BP resembled the most severe adult bipolar disorder, manifested by a chronic, ultradian-cycling, mixed manic, psychotic course. A conservatively defined child mania phenotype met the Robins and Guze criteria for establishing diagnostic validity in psychiatric illness. Continuities between PEA-BP and adult bipolar disorder and relationships of PEA-BP to other descriptions of child mania are discussed."}, {"Title": "Long-term course of adolescent schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Our study investigated premorbid functioning, course, and outcome in early-onset schizophrenia.

To assess premorbid adaptation and precursor symptoms, we administered the Instrument for the Retrospective Assessment of the Onset of Schizophrenia, which we modified to assess children and adolescents. Symptomatology was measured by the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. In addition, the Global Assessment of Functioning was applied. Followup data for 81 patients (80.2%) were available. The mean duration of schizophrenia at followup was 9.5 +/- 2.2 years. Assessment of the highest level of adaptive functioning revealed very good or good outcome in 19.8 percent of the patients, fair or poor outcome in 38.2 percent, and very poor outcome and gross impairment in 42.0 percent.

A number of neuropsychologic tests of executive function commonly are used in assessing several clinical disorders, including but not limited to traumatic brain injury, schizophrenia, depression, attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. Because the concept of executive control in its current form constitutes an over arching construct, a construct that is based on the cognitive symptoms of the frontal lobe disorder caused by many disparate underlying conditions, no single measure of executive function can adequately tap the construct in its entirety.Therefore, it is necessary to administer several tests of executive function,each assessing a particular aspect of the executive function. An appropriate combination of such neuropsychologic tests and batteries, including the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Tower test, Stroop test, the D-KEFS, and the ECB, provides an adequate but relatively crude mechanism for assessing executive systems dysfunction. Neuroscientists continue to refine their understanding of the nature of executive control, and additional innovative procedures that reflect state-of-the-art insights of cognitive neuroscience have been introduced recently.

Drug distribution can be imaged by MRS and this has shown brain lithium level to be about half the plasma level. PET and SPET studies have demonstrated that unlike the classical antipsychotics (e.g. chlorpromazine), atypical antipsychotic drugs such as risperidone and clozapine have high cortical serotonin (5HT2) receptor occupancy (80-90%), thus challenging the theory of a simple relationship between dopamine (D2) receptor occupancy (blocked by classical antipsychotics) and clinical efficacy.\nRadiological studies of psychiatric populations add to available knowledge on the biological aspects of psychiatry.

Among the interesting aspects connected with ECT we can mention patients' attitude and their psychic comfort. Since many patients undergoing ECT treat the situation as stressful, the research being done has been situated in a relational stress paradigm. The obtained results confirm the assumed direction of relations between cognitive appraisal of a situation and the experienced emotions. The way in which patients undergoing ECT perceive their situation substantially influences the level of their psychic comfort. Persons, who make the cognitive appraisal of a situations as a challenge, are much more efficient on the level of the experienced emotions than those who appraise a situation as a threat. It makes us pay particular attention to patients' beliefs connected with ECT. The adequate psychoeducational influence based upon creating a motivation for treatment, forming an ability of concentrating attention at positive aspects of a situation and possible benefits may contribute to the more positive reception of ECT and thus to increasing patients' psychic comfort during the treatment process."}, {"Title": "[Crisis Homes for adult psychiatric patients.

This may exert a vital corrective balance to the professionalization of health by ensuring that the individual perspective of patients is not neglected. There are many 'good ideas' for new treatments being published which have a plausible scientific rationale for effectiveness and a low likelihood of harm, yet are essentially ignored by mainstream medical research. The most likely avenue for progress is probably the spread of self-management, together with increased sharing of experience via the internet. There is considerable scope for self-management of psychiatric symptoms with psychoactive medication purchased 'over-the-counter' (OTC) and without prescription. A surprisingly wide range of effective psychoactive agents are available with the potential to self-treat many of the common psychiatric problems. These include 'medical' psychopharmacological agents such as analgesics and antihistamines, a plant extract called St. John's Wort (Hypericum), and physical treatments such as early morning bright light therapy. But self-management currently lacks an explicit therapeutic model. A three stage process of S-DTM - self-diagnosis, self-treatment and self-monitoring is proposed and described in relation to psychiatric symptoms. Self-diagnosis describes the skill of introspection to develop awareness of inner bodily states and emotions. A specific sensation is identified and isolated as the 'focal symptom' for subsequent treatment and monitoring. Self-treatment involves choosing a drug (or other therapy) which is intended to alleviate the focal symptom. Self-monitoring entails a continued awareness of the focal system and of general well-being in order to evaluate effect of therapy. Self-monitoring could involve repeated cycles of dose-adjustment, and on-off ('challenge-dechallenge-rechallenge') therapeutic trials. An example of S-DTM applied to psychiatry might include the attempt to alleviate the fatigue and malaise symptoms underlying a 'depressed' mood by using OTC analgesics such as aspirin, paracetamol/acetaminophen, ibuprofen or codeine. Anxiety symptoms might be self-managed either using an 'unofficial SSRI' (selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor) such as the antihistamines diphenhydramine or chlorpheniramine; or with St John's Wort/hypericum."}, {"Title": "Safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy.", "Abstract": "Women with epilepsy taking antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy have been shown to have an increased risk of having a child with a major malformation.

This abnormality may be present early in development, giving rise to dysfunction as an individual matures. The present studies examined the effects of early partial loss of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) DA on DA turnover and locomotor behavior in juvenile, pubertal, and adult rats (30, 45, and 60 days of age, respectively). Local infusions of 6-hydroxydopamine on postnatal day (PN) 12-14 produced persistent decreases in basal tissue DA concentrations and increases in 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC):DA ratios in the mPFC. In the nucleus accumbens of lesioned rats, basal DA concentrations were decreased and DOPAC:DA ratios were increased on PN30, but not PN45 or 60. Footshock (30 min at 0.6 mA) increased DOPAC and DOPAC:DA ratios in the mPFC of PN30 and 60 control rats. These effects were attenuated in age-matched rats previously sustaining approximately 50% loss of mPFC DA on PN12-14. Footshock did not affect DOPAC:DA ratios in the nucleus accumbens of control or lesioned rats. The lesion also failed to alter basal or stress-evoked motor activity. The present data suggest that a decreased density of mPFC DA nerve terminals occurring early in development results in persistent alterations in basal and stress-evoked activity of mesoprefrontal DA neurons, but not mesoaccumbens DA neurons."}, {"Title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation as a therapeutic tool in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a patient-friendly stimulation technique of the brain with interesting perspectives. In clinical psychiatry, limited data are available on activity in psychosis and anxiety, but much research has been done in depression. Major concerns on published papers are the inconsistency of used parameter settings, the restraint numbers of patients in randomised trials, the lack of real sham controlled studies and the quasi inexistent reproducibility of results. The most stringent meta-analysis of TMS in affective disorders found a modest, statistically significant antidepressant effect after 2 weeks of daily treatment of high frequency repetitive left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation. Although most results are rather weak and not convincing enough to promote TMS as evidence-based antidepressive therapy, they show a measurable action that should not be ignored. Preclinical and clinical effects were observed analysing heterogeneous data, and results comparing TMS to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in affective disorders are encouraging. Efforts should continue with emphasis on increasing homogeneity and reproducibility in data. Further refinement of stimulation parameters should be established, so that new and large double-blind, long-term, sham-controlled trials can bring us to better understanding and standardising TMS procedure, finally leading to definitive conclusions about its efficacy in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[The choice of a medical career in a population of 600 second-cycle French medical students preparing the national-ranking exam].", "Abstract": "To analyse the choice of career of a sample of second-cycle French medical students following the implementation of the recent national-ranking exam (NRE).\nAll the medical students registered in a cycle of conferences to prepare for the NRE filled-in a self-administered, anonymous, questionnaire in Paris and the provinces during the university year 2004.

Therefore we analysed the decision-making models used to establish the criteria for admission to child and adolescent psychiatric clinics. It is assumed that the clinical experience and social orientation of the specialists involved, as well as the standpoint of their respective institutions of health care, play a significant role.\nThe decision-making models of 71 specialists working in the field of in- and outpatient child and adolescent psychiatry were recorded using an adapted structuring process. The hypotheses were examined by comparing the models used by the different professional groups working in inpatient units and by child and adolescent psychiatrists working in private practice to the decision-making models used by assistant medical directors and head physicians.\nThe factors \"clinical experience\" and \"profession group orientation\" were found to be of only marginal importance. Only the inpatient nursing staff considered social factors in arriving at an indication. The influence of such \"setting\" variables is also evident in the fact that the outpatient staff used more narrowly defined criteria and rated their outpatient service as being more sustainable than did the physicians in the inpatient departments. The criteria used by all professions included being a danger to oneself and others, severity of symptoms, the assessment of outpatient resources and efficiency, prospects of success, and the need for intensive treatment.\nThe results of this study provide a basis for further research and indicate the need for additional discussion of the indication criteria currently in use."}, {"Title": "[Can a specific assessment of attention contribute to the differential diagnostics of psychiatric disorders?].", "Abstract": "The present study examined whether or not children and adolescents with clinical symptoms can be differentiated according to the quantitative and qualitative aspects of attention.\nEighty-eight probands (ages 10-18 years) assigned to seven ICD-10 diagnostic groups were studied for differences in their attention profiles. An attention task (Frankfurter Aufmerksamkeits Inventar--FAIR), (Moosbrugger & Oehlschl\u00e4gel, 1996) validated multifold among children and adolescents in the domain of psychiatry was applied. This task covers three attention functions. Two of them are quantitative: selective attention and continuity of attention, while the third is qualitative: self-control.\nOverall, two distinctly different group-specific attention profiles evolved. These differed mainly in terms of self-control. Whereas all of the diagnostic groups studied showed relatively normal selective attention and normal continuity of attention, two groups exhibited substantial differences with regard to self-control. Particularly children and adolescents with schizophrenia showed very poor self-control, as did those with hyperkinetic disorder, conduct disorder, depressive disorder, or compulsive disorder. In contrast, children and adolescents with eating disorders or other anxiety disorders had a high level of self-control.\nThus, the self-control function was found to be a strong attention parameter for the differential diagnosis of a clinically conspicuous population of children and adolescents."}, {"Title": "[Aatypical antipsychotics in child and adolescent psychiatry--indications apart from schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "Given their special receptor profile, atypical antipsychotics are effective in the treatment of both positive and negative symptoms.

To further investigate the mechanisms of response inhibition, this paradigm was applied to 11 healthy young adults. To better distinguish response-inhibition-related activity from early attentional effects, a \"Stop-Signal-Irrelevant\" condition was added, in which subjects performed the task while ignoring the Stop Signals. In the Stop-Signal-Relevant condition, the right frontal N200 to the Stop Signals was larger for Successful inhibition (SI) than for Failed inhibition (FI) trials. The timing and distribution of this effect was strikingly similar to that of the right-frontal ADHD deficit reported in Pliszka et al. (2000), supporting this activity being related to successful normal inhibitory control processes. In contrast, a posterior N200 was larger for Stop-Relevant than for Stop-Irrelevant trials, likely reflecting enhanced early sensory attention to the Stop Signals when relevant. Two longer-latency failure-specific ERP effects were also observed: a greater frontopolar negative wave (370-450 ms) to Failed than Successful inhibitions, and a greater parietal positive slow wave (450-650 ms) for Failed inhibitions than ignore-stop trials, likely reflecting differential recruitment of error detection and correction mechanisms following Failed attempts to inhibit a response."}, {"Title": "[Origin of psychiatric disorders ex sexualibus: explanatory approaches at the beginning of the 19th century].", "Abstract": "In the first half of the 19th century there were the first publications, which dealt systematically with the relation between deviations of the sexual system or behaviour and mental disturbances.

A sample of 95 relatives was assessed at admission and after four weeks of treatment using the Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire (IEQ) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), the period to be rated being the last four weeks prior to assessment.\nRelatives reported a mean level of burden, which for both settings decreased during the first four weeks of treatment. With respect to this period, burden on relatives of day hospital patients did not differ from that on relatives of inpatients. The relatives' mental well-being was markedly impaired, and only that of the inpatients' relatives did slightly improve during treatment.\nTreating acute mentally ill as day hospital patients does not result in greater burden on relatives compared to treating them as inpatients.

(DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria generally discourage the diagnosis of other Axis I disorders in children with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), anxiety symptoms are often observed in this clinical population. Moreover, there are some albeit limited data that suggest an association between anxiety and psychotic symptoms in children. Because co-occurring psychiatric symptoms have important clinical implications, this study examined anxiety and psychotic symptoms in children with and without PDD.\nParents and teachers completed the Early Childhood Inventory-4 (ECI-4) or the Child Symptom Inventory (CSI-4) for children evaluated in a developmental disabilities clinic (PDD) or a child psychiatry outpatient clinic (non-PDD). Children were divided into four groups: 3-5- year-olds with (n = 182) and without (n = 135) PDD, and 6-12-year-olds with (n = 301) and without (n = 191) PDD. The 6-12-year-olds were further divided into high-anxious and low-anxious subgroups based on CSI-4 ratings and compared with regard to severity of psychotic symptoms.\nTeachers rated preschoolers with PDD as exhibiting more severe anxiety symptoms than the non-PDD group; however, the converse was true for parent ratings. For 6-12- year-olds, both parents and teachers rated children with PDD as significantly more anxious than non-PDD clinic referrals. In general, the severity of anxiety symptoms varied by PDD subtype (Asperger's disorder > PDDNOS > Autistic disorder) and IQ (high > low). Furthermore, highly anxious 6-12-year-olds with PDD received significantly higher parent and teacher ratings of psychotic symptom severity (strange behaviors, hearing voices, illogical thinking, inappropriate affect, and odd thoughts) than our low-anxious group, even when controlling for PDD symptom severity. Moreover, the relation between anxiety level and psychotic symptom severity was similar for both PDD and non-PDD children. Parent and teachers differed in their perceptions of the severity of specific anxiety symptoms. In addition, parent- versus teacher-defined anxiety level groups varied with regard to the differential severity of psychotic symptoms. This finding highlights the importance of continued investigation of source-specific syndromes in children with PDD. Two case vignettes are presented.\nAnxiety appears to be a clinically important concern in many children with PDD. Similarities in anxiety symptom presentation and their association with psychotic symptoms in both children with and without PDD support the possibility of: (1) psychiatric comorbidity in the former; (2) at least some overlap in causal mechanisms for anxiety and psychotic symptoms in both PDD and non-PDD children; and (3) a unique diagnostic entity comprised of PDD, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms. Lastly, clinicians should seriously consider dual diagnoses in children with PDD."}, {"Title": "A study of reasons of non-compliance to psychiatric treatment.", "Abstract": "This study was carried out with an objective to find out the frequency of different reasons of non-compliance to treatment in a sample of out door psychiatric patients.\nThis study was conducted at Psychiatry department, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad, from Aug. 2001 to Jan. 2002.

The percentage of the general population who reported at least one need for care ranged from 9.5% to 13.8%. The numbers of needs in psychiatric patients ranged from 3.3 to 8.6. Correlates of unmet need include: unemployment, single status, low quality of life and high disability scores, and the presence of certain psychiatric diagnoses, such as affective psychosis and personality disorders. Higher rates of met need and service satisfaction are correlated with a longer duration of service contact.\nThe assessment of need to date has been established either by service use data to make inferences about unmet need, by asking limited guided questions about needs, or by using established needs assessment instruments.

The relevant epidemiological studies were identified on the basis of the Medline data bank, starting with the year 1966. The evaluation of occupational groups with an elevated tuberculosis risk is exclusively based on epidemiologic studies of good or acceptable quality, applying clearly defined criteria of methodological quality. In summary, the available epidemiological evidence suggests that the risk of tuberculosis is elevated in the following occupational groups: hospital employees in wards with tuberculosis patients; nurses in hospitals; nurses attending HIV-positive or drug-addicted patients; pathology and laboratory workers; respiratory therapists and physiotherapists; physicians in internal medicine, anaesthesia, surgery and psychiatry; non-medical hospital personnel in housekeeping and transport work; funeral home employees, and prison employees. However, the epidemiological evidence is limited for all these occupations, with the exception of the nurses, because of the lack of methodologically adequate studies that have got the statistical power to differentiate between specific work tasks. There is a need for large population-based studies with precise definition of exposure, which should include molecular epidemiologic methods in the investigation of occupational risk factors of tuberculosis."}, {"Title": "Prevalence of dementia among Veterans Affairs medical care system users.", "Abstract": "In an aging population, the number of veterans diagnosed with dementia is likely to increase.

Veterans were included if they had one of the following dementia ICD-9 codes: 290.XX, 291.2, 294.XX, 331.XX, 046.1, or 046.3.\nThe overall prevalence of dementia was 7.3%. The prevalence of dementia was similar among white patients and patients of other races, except African-American patients, in whom it was 50% higher. Across VISNs, the prevalence of dementia ranged from 5.8 to 9.4%. Alzheimer's disease was the most frequently diagnosed type of dementia within the VA, and inpatient service utilization and outpatient psychiatry visits by individuals with dementia were high relative to other VA patients.\nThe overall prevalence identified is consistent with that reported in the literature, as is the elevated prevalence in African-Americans versus whites.

Patients referred for evaluation of dementia were excluded. The specific indications leading clinicians to obtain MRI were identified and grouped. In order to offset the uncertain significance of many MRI findings, for this study, the predictive value of each indication was calculated based on the percentage of patients in whom clinical management changed in response to MRI findings rather than on the percentage with any abnormal MRI results.\nOf 253 patients who had MRIs, 38 (15%) incurred some degree of treatment modification as a result of MRI findings, including 6 patients in whom MRI identified a medical condition that became the focus of treatment. Six indications appeared most likely to prompt clinicians to obtain MRIs. Because pertinent results were associated with each of these indications, statistical evaluation did not reveal significant differences in their predictive values (chi(2) = 4.32, df = 5, p = .505).\nUnlike prior studies showing no value to screening radioimaging, this study shows MRI can be a useful screening test among patients suspected of having organic psychiatric disorders and that the common indications for MRI employed at one institution were predictive."}, {"Title": "Flashback: psychiatric experimentation with LSD in historical perspective.", "Abstract": "In the popular mind, d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) research in psychiatry has long been associated with the CIA-funded experiments conducted by Ewen Cameron at the Allen Memorial Institute in Montreal, Quebec. Despite this reputation, a host of medical researchers in the post World War II era explored LSD for its potential therapeutic value. Some of the most widespread trials in the Western world occurred in Saskatchewan, under the direction of psychiatrists Humphry Osmond (in Weyburn) and Abram Hoffer (in Saskatoon). These medical researchers were first drawn to LSD because of its ability to produce a \"model psychosis.\" Their experiments with the drug that Osmond was to famously describe as a \"psychedelic\" led them to hypothesize and promote the biochemical nature of schizophrenia. This brief paper examines the early trials in Saskatchewan, drawing on hospital records, interviews with former research subjects, and the private papers of Hoffer and Osmond. It demonstrates that, far from being fringe medical research, these LSD trials represented a fruitful, and indeed encouraging, branch of psychiatric research occurring alongside more famous and successful trials of the first generation of psychopharmacological agents, such as chlropromazine and imipramine. Ultimately, these LSD experiments failed for 2 reasons, one scientific and the other cultural. First, in the 1950s and early 1960s, the scientific parameters of clinical trials shifted to necessitate randomized controlled trials, which the Saskatchewan researchers had failed to construct. Second, as LSD became increasingly associated with student riots, antiwar demonstrations, and the counterculture, governments intervened to criminalize the drug, restricting and then terminating formal medical research into its potential therapeutic effects."}, {"Title": "Listening to the past: history, psychiatry, and anxiety.", "Abstract": "This article explores the history of psychiatry and the rise of biological psychiatry and suggests ways in which the study of history can shed light on current psychiatric practice and debate.

Psychiatric assessment was performed by experienced liaison psychiatrists and ICD10 diagnosis and treatment programme assigned. Subjects completed HADS at presentation and follow-up. Asthma was managed according to BTS/SIGN Guidelines.\nOf 65 subjects who attended for psychiatric interview, 32 (49%) had an ICD10 diagnosis, (6 (9%) previously identified) with depression most common (59%). Physician assessment had poor discrimination for psychiatric illness. Anxiety scores (13.4+/-0.8 vs. 8.5+/-0.7) and depression scores (10.2+/-0.7 vs. 4.8+/-0.5) scores were significantly higher in subjects with ICD10 diagnosis (P<0.001), who were also more likely to be current smokers (P<0.01). HADS had a poor positive predictive value for psychiatric illness but a good negative predictive value for depression. There was no relationship between ICD10 diagnosis and asthma outcome. Subjects identified as therapy-resistant asthma after systematic evaluation, had significantly lower depression scores after treatment (P<0.05).\nIn difficult asthmatics, there is a high prevalence of undiagnosed psychiatric morbidity, with depression being particularly prevalent.

Specifically, the 10-repeat allele of the 40-bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the gene has been found to be associated with ADHD. There is evidence from in vitro studies indicating that variability in the repeat number, and sequence variation in the 3'-UTR of the DAT1 gene may influence the level of the dopamine transporter protein [Fuke et al. (2001): Pharmacogenomics J 1(2):152-156; Miller and Madras (2002): Mol Psychiatry 7(1):44-55]. In this study, we investigated whether DNA variation in the DAT1 3'UTR contributed to ADHD by genotyping DNA variants around the VNTR region in a sample of 178 ADHD families. These included a MspI polymorphism (rs27072), a DraI DNA change (T/C) reported to influence DAT1 expression levels, and a BstUI polymorphism (rs3863145) in addition to the VNTR. We also screened the VNTR region by direct resequencing to determine if there was sequence variation within the repeat units that could account for the association. Our results indicate that DAT1 is associated with ADHD in our sample but not with alleles of the VNTR polymorphism. We did not find any variation in the sequence for either the 10- or 9-repeat alleles in the probands screened nor did we observe the reported DraI (T/C) variation. Our results therefore refute the possibility of the reported DraI variation or alleles of the VNTR as the functional variants contributing to the disorder."}, {"Title": "Fibromyalgia syndrome: review of clinical presentation, pathogenesis, outcome measures, and treatment.", "Abstract": "Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is a common chronic pain condition that affects at least 2% of the adult population in the USA and other regions in the world where FM is studied. Prevalence rates in some regions have not been ascertained and may be influenced by differences in cultural norms regarding the definition and attribution of chronic pain states. Chronic, widespread pain is the defining feature of FM, but patients may also exhibit a range of other symptoms, including sleep disturbance, fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, headache, and mood disorders. Although the etiology of FM is not completely understood, the syndrome is thought to arise from influencing factors such as stress, medical illness, and a variety of pain conditions in some, but not all patients, in conjunction with a variety of neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine disturbances. These include reduced levels of biogenic amines, increased concentrations of excitatory neurotransmitters, including substance P, and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. A unifying hypothesis is that FM results from sensitization of the central nervous system. Establishing diagnosis and evaluating effects of therapy in patients with FM may be difficult because of the multifaceted nature of the syndrome and overlap with other chronically painful conditions. Diagnostic criteria, originally developed for research purposes, have aided our understanding of this patient population in both research and clinical settings, but need further refinement as our knowledge about chronic widespread pain evolves. Outcome measures, borrowed from clinical research in pain, rheumatology, neurology, and psychiatry, are able to distinguish treatment response in specific symptom domains. Further work is necessary to validate these measures in FM. In addition, work is under way to develop composite response criteria, intended to address the multidimensional nature of this syndrome. A range of medical treatments, including antidepressants, opioids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, sedatives, muscle relaxants, and antiepileptics, have been used to treat FM. Nonpharmaceutical treatment modalities, including exercise, physical therapy, massage, acupuncture, and cognitive behavioral therapy, can be helpful. Few of these approaches have been demonstrated to have clear-cut benefits in randomized controlled trials. However, there is now increased interest as more effective treatments are developed and our ability to accurately measure effect of treatment has improved. The multifaceted nature of FM suggests that multimodal individualized treatment programs may be necessary to achieve optimal outcomes in patients with this syndrome."}, {"Title": "[Clinical features, biology and neuropsychology of the autistic disorder: towards an integrative perspective].", "Abstract": "Autism constitutes one of the most investigated disorders in child psychiatry.

The principle clinical applications apply to a particular group of specialties: cardiology, neurology, psychiatry, and above all oncology. Positron emission tomography is a non-invasive diagnostic imaging technique with clinical applications. It is an excellent tool for the study of the stage and possible malignancy of tumors of head and neck, the detection of otherwise clinically indeterminate metastases and lymphadenopathies, and likewise for the diagnosis of relapses. The only tracer with any practical clinical application is fluor-desoxyglucosa-F18 (FDG). PET detects the intense accumulation of FDG produced in malignant tumors due to the increased glycolytic rate of the neoplastic cells. With the introduction of hybrid systems that combine computerized tomography or magnetic resonance with positron emission tomography, important advances are being made in the diagnosis and follow-up of oncologic pathology of head and neck."}, {"Title": "Meta-review of high-quality systematic reviews of interventions in key areas of liaison psychiatry.", "Abstract": "When planning and delivering a liaison psychiatry service it is important to have an understanding of the research evidence supporting the use of interventions likely to be delivered by the service.\nTo identify high-quality systematic reviews for all interventions in three defined areas of liaison psychiatry, to summarise their clinical implications and to highlight areas where more research is needed.

There is growing evidence that earlier and sustained intervention improves at least short-term outcomes. However, early intervention may be iatrogenic where systems of care are poor in quality.

In order to trace both their reflection of and influence on each other, this paper seeks to rupture the alliance of these terms with their clinical 'pseudonyms' of mental illness and creativity. Drawing on preceding psychiatric research, as well as both literary criticism and anthropological theory, this paper traces the patchwork of metaphors and cultural imaginings that make up the genius/madness myth-the socio-cultural construction of genius through madness. With particular focus on the cyclical processes of cultural mythmaking it tracks the elements of this construction, initially diachronically, and then through psychiatry and its effect on social thought. Finally, an assessment of the social implications of this myth illustrates that not only is genius socio-culturally constructed through madness but that madness itself is also fabricated through genius in the binding circularity of societal mythmaking. The paper argues that this socio-cultural construction legitimates and elevates, shackles and constrains, having societal implications far beyond the reaches of its own confines."}, {"Title": "[Not Available].", "Abstract": "A Primary Care Program in old age psychiatry: Background, implementation and first experiences.

Rodgers' evolutionary method of concept analysis served as the framework for reviewing literature from psychology/psychiatry, general medicine, and nursing. Attributes of symptom clusters were relationships of symptoms and relationships of clusters, concurrence, underlying dimensions, stability, and common etiology. The major antecedent was the presence of 2 or more symptoms. Consequences were poorer physical health status, interference with activities of daily living, emotional distress, and increased financial burden. A symptom cluster is defined as consisting of 2 or more symptoms that are related to each other and that occur together. Symptom clusters are composed of stable groups of symptoms, are relatively independent of other clusters, and may reveal specific underlying dimensions of symptoms. Relationships among symptoms within a cluster should be stronger than relationships among symptoms across different clusters. Symptoms in a cluster may or may not share the same etiology. Symptom should be broadened to include both subjective (self-reported) symptoms and objective (observed) signs. Implications for researchers include the need to use a clear definition, determine the optimal methods of identifying etiology and nature of symptom clusters in various populations, assess the clinical utility of symptom clusters, and test interventions. Implications for practitioners include the need to comprehensively assess symptoms over the entire cancer trajectory, select interventions that target single and multiple symptoms, and evaluate outcomes that include quality of life and economic variables."}, {"Title": "Perceptions of the impact of depression and anxiety and the medication for these conditions on safety in the workplace.", "Abstract": "The number of people taking prescribed medication for anxiety and depression has increased greatly, but little is known of how this medication impacts on safety at work.\nTo examine the relation between anxiety and depression, prescribed medication, performance, and safety in the workplace.\nThe research involved nine focus groups with sufferers of anxiety and depression to investigate experiences of mental health problems and the impact of psychotropic drugs.

As many of these patients have commonly been through traumatic experiences, psychoanalysts have been using an approach that questions the role of traditional psychoanalytical interpretation and pays more attention to the patient's inner conscious experiences; this approach is characteristic of a specific form of contemporary psychiatry: phenomenological psychopathology, founded by Karl Jaspers in 1913 and developed into a form of psychotherapy by Ludwig Binswanger, with his Daseinsanalyse. If what we could call a phenomenological 'temptation' has been spreading over psychoanalysis, so too has a psychoanalytical 'temptation' always been present in phenomenological psychopathology. In fact, even though this branch of psychiatry has led us towards a deeper understanding of the characteristics of psychotic being-in-the-world, its therapeutic applications have never been adequately formalised, much less have they evolved into a specific technique or a structured psychotherapeutic approach. Likewise, phenomenological psychotherapy has always held an anaclitic attitude towards psychoanalysis, accepting its procedures but refusing its theoretical basis because it is too close to that of the objectifying natural sciences. Psychoanalytic 'temptation' and phenomenological 'temptation' can thus be considered as two sides of the same coin and outline a trend in psychoanalytic and phenomenological literature which points out the fundamental role of the patient's inner conscious experiences in the treatment of borderline and psychotic patients."}, {"Title": "[Advances in molecular genetics of schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia (MIM 181500) is a complex disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population worldwide.

However, aetiopathological explanations for psychiatric disorders are no longer closely related to acute infection. Nevertheless, immune hypotheses have been discussed in schizophrenia, affective disorders and infantile autism in the last decades. Although the variability between the results of the epidemiological studies conducted to date is strikingly high, there is still some evidence that the immune system might play a role in the aetiopathogenesis of these three psychiatric diseases, at least in subgroups of patients. In anxiety disorders immunological research is still very much in its infancy, and the few and inconsistent data of immune changes in these patients are believed to reflect the influence of short- or long-term stress exposure. Nevertheless, there are also some hints raising the possibility that autoimmune mechanisms could interrupt neurotransmission, which would be of significance in certain patients with anxiety and panic disorders. Drug and alcohol (ethanol) dependence are not believed to be primarily influenced by an immunological aetiology. On the other hand, immune reactions due to different drugs of abuse and alcohol may directly or indirectly influence the course of concomitant somatic diseases. In different organic brain disorders the underlying somatic disease is defined as a primary immune or autoimmune disorder, for instance HIV infection or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). For other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, immunoaetiopathological mechanisms are supported by experimental and clinical studies. Treatment strategies based on immune mechanisms have been investigated in patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders. Furthermore, some antipsychotics and most antidepressants are known to have direct or indirect effects on the immune system. Different immunotherapies have been used in autism, including transfer factor, pentoxifylline, intravenous immunoglobulins and corticosteroids. Immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulating agents are well established methods for treating the neuropsychiatric sequelae of immune or autoimmune disorders, for example AIDS and SLE. Therapeutic approaches in Alzheimer's disease also apply immunological methods such as strategies of active/passive immunisation and NSAIDs. Considering the comprehensive interactive network between mind and body, future research should focus on approaches linking targets of the different involved systems."}, {"Title": "[Absences as differential diagnosis in children with attention-deficit disorder].", "Abstract": "Absences are regarded as one of the most important differential diagnosis of attention and resulting school-problems.

After critically analyzing this idea of autonomy in the context of various forms of self-commitment and pre-commitment, we argue that what is at stake in using Ulysses contracts in psychiatry is not autonomy as sovereignty, but autonomy as authenticity.

Impairments associated with adult ADHD include distress from the symptoms, impaired ability to function in work and academic settings, and problems sustaining stable relationships. The disorder is commonly associated with volatile moods, antisocial behavior, and drug and alcohol misuse. There is an increased risk of developing comorbid anxiety, depression, personality disorders, and drug and alcohol dependence. Despite the proven effectiveness of drugs such as methylphenidate, dexamphetamine and atomoxetine, few cases of ADHD are recognized and treated in the UK. The reasons for this are unclear, since most psychiatrists working with children and adolescents are aware that ADHD commonly persists into adult life and they also see the disorder affecting parents of children with ADHD. Issues of transition from the care of child to adult psychiatry and the need to refer adult relatives of children with ADHD to suitable psychiatric services are a major concern. Furthermore, many cases of adult ADHD go unrecognized or are seen by mental health teams that are not familiar with the subtleties of the adult presentation. As a result, misdiagnosis and treatment for conditions such as atypical depression, mixed affective disorder, cyclothymia, and borderline and unstable emotional personality disorders is not uncommon. There is therefore a requirement for further training in this area. This review will describe the common clinical presentation and provide guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in adults. Any psychiatrically trained physician using standard psychiatric assessment procedures can perform clinical evaluations for adult ADHD. As with other psychiatric disorders in adulthood, ADHD has its own characteristic onset, course and psychopathology. Symptoms of ADHD are trait-like, being stable characteristics from early childhood, and commonly co-occur with affective instability. Stimulants are the mainstay of treatment and are effective in around 70% of cases. Psychotherapeutic interventions also have an important role. These guidelines will assist psychiatrists and other adult mental health workers in identifying and treating individuals with adult ADHD."}, {"Title": "Improving health centre physicians' child-psychiatric networks.", "Abstract": "To study changes in Finnish GPs' child-psychiatric networks over a one-year period.\nPostal questionnaire.\nHealth centres in the area of Tampere University Hospital with a catchment population of one million.\nA one-off course in the field of child psychiatry was held 56 times in different health centres.\nGPs (n = 761) working in the area received a questionnaire in 2000 and 2001.

Misunderstanding and ineffective treatment are often based on different explanations of suicide held by patients, their families, and health professionals, even when they share culture and language. In this report we describe how suicide is perceived by psychiatric team members in one regional teaching hospital in northern Taiwan. Twenty-two staff members of the Department of Psychiatry participated in this study. \"Making a diagnosis\" characterized the psychiatric subculture around the care of suicidal patients. In addition, mental health professionals tended to differentiate the patient's condition through three main avenues: (a) psychotic symptoms versus personality problems, (b) low IQ and high educational level, and (c) high versus low lethality of method. These findings suggest that mental health professionals need to bridge the gap between their knowledge and understanding of suicide and patients' and patients' families' expectations for care and treatment."}, {"Title": "Manic-depressive illness: evolution in Kraepelin's Textbook, 1883-1926.", "Abstract": "The syndrome of manic-depressive insanity (MDI), as conceptualized by Emil Kraepelin a century ago, with later refinements, continues to dominate research and clinical practice with mood disorder patients. Current understanding of Kraepelin's views by Anglophones is heavily influenced by the late, highly developed, MDI concept represented in the 1921 partial English translation of the last complete edition of his textbook, the product of gradual development over several decades.\nWe reviewed all nine editions and revisions of Kraepelin's Textbook (1883-1926) and other writings by him to document the evolution of his views of MDI, and characterized salient developments within biographical and historical contexts.\nWe found support for the traditional impression that Kraepelin's clinical perception of similarities of various forms of periodic psychiatric disorders marked by fundamental dysregulation of excitation and inhibition of thought and behavior, as well as of mood--as distinct from chronic psychotic illnesses--encouraged his broad, mature concept of MDI. However, our findings indicate a complex evolution of Kraepelin's MDI concept in the 1880s and 1890s, his use of more creative and less empirical clinical methods than traditionally believed, and his considerable personal uncertainty about making clear distinctions among MDI, dementia praecox, intermediate conditions, and paranoid disorders--an uncertainty that persisted to the end of his career in the 1920s.\nKraepelin responded to a compelling international need for diagnostic order in nineteenth-century psychiatry, and effectively promoted his diagnostic proposals with a widely used and influential textbook. Though his methods were less empirical than is usually realized, his legacy includes analysis of large clinical samples to describe psychopathology and illness-course, along with efforts to define psychobiologically coherent and clinically differentiable entities, as steps toward defining psychiatric syndromes. Modern international \"neo-Kraepelinian\" enthusiasm for descriptive, criterion-based diagnosis should be tempered by Kraepelin's own appreciation of the tentative and uncertain nature of psychiatric nosology, particularly in classifying illnesses with both affective and psychotic features."}, {"Title": "Social capital and psychiatry: review of the literature.", "Abstract": "Social capital is an umbrella term used to describe aspects of social networks, relations, trust, and power, as a function of either the individual or a geographical entity (e.g., a city neighborhood). Increased attention is being paid to the role that social capital can play in determining a variety of physical health outcomes, though less attention has been paid to its role in determining mental health outcomes. This relative inattention continues despite a long historical tradition in psychiatry of exploring the role that socio-environmental factors can play in the etiology and course of mental illness. In this review, we begin by tracing the historical development of the concept of social capital, describing and analyzing competing definitions. We then proceed to review the published studies that examine the relationship between social capital and mental health-looking first at studies that focus on depression and anxiety, and second at studies that focus on psychoses. After briefly exploring whether social capital can have a detrimental effect on mental health, we discuss how knowledge regarding social capital may aid the clinician and mental health services. We go on to make a number of suggestions relevant to methodological, theoretical, and empirical advancement. These suggestions include refining the definitions of social capital, paying attention to communities without propinquity, and constructing contextual indicators of social capital. We conclude by remarking that social capital may be a promising heuristic for studies in community psychiatry and may even help individual clinicians in designing treatment plans. Despite all this promise, however, there is a lack of strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that social capital protects mental health."}, {"Title": "Musculoskeletal complaints among a group of Turkish nurses.", "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence and distribution of symptoms of musculoskeletal complaints among Turkish nurses who are practicing general nursing. The study population consisted of 120 nursing staff from four large general hospitals in Erzurum, Turkey. In every hospital six departments (surgery, medical, obstetric and gynecology, psychiatry, pediatric, and neurology) were selected. A Nordic standardized questionnaire described by Kuorinka et al. (1987) about complaints of the musculoskeletal system and a self-administered questionnaire involved information on the respondent's job and employment history, individual characteristics, physical and psychosocial risk factors at work, and general health status, were used by the researchers. Test data were analyzed for the difference between two population proportion and percentage. In the total population, 90% of all nurses reported at least one musculoskeletal complaint, 60% reported at least two, and 36% reported spells of three complaints in the past 6 months. Low back complaints were the most prevalent of musculoskeletal complaints, reported by 69% of the nurses. Neck complaints were less prevalent than shoulder (46% and 54%, respectively). Nurses with back complaint more often reported neck (28%) and shoulder (34%) complaints. Chronic low back, neck, and shoulder complaints were experienced by 41%, 25%, and 33% nurses, respectively. On the other hand, chronic complaints showed a correlation with working departments. The nurses working in surgery and obstetric and gynecology departments have more chronic complaints than the nurses working in other department (p<.05). The article's findings do not differ from those of other countries. Despite its limitations, this study points to the importance of perceived worked-related physical demands in relation to reported neck, shoulder, and back musculoskeletal complaints in Turkish nurses.

Several reviews on the topic have come to opposite conclusions, i.e., that BPD is a bipolar spectrum disorder or instead that it is unrelated to bipolar disorders. Study aim was to find which items of BPD were related to BP-II, and which instead had no relationship with BP-II.\nAn outpatient psychiatry private practice, more representative of mood disorders usually seen in clinical practice in Italy. INTERVIEWER: A senior clinical and mood disorder research psychiatrist.\nA consecutive sample of 138 BP-II and 71 major depressive disorder (MDD) remitted outpatients. ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS: The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders-Clinician Version (SCID-CV) was used for diagnosing, the SCID-II Personality Questionnaire was used by patients to self-assess borderline personality traits. Interview methods: Patients were interviewed with the SCID-CV to diagnose BP-II and MDD. The questions of the Personality Questionnaire relative to borderline personality were self-assessed by patients. As clinically significant distress or impairment of functioning was not assessed by the questionnaire, a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder could not be made, but borderline personality traits (BPT) could be assessed (i.e., all DSM-IV BPD items but not the impairment criterion).\nBPT items were significantly more common in BP-II versus MDD. The best combination of sensitivity and specificity for predicting BP-II was found by using a cutoff number of BPT items > or =5: specificity was 71.4%, sensitivity was 45.9%. BPT (defined by > or =5 items) was present in 29.5% of MDD and in 46.3% of BP-II (p=0.019). Logistic regression of BP-II versus BPT items number found a significant association. Principal component factor analysis of BPT items found two orthogonal factors: \"affective instability\" including unstable mood, unstable interpersonal relationships, unstable self-image, chronic emptiness, and anger, and \"impulsivity\" including impulsivity, suicidal behavior, avoidance of abandonment, and paranoid ideation. \"Affective instability\" was associated with BP-II (p=0.010), but \"impulsivity\" was not associated with BP-II (p=0.193). Interitem correlation was low. There was no significant correlation between the two factors.\nStudy findings suggest that DSM-IV BPD may mix two sets of unrelated items: an affective instability dimension related to BP-II, and an impulsivity dimension not related to BP-II, which may explain the opposite conclusions of several reviews. A subtyping of BPD according to these dimensions is supported by the study findings."}, {"Title": "A discussion on the role of clinimetrics and the misleading effects of psychometric theory.", "Abstract": "Psychometric theory is the basis for the development of assessment instruments in psychiatric research.\nIt has produced a number of variable methods for improving the validity and reliability of clinical assessment.

Demographic data were collected from medical records, and body mass index (BMI) and body fat measurements were conducted. Diagnosis of diabetes was established through review of medical records and fasting blood glucose testing. Associations between clinical and demographic variables and diabetes were examined using t tests, Fisher exact tests, and logistic regression.\nMean (SD) age of patients was 40.4 (9.5) years, and 79% were white. Mean (SD) dose and duration of clozapine treatment were 426 (164) mg/day and 5.7 (3.6) years, respectively. Point prevalence of diabetes was 25.7%. Mean (SD) BMI was 32.6 (8.0) kg/m(2), and mean (SD) body fat was 34.0% (11.0%). Logistic regression revealed significant associations between diabetes and nonwhite race/ethnicity and family history of diabetes (p = .02 and .002, respectively). No significant associations were found between diabetes prevalence and BMI or body fat.\nPatients receiving clozapine are at substantial risk for developing diabetes, although the level of risk relative to other antipsychotic medications has not been fully determined.

In the first, neurologist Foster Kennedy argued that 'feebleminded' people should be killed (an act which he referred to as 'euthanasia'). The rebuttal was written by psychiatrist Leo Kanner, who argued against 'euthanasia'. An unsigned editorial discussing these positions clearly sided with Kennedy: that 'euthanasia' would be appropriate in some cases, and that parents' opposition to this procedure should be the subject of psychiatric concern. The arguments are analysed and discussed within the context of eugenics and the murder of mental patients in Germany. Finally, the author points out that currently ascendant genetic theories in psychiatry could be a precursor for future proposals similar to Kennedy's."}, {"Title": "Some origins of cross-cultural psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The interface between insanity, race and culture was a challenging subject for some of the most influential nineteenth-century alienists. Our paper reviews some of the theoretical and clinical investigations of comparative psychiatry of this period. The idea that insanity was supposedly rare among 'primitive' people, e.g., Africans, American Natives and some Eastern populations, was repeatedly defended by prominent alienists. Associated with this notion, many authors believed that insanity tends to become more prevalent as civilization evolves. According to them, civilization had an unfavourable effect on insanity rates because it demanded a much higher degree of organization and mental production. Moreover, a greater degree of mental excitation would explain why insanity occurs more frequently in Europe than in the East, Africa or South America. Eventually, at the end of the nineteenth century, the coalition of cross-cultural and neuropsychiatry produced a notion that the brain of the 'native' is more simple and crude than that of the civilized, and more vulnerable to the evil effects of civilized life. In conclusion, some ethnocentric bias and racial stereotypes still pervasive in contemporary psychiatry are identified and traced back to their historical origins."}, {"Title": "Race, culture and psychiatry: a history of transcultural psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The term 'transcultural psychiatry' has encompassed changing notions of race, culture and psychiatry and, as a result, it is a difficult concept to define.

Surprisingly, ECT is most commonly not used as continuation therapy after acute remission. With rare exceptions, antidepressive medication is chosen for this purpose. The use of continuation ECT (cECT) and subsequent maintenance ECT (mECT) is not or just marginally mentioned in practice guidelines. In this article, we suggest guidelines for cECT, taking therapy recommendations and recent studies into account. Particularly, indication, management, comedication and comorbidity, side effects, and costs are examined. Today, cECT is underindicated as a result of assumed problems, fears, and stigmas. We would therefore recommend broader use of this proven treatment tool for keeping major depression in remission."}, {"Title": "Drug interactions between lamotrigine and psychoactive drugs: evidence from a therapeutic drug monitoring service.", "Abstract": "We present a systematic study on the interaction potential of lamotrigine, with focus on psychoactive drugs. A review of routine serum concentration measurements of lamotrigine performed in our laboratory yielded a total of 1733 serum samples from 829 patients (530 women, 299 men) suitable for statistical analysis. Main results for the whole study population were (median; interquartile range in parentheses): dose, 200 (100-300) mg; serum concentration, 2.97 (1.82-4.74) microg/mL; Lamotrigine serum concentration-to-dose ratio (LTG-CDR), 14.8 (9.9-24.6) (ng/mL)/(mg/d). A linear mixed model, allowing multiple observations from the same patient, was used to identify and quantitate the effect of factors influencing the LTG-CDR. In addition to age and gender, a total of 35 different comedications (25 drugs used in psychiatry as well as 10 other drugs) were evaluated. With women younger than 70 years as the reference group, factors found to lower the LTG-CDR significantly were: male gender and comedication with carbamazepine, ethinylestradiol, fluoxetine, lithium, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or topiramate. Factors associated with a significantly higher LTG-CDR were: age > or =70 years, and cotreatment with valproate. No antidepressants other than fluoxetine and none of the antipsychotic drugs included were associated with an altered LTG-CDR. Concerning pharmacokinetic drug interactions, we conclude that lamotrigine can be safely combined with most psychotropic drugs."}, {"Title": "History of psychiatric education in Singapore.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry was largely a forgotten discipline in the first 75 years of the medical school.

Control over labelling processes in medicine is ordinarily imposed via medical schools, textbooks, education or by diagnostic manuals. Diagnostic labels often change following new discoveries in underlying pathology such as 'consumption' being relabelled as 'TB' or 'cancer'. Sub-types of broad diagnostic labels also often emerge from such discoveries e.g. 'lung cancer' or 'throat cancer'. In mental health, underlying pathology is the subject of ongoing debate spanning ideas including the brain as a faulty organ, faulty genetics and environmental problems. With controversy over pathology comes controversy over labels and the idea that labels may be used not just for communication, but as devices of social and professional control, arising out of a social process. This study explores the codification of the diagnostic label 'depression' which emerged in the twentieth-century and has proliferated with numerous sub-types over the last 40 years. The aim is to examine its social determinants and context. Medline is used as a data source for professional label usage. A range of depression sub-type labels in professional use was identified. This exercise revealed many official and 'unofficial' terms in professional use. Citation rate plots by year were then generated for these depression sub-type labels. The rise and fall of different labels are examined in relation to social determinants and context, including publication of diagnostic manuals DSM and ICD, power shifts in psychiatry, the discovery of psychiatric drugs and the shift from inpatient to community care. Exploring the changing use of official and unofficial labels over time in this way provides a novel historical perspective on the concept of depression in the late twentieth-century."}, {"Title": "Clinical correlates of bipolar disorder in a large, referred sample of children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "To compare the prevalence, clinical correlates, and comorbidity among children and adolescents with bipolar disorder (BPD) assessed in the early 1990s (first cohort) with those evaluated over the last 7 years (second cohort).\nSubjects were consecutively referred children (N=108) and adolescents (N=197) with a DSM-III-R BPD diagnosis, referred to a child psychiatry service and evaluated with identical structured assessment methods.\nMania was identified in 16% of referred youth in both age groups and cohorts; in both age groups and cohorts, the clinical picture was predominantly irritable and mixed, and the course was chronic. Youth with BPD in both age groups and cohorts frequently had comorbidity with ADHD, psychosis and anxiety disorders. They also had high rates of psychiatric hospitalization and evidence of severely impaired psychosocial functioning.\nThe consistency of clinical features of bipolar disorder seen across age groups (children vs. adolescents) and cohorts (early and late cohorts) over the past decade supports the hypothesis that BPD in the young is a severe condition afflicting a sizeable minority of referred youth.

The research notably describes the practice and position of the Reference Nurse (hereafter RN) in this role. As the aim is to know better the practice of the RN for the training and supervision of student nurses, this is an approach of mutual understanding that every RN is individually interviewed, then that researchers meet them again, this time in groups (by region), which enables among other things, to discuss certain positions which came out of a first analysis of discussions. In this aim, within a university hospital, twenty-four nurses working in internal Medicine, Psychiatry and Surgery, were interviewed by a research team. The context of this research is particular and interesting in several respects. The research was carried out in partnership between two institutions, one institution of university care and one institution of training in nursing care; the research team therefore includes people from both institutions. It is the encounter of two worlds that have a joint function, that is to train nurses, but that also have trend and themes that are specific to them, or even antinomic; all this in a context of educational and organizational changes of the nursing training. The research themes are the activities of training and supervision carried out, the arbitration of their caring and educational practice, the key moments of training and supervision, their objective look at this role, the ideal thing as they would see it. RN described a system which is not much formal, essentially marked out by key moments such as the entry in the care unit of the student, the welcome, exchanges with the student, punctuated with educational assessment and end-of-training assessment. When giving to the patients, RN develop some forms of activities with the student which ensure the work prescribed on behalf of their responsibilities, while trying to adapt themselves and interact with the student as well as with the contextual situation. The student's questions are uses as much to check her knowledge, her understanding of the caring situations, her ability to get organised, to argue as to understand her better in her real-life experience, her self-esteem, to put her well at ease, in confidence to facilitate her apprenticeship. The quality of dialogistic communication is strongly emphasized as necessary to training and supervision. Evaluation is an important part of the supervisory work and reference nurses actually showed a tension between a control position and a confidence position in the practice of the student's follow-up. RN expressed their wish to have specific time to train and supervise the student, would like to increase partnership with schools, and requested some educational support.

We have therefore collected data from the clinical records of all in-patients with ICD-9/ICD-10 diagnoses of schizophrenia hospitalized at the Department of Psychiatry of the Medical University Innsbruck in the years 1989, 1995, 1998 and 2001. Data from 1989 to 1998 showed a significant decrease in the use of two or more antipsychotics given simultaneously.

The aim of this study was to investigate determinants of treatment motivation in emergency psychiatric patients.\nA cross-sectional study of 719 patients was made. Motivation for treatment and other clinical variables were assessed using the Severity of Psychiatric Illness scale and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale.\nIn all, 47% of patients were not motivated for treatment and they also had severe clinical problems. Lack of motivation was associated with danger to others [odds ratio (OR) 2.03; confidence interval (CI) 1.21-3.40], substance abuse (OR 1.71; CI 1.09-2.67), suspiciousness (OR 1.4; CI 1.19-1.64), grandiosity (OR 1.19; CI 1.01-1.4), anxiety (OR 0.74; CI 0.64-0.86), and GAF score (OR 0.98; CI 0.96-0.99).\nLack of motivation for treatment is a common phenomenon among severely mentally ill patients seen by emergency psychiatric services.

It is posited that these phenomena, whenever they are accompanied by the features characteristic of an epileptic consciousness (suddenness, automatic nature, great intensity and a strong sensation of strangeness) should be diagnosed as partial seizures with a psychic content, regardless of the availability of an EEG. The co-occurrence of these four clinical signs, which are relatively simple to objectivize, is a more reliable clinical criterion for diagnosis than a transcraneal electroencephalogram, which, as is known, is of little value in measuring the electrical activity of partial seizures. Moreover, an interpretation of this type makes it possible to reconcile scientific data from various neurosciences which thus far have seemed contradictory."}, {"Title": "Predictors of professional and personal satisfaction with a career in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Many factors, including personal experience and personality traits, contribute to the emotional difficulties that psychiatrists experience in their professional work.

We conducted a series of regression analyses to determine factors related to career satisfaction or regret. A belief in the intrinsic value of psychiatry, a low perceived degree of emotional burden from patients, financial success, and satisfaction with psychotherapeutic work emerged consistently as significant predictors. A subsequent discriminant function analysis indicated that all 4 of these variables accurately predicted those psychiatrists with extreme satisfaction or dissatisfaction with work.\nThese results reveal several variables associated with career satisfaction in the practice of psychiatry that might be useful to discuss with residents who are beginning their careers."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry and psychotherapy in the managed care era: present and future in Israel and learning from the American experience].", "Abstract": "The Israeli mental health system is undergoing reform, with privatization being a main component.

He soon abandoned this attempt realizing it was immature considering the neuroscientific knowledge available to him. For the rest of his career he limited himself to psychological formulations. Along the same lines, lacking etiology for mental disorders, the diagnostic system of psychiatry is exclusively descriptive. The need for a brain related diagnosis of mental disorders is important for developing better treatments and more reliable diagnosis. Today with the development of neuroscience it is time to go back to Freud's initial attempts and explain mental disorders as altered neuronal organizations in the brain. The neural network level is chosen as the relevant description level for mental functions. Plasticity is chosen as a general concept for neuronal dynamics explaining neuropathology of psychiatric disorders. Plasticity is divided according to timescales into \"fast plasticity,\" \"slow plasticity\" and \"stable plasticity\". It is proposed that normal mental functions require optimal balance among all the plasticity timescales. Mental disorders arise when such balance is disturbed, thus mental disorders could be reformulated as deficiencies of the different plasticity processes. Changes in coherence synchrony and phase-locking membrane potentials in cortically spread neuronal ensembles are all expressions of fast plasticity. Synaptogenic and neurogenic processes, such as brain derived neurotrophic factor-dependent processes, are defined as slow plasticity. Finally those synaptic and neuronal pathways that consolidated into long lasting circuits are referred to as stable plasticity. With the aid of a neural network model simulating the plasticity imbalance, a mathematical formulation could be realized for mental disorders. Once achieved this mathematical formulation could form a guiding framework for interpreting brain-imaging data collected from psychiatric patients. Such a model is realized using interconnected \"modules\" each simulating the relevant plasticity dynamics relevant for the model. Diagnosing plasticity imbalance has some advantages over current descriptive psychiatric diagnosis. It is brain-related thus less stigmatising in the sense that mental disorders are brain disorders and not \"person\" disorders. The diagnostic system is much more flexible allowing for a high degree of variations and combinations in the description of the disorders thus naturally accounting for comorbidities. Most importantly, this diagnostic model is brain-related offering research targets for intervention and a theoretical framework guiding such interventions."}, {"Title": "Empirical evidence for an invariant three-factor structure of the Parental Bonding Instrument in six European countries.", "Abstract": "The objective of the present study was to test the Parental Bonding Instrument's (PBI) three-factor structure (care, overprotection, and authoritarianism) found by [Cox, B.J., Enns, M.W., Clara, I.P. 2000, The Parental Bonding Instrument: confirmatory evidence for a three-factor model in a psychiatric clinical sample and in the National Comorbidity Survey, Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology 35 (2000) 353-357.] on an eight-item short form of the scale.

Psychiatrists experienced a sense of cultural 'dissonance' on first exposure to the Samoan views. The Samoan notion of self was considered to challenge the universalist assumptions of Western psychiatric theories as understood by the participants. The Samoan relational notion of self had implications for clinical interviewing, understanding of phenomenology, formulation and treatment planning with Samoan patients and their families.\nDedicated Samoan or Pacific Island mental health services would allow culture-specific concepts central to an understanding of mental health to be embedded in service delivery. The process used in this study and the notion of dialectical tension could be used in the cultural education of mental health clinicians. The cultural accountability process models an important aspect of such training."}, {"Title": "Is grey literature essential for a better control of publication bias in psychiatry?

In order to determine the risk of bias in the studies evaluated and to avoid bias in generalizing conclusions from the reviews it is therefore important to use a very strict methodology in systematic reviews. One bias which may affect the generalization of results is publication bias, which is determined by the nature and direction of the study results. To control or minimize this type of bias, the authors of systematic reviews undertake comprehensive searches of medical databases and expand on the findings, often undertaking searches of grey literature (material which is not formally published). This paper attempts to show the consequences (and risk) of generalizing the implications of grey literature in the control of publication bias, as was proposed in a recent systematic work. By repeating the analyses for the same outcome from three different systematic reviews that included both published and grey literature our results showed that confusion between grey literature and publication bias may affect the results of a concrete meta-analysis."}, {"Title": "Disciplinary action against physicians: who is likely to get disciplined?", "Abstract": "We sought to determine the characteristics of disciplined physicians at-large and the risk of disciplinary action over time and to report the type and frequency of complaints and the nature of disciplinary actions against allopathic physicians in Oklahoma.\nDescriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazards modeling of publicly available data on physicians licensed by the Oklahoma Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision.\nAmong 14,314 currently or previously licensed physicians, 396 (2.8%) had been disciplined.

The use of partial agonists for treating hypertension was found to limit some of the side-effects in some patients. This led to the investigation of partial agonists as a treatment modality in psychiatric disorders. Partial agonists have a lower intrinsic efficacy than full agonists leading to reduced maximum response. They can act as antagonists by competing for receptor binding with full agonists. The level of activity depends on the level of endogenous receptor activity. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor, is used to treat patients with addiction and decreases the symptoms of withdrawal and risks of overdose and intoxication. The anxiolytic buspirone shows partial agonism at 5-HT(1A) receptors, and this seems to provide anxioselective effects, without inducing extrapyramidal side-effects, convulsions, tolerance or withdrawal reactions. In schizophrenia, partial dopamine agonism results in antagonistic effects at sites activated by high concentrations of dopamine and agonistic effects at sites activated by low concentrations of dopamine. This stabilizes the dopamine system to effect antipsychotic action without inducing adverse motor or hormonal events. Aripiprazole is the first 'dopamine system stabilizer', and the data are promising, with efficacy at least equivalent to that with current atypical antipsychotics but fewer of the troublesome side-effects. Partial agonists seem to provide a way to fine-tune the treatment of psychiatric disorders by maximizing the treatment effect while minimizing undesirable adverse events."}, {"Title": "A survey of the off-label use of mood stabilizers in a large psychiatric hospital.", "Abstract": "The term 'off-label' prescribing refers to the use of a drug outside the terms of its Marketing Authorization, including prescribing for an unlicensed indication. The aims of the study were to determine the frequency of off-label prescriptions for mood stabilizers (lithium and antiepileptics) among inpatients of a large psychiatric hospital, the nature of the off-label clinical indications in use and whether patients had been informed about the off-label usage.A cross-sectional survey of inpatients aged 18-65 years at St Andrew's Hospital, Northampton, UK and interviews with consultant psychiatrists about off-label usage of mood stabilizers were carried out. Of the 249 patients studied, 75 (30.1%) were receiving one or more mood stabilizers, of which 71 (94.7%) were off-label. The most frequently cited off-label indications for mood stabilizers were: prophylaxis of mood swings (48 cases), treatment of aggression (31), manic symptoms (10), antipsychotic augmentation in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (7) and post-traumatic stress disorder (6). Lithium was prescribed infrequently. The reasons for this are discussed. Although in most instances the psychiatrist was aware the drug was being used off-label, in less than one-third of cases had the patient been informed of this, partly because of anticipated difficulties in their understanding the off-label concept, but also because of concerns that this information could adversely affect compliance. The off-label prescription of mood stabilizers is very common in psychiatry and such usage benefits patients. When prescribing off-label, psychiatrists should consider the evidence that the drug is likely to be effective for the unlicensed indication. Where there is limited evidence of benefit, a trial of the drug, with clinical monitoring, may be indicated. Patients should be fully informed about their medication, and this includes information that the prescription is off-label. Pharmacists can assist this process.

Trained as a physician, psychologist and philosopher he saw better than many the impending epistemological crisis that was to affect disciplines such as psychology and medical psychology as they were being taken over by the natural sciences. The problem he endeavoured to resolve was double-headed. On the one hand, Lotze believed that the mechanisms proposed by physiology and other relevant natural sciences were essential to the explanation of human behaviour provided that its meaning and context were respected; on the other, he wanted to do away with the mysterious (metaphysical) explanations such as 'vital force' which in his time were still popular in biology. The solutions he eventually offered can understandably be seen as a weak compromise and one which statisfied no one. Materialists \u00e0 outrance such as Vogt, B\u00fcchner, Lange and Ribot though he was too 'metaphysical'; spiritualist philosophers believed that he had surrendered too much to biology. It is likely that Lotze remained, in fact, a metaphysician as can be ascertained by studying his concept of Seele (soul, mind) into which he packed enough furniture to make many believe that he was an idealist thinker.

By 1916 German psychiatrists had already established a concept of illness that continued to be used until World War II and beyond, albeit with a changing terminology. The vague term 'war neurosis' was commonly used, but covered different, partly overlapping concepts.

The contrast between these two studies and between the careers of Fanon and Collomb reveals some of the difficulties in creating cultural and gender sensitivity in psychiatry or psychology."}, {"Title": "[Somatic symptoms of depression].", "Abstract": "The somatic component of depression is an important clinical phenomenon. The role of somatic amplification, alexithymia, anger and symptom attribution has been investigated in the genesis of the somatic symptoms of depression.\nThe study was carried out with 32 patients attending the outpatient psychiatry clinics of Karadeniz Technical University Medical School, meeting the diagnosis of depression according to DSM-IV, and 34 healthy subjects. The subjects were assessed with the Beck Depression Scale, the Beck Anxiety Scale, the Hamilton Depression Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the Somatosensory Amplification Scale, the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale the Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, the Symptom Interpretation Questionnaire and a data form for recording sociodemographic characteristics.\nThe sociodemographic characteristics of the sample were similar. The anxiety, alexithymia, and anger-in scores were significantly higher, while anger-control scores were significantly lower in the depressive subjects. Psychologizing attributes were positively correlated with depression and anxiety. Normalizing was negatively correlated with anxiety. Somatizating was correlated with the difficulty in identifying feelings subscale of alexithymia.\nThese findings show that depressive patients are more alexithymic, have more difficulty in controlling their anger and introject their anger more compared to the healthy controls. Depressed and anxious subjects psychologize, and subjects with difficulty in identifying emotions somatize their symptoms."}, {"Title": "A positron emission tomography (PET) investigation of the role of striatal dopamine (D2) receptor availability in spatial cognition.", "Abstract": "The functional significance of age-related changes in regional brain dopamine (DA) function is poorly understood in health. Two recent studies have reported positive linear associations between measures of striatal DA (D2) receptor availability (binding potential) and specific aspects of motor and cognitive performance, after controlling for the effects of age [(Volkow, N.D., Gur, R.C., Wang, G.-J., Fowler, J.S., Moberg, P.J., Ding, Y.-S., Hitzemann, R., Smith, G., Logan, J., 1998.

[(11)C] Raclopride (RAC) positron emission tomography (PET) was used to assess dopamine (D2) receptor availability. The CANTAB neuropsychological test battery was used to assess spatial span, spatial working memory (SWM) and planning ability. Age showed significant linear correlations with several of the CANTAB performance measures. After controlling for age effects, DA (D2) receptor measures in left-sided striatal regions (caudate and putamen) were significantly and positively correlated with 'perfect solution' scores--the measure of performance accuracy--on the Tower of London (TOL) test of spatial planning. When this relationship was examined in relation to task difficulty, only perfect scores for the most 'difficult' (4-move) problems were significantly correlated with BP measures in all striatal regions, most notably the right and left caudate nuclei. Paradoxically, individuals with higher DA (D2) receptor measures in the right caudate performed less accurately on the SWM task, exhibiting a higher number of errors within each search sequence. The relative contribution of striatal DA (D2) receptor availability to specific aspects of cognitive performance needs to be evaluated in larger mixed-sex samples to facilitate the meaningful investigation of the potential therapeutic benefits of DA (D2) agonists in later life."}, {"Title": "Northern ProCure21 scheme wins prize.", "Abstract": "The Newcastle, North Tyneside and Northumberland Mental Health NHS Trust and the Laing O'Rourke Team were awarded the best practice runner-up prize at the recent North East Constructing Excellence Awards for their Adult Forensic Psychiatry Development (Phase 1) at St. Nicholas Hospital, Gosforth.

This preference, which mostly reflects the phase of the circadian pacemaker, is determined in part by mutations on the CLOCK gene, and by environmental factors such as the month of birth. It has been suggested that eveningness might be a susceptibility factor for depressive disorders. Two self-rated questionnaires are available (the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, MEQ, and the Composite Scale for Morningness) and have been adapted for use with youngsters: the Junior-MEQ and the Morningness-Eveningness Scale for Children (MESC), respectively. Most studies concern adult samples, but it is accepted that puberty is associated with a phase delay in the circadian pacemaker die a shift towards eveningness) occuring around age 12 in both genders. In this study, we examined the psychometric properties of the French version of the MESC in 3 independent samples of adolescents (total n = 392) recruited in the community or during hospitalization in paediatric department, most of them after they attempted suicide. A three-way ANCOVA showed no gender or age effect but rather a strong group effect: hospitalized adolescents scored about 3 points below the community samples (ie towards an eveningness tendency). In each sample, the internal consistency for this 10-item measure was satisfactory (mean alpha = 0.76) and the same two-factor structure was found (Morningness and Planification) as shown by procrustes rotations. As expected, there was a negative correlation between the MESC scores and reported times of rising, of going to bed, of best intellectual and physical performances, but no correlation with the number of minutes of sleep needed. The test-retest stability was acceptable within a 8-month delay although the sample size was limited (n = 20). In line with literature data, we found a modest negative correlation about -0.20 in 2 of the samples with two depression measures (MADRS and CES-D). Finally, we assessed the effect of the month of birth on the MESC total score by a non-linear regression adjusted for age and gender that included a one-cycle cosinus function. We found that birth in March-April was associated with eveningness while birth in September-October was associated with morningness. The peak and nadir occur two months before those found in a large sample of young adults. However, this result could not be replicated in the sample of hospitalized adolescents suggesting that the effect might have been smoothed by a \"pathological\" factor. Reasons for this descrepancy and implications for developmental psychiatry are discussed. More precisely, we postulate a relationship between morningness and impulsivity-related personality traits. In conclusion, the MESC is a psychometrically sound instrument in need of further validity assessment."}, {"Title": "The problem behavior model: the development of a stalkers clinic and a threateners clinic.", "Abstract": "Traditionally, forensic mental health services have focused on the assessment and treatment of offenders with serious mental disorders. In recent years, there has been growing recognition that forensic clinicians have an important role to play for those offenders who engage in criminal acts driven by psychological or/and social problems, which may, or may not, occur in conjunction with a major mental disorder. This is especially true for specific offenses such as stalking and threatening. This article describes the innovation of the problem behavior model. This model uses a reductionist approach and the nexus between psychiatry and psychology to address the complex phenomena associated with specific problem behaviors that often culminate in offenses. The model is illustrated by describing the development of specialist clinics for the problem behaviors of stalking and threatening."}, {"Title": "Case definition in epidemiologic studies of AD/HD.", "Abstract": "Propose a five-step multigating, multimodal procedure for research case definition and identification of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) in population-based epidemiologic studies.\nSubjects included a birth cohort of all children born between 1976 and 1982 who remained in Rochester after age 5. Screening for AD/HD required 4 steps, using these sources: school/medical records, computerized diagnostic index, and private psychiatry records. In step 5, research criteria were applied to potential cases. The model for defining cases used combinations of three categories of information (DSM-IV, questionnaire, clinical diagnosis).

Using National Comorbidity Survey data from those 609 respondents who had lifetime histories of panic attacks or PD, we tested this prediction. Neither respiratory symptom (smothering; dyspnea) strongly differentiated between respondents with PD and those with only panic attacks. Respiratory symptom endorsement was unrelated to PD when the number of other symptoms endorsed was controlled; furthermore, respiratory symptoms had slight effect sizes and were not included in a multivariate context. In contrast, fear of dying had the largest effect size, an association with PD that persisted after control for other symptom endorsement, and a continuing importance in multivariate analyses. Strikingly, panic attack respondents who reported having had only one panic attack were as likely as PD respondents to report respiratory symptoms during panic. These findings, although based on retrospective self-report and thus subject to recall bias, are inconsistent with the hypothesis that respiratory symptoms during panic have diagnostic significance."}, {"Title": "Why a new online open access journal in the field of clinical and epidemiological research in mental health?", "Abstract": "Clinical Practice and Epidemiology in Mental Health will encompass all aspects of clinical and epidemiological research in psychiatry and mental health, and will aim to build a bridge between clinical and epidemiological research.

A number of instruments have been developed for this purpose, which are outlined in the following review. For the most part, these tools rest on a definition of competency put forward by Appelbaum and Roth [Appelbaum, P. S., & Roth, L. H. (1982). Competency to consent to research. A psychiatric overview.

Therefore, the present review will summarize current thinking on competence as well as the strengths, weaknesses, and psychometric properties of existing measures. As competency assessment will be more or less necessary depending on the patient population, another goal of the paper was to assemble the major findings pertaining to patient groups that have impairments in capacity. Although competency varies between and within diagnostic groups, empirical studies consistently demonstrate increased risk for some populations, and clinicians or researchers should be aware of this information.

The current study was conducted to extend follow-up evaluations through 10 years of illness to determine whether neuropsychological functions remain stable or deteriorate over a longer time period. Twenty-one first episode patients and 8 controls were re-evaluated 10 years after an initial evaluation on neuropsychological and clinical measures. Repeated measures analyses demonstrated no differences between patients and controls in degree of change over this time period nor was change in symptoms reliably associated with improvement or deterioration in cognitive abilities. However, baseline level of cognitive functioning was correlated with the degree of change. Thus, when the baseline level of functioning was controlled for in the analyses, less or lack of improvement was seen in the patients compared with controls in verbal intellectual functioning, delayed verbal and nonverbal recall, and cognitive inhibition (Stroop Color Word Test). In no test did patients deteriorate significantly more than controls. We conclude that most first episode patients have had considerable cognitive decline by the time of their first hospitalization and that it remains relatively stable through at least 10 years of illness. Most cognitive change takes place early in this illness, prior to the first hospitalization, but its exact timing still remains unknown."}, {"Title": "A survey of health care practitioners' knowledge of the QT interval.", "Abstract": "To assess health care practitioners' ability to correctly measure the QT interval, and to identify factors and medications that may increase the risk of QT-interval prolongation and torsades de pointes.\nA cross-sectional analysis of a survey administered between April 2002 and March 2003.\nHealth care practitioners attending Grand Rounds Conferences at 6 academic institutions in the United States in internal medicine and psychiatry and at 6 community hospitals in the same geographical areas as the academic institutions.\nAnonymous, self-administered questionnaire that included 20 questions on the QT interval.\nOf approximately 826 attendees, 517 (63%) completed the survey.

The loss of responsibility arises from the repression of the fundamental existential dimensions of the patients. Repression of love and purpose causes depersonalization (i.e., a lack of responsibility for being yourself and for the contact with others, loss of direction and purpose in life). Repression of strength in mind and emotions leads to derealization (the breakdown of the reality testing, often with mental delusions and hallucinations). The repression of joy and gender leads to devitalization (emotional emptiness, loss of joy, personal energy, sexuality, and pleasure in life). The losses of existential dimensions are invariably connected to traumas with life-denying decisions. Healing the wounds of the soul by holding and processing will lead to the recovery of the person's character, purpose of life, and existential responsibility. It can be very difficult to help a psychotic patient. The physician must first love his patient unconditionally and then fully understand the patient in order to meet and support the patient to initiate the holistic process of healing. It takes motivation and willingness to suffer on behalf of the patients in order to heal, as the existential and emotional pain of the traumas resulting in insanity is often overwhelming. We believe that most psychiatric diseases can be alleviated or cured by the loving and caring physician who masters the holistic toolbox. Further research is needed to document the effect of holistic medicine in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Dual reuptake inhibitors incur lower rates of tachyphylaxis than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: a retrospective study.", "Abstract": "The notion that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be associated with higher relapse rates than other antidepressants during maintenance treatment (tachyphylaxis) has been discussed for years, but to date there is little or no empirical evidence confirming this phenomenon.

Atypical antipsychotic drugs are used in psychiatry since the beginning of 1990. These drugs differ from the \"typical\" antipsychotics used previously, as they have less extrapyramidal side effects, and because of this they are tolerated better, but are associated with weight-gain and disturbances in carbohydrate metabolism. Ghrelin is an orexigen hormone partaking in body weight regulation. It is produced in the enteroendocrine P/D1 cells of the gastric mucosa and secreted to the circulation. The aim of our study was to determine ghrelin levels of atypical antipsychotic-treated patients in relationship with their body mass index (BMI) and carbohydrate metabolism. We measured the fasting serum ghrelin levels in 56 patients (male/female: 16/40, age mean+/-S.D.: 50.6+/-5.6 years) treated with atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine, risperidon and quetiapine), and in 75 healthy control subjects, age and gender matched (RIA Linco, USA) in relationship with their BMI and their fasting and 75 g OGTT 120 min blood glucose values. The serum ghrelin levels of the patient group were notably higher (1333+/-659 pg/ml) than in the control group (368+/-103, p<0.0001; Mann-Whitney). We found no difference among the four antipsychotics in weight-gain, diabetes prevalence and the serum ghrelin levels. The BMI of the patient group was significantly higher (29.3+/-7.2 kg/m2 versus 24.3+/-3.7 kg/m2, p<0.0001; Mann-Whitney); 32% of them had blood glucose abnormality (18/56).

The orexigen effect of elevated serum ghrelin levels can contribute to the weight-gain and high diabetes prevalence associated with atypical antipsychotic treatment.

New medications have been developed that modulate calcium channels but also show promise in psychiatric and neurologic applications. Gabapentin and pregabalin bind to a subunit of calcium channels--the alpha2delta receptors--thereby reducing calcium influx to neurons. As a result, less glutamate is released from nerve endings that use excitatory amino acids as transmitters. This in turn reduces substance P-related activation of AMPA heteroreceptors on noradrenergic synapses, total transmitter release, and finally neuronal activity. That mechanism is the probable explanation for gabapentin's and pregabalin's usefulness in the treatment of neuropathic pain but also their possible anticonvulsive and anxiolytic effects."}, {"Title": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder endophenotypes.", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable disorder with a multifactorial pattern of inheritance.

Historically, association between cancer and depression was identified first. The article presents epidemiological data and analyses possible common mechanisms of somatic disease and depression. In the last part the actual data about the treatment of depression in individual somatic diseases are described."}, {"Title": "Phrenology and the neurosciences: contributions of F. J. Gall and J. G. Spurzheim.", "Abstract": "The pseudoscience of phrenology arose from the observations and intuitions of Franz Joseph Gall (1758-1828) and his disciple Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776-1832). Gall believed that mental functions are localized in discrete parts of the brain, which he called organs. He located the organs subserving intellectual functions chiefly in the cerebral cortex. To support this doctrine, Gall and Spurzheim carried out extensive neuro-anatomical studies, and made some important discoveries. The Gordon Craig Library contains a book by Spurzheim on the anatomy of the brain, published in London in 1826, which summarizes these discoveries. Gall also believed that the functional strength of the cerebral and cerebellar organs was expressed by their bulk: a well-developed organ caused a bulge in the overlying cranial bone. Hence, feeling the bumps of the skull was a means of assessing the individual's personality. This very fallacious component of Gall's doctrine had great influence in the nineteenth century, affecting psychiatry, criminology and educational theory. Further research demolished Gall's doctrine, and phrenology sank into disrepute. Nevertheless, phrenological thinking played an important part in the growth of clinical neurology in the second half of the nineteenth century."}, {"Title": "Power Therapies and possible threats to the science of psychology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Advocates of new therapies frequently make bold claims regarding therapeutic effectiveness, particularly in response to disorders which have been traditionally treatment-refractory. This paper reviews a collection of new therapies collectively self-termed \"The Power Therapies\", outlining their proposed procedures and the evidence for and against their use. These therapies are then put to the test for pseudoscientific practice.\nTherapies were included which self-describe themselves as \"Power Therapies\". Published work searches were conducted on each therapy using Medline and PsychInfo databases for randomized controlled trials assessing their efficacy, except for the case of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing has more randomized controlled studies conducted on its efficacy than any other treatment for trauma and thus, previous meta-analyses were evaluated.\nIt is concluded that these new therapies have offered no new scientifically valid theories of action, show only non-specific efficacy, show no evidence that they offer substantive improvements to extant psychiatric care, yet display many characteristics consistent with pseudoscience."}, {"Title": "Evolution of the Behavioral Sciences Branch of the Space Medicine and Health Care Systems Office at the Johnson Space Center.", "Abstract": "This paper presents a brief history of psychology and psychiatry roles in psychological selection and how these roles have evolved into the Behavioral Sciences Branch at the Johnson Space Center USC), Houston, TX. Since the initial selection of the Mercury Seven, the first United States astronauts, psychologists and psychiatrists have been involved in astronaut selection activities. Initially very involved in psychological selection of astronauts, the role of behavioral health specialists waned during the Gemini and Apollo years. With the onset of the NASA/Mir/International Space Station Program, the introduction of payload and mission specialists, and international collaboration, the evolving need for behavioral health expertise became apparent. Medical and psychological selection processes were revisited and the Johnson Space Center developed a separate operational unit focused on behavioral health and performance. This work unit eventually became the Behavioral Sciences branch of the Space Medicine and Health Care Systems Office. Research was allocated across groups at JSC, other NASA space centers, and the National Space Biomedical Research Institute, and was funded by NASA Headquarters. The current NASA focus on human space exploration to the Moon and beyond re-emphasizes the importance of the human-centered approach."}, {"Title": "[The lethal ingestion of cigarettes in adults: does it really exist?].", "Abstract": "A 35-year old patient suffering from a borderline personality disorder was admitted to our clinic with ingestions of cigarettes seven times within 15 months.

We collected information on all parasuicides presenting to the emergency department of a general hospital over a 3-month period.

One hundred and five (85.4%) were detected in the emergency department. Ninety-five (77.2%) were referred to the liaison psychiatry service. Liaison psychiatric risk assessment agreed with emergency department risk assessment in all cases that emergency doctors judged to be at low risk of suicide. However in cases that emergency doctors judged to be high risk the liaison assessment agreed in only 38.5% of cases. Emergency doctors appear to be appropriately cautious in their assessment of risk. However, parasuicides regularly go undetected in hospital and are not always referred for psychiatric evaluation when detected.

The objective of this article is to increase awareness about this vagueness among academic psychiatrists and to offer a suggested curriculum to facilitate implementation.\nThe authors present a curriculum covering major aspects of the theory and practice of compliance. The proposed curriculum is divided into five core components that can be used together or separately. These components are: 1) definition of compliance and noncompliance; 2) understanding how compliance depends on efficacy; 3) assessment of compliance and noncompliance; 4) the importance of the therapeutic alliance; and 5) pharmacological and psychosocial strategies to improve compliance. These five sections can be modified into specific lectures that are added to ongoing psychopharmacology, psychiatric interviewing, or psychotherapy courses.\nA careful review of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) core curriculum found no mention of medication compliance/adherence as a specific training goal, and our residency program, like many others, did not have a specific course that focused on this issue. To address this omission, the authors designed and taught a five-session course for PGY-III and PGY-IV psychiatry residents that specifically addressed assessment and management of noncompliance. It was piloted in the 2003-2004 academic year.

The first half of each module is a case conference, and the second is a literature review of papers related to the case. The case conference focuses on the extent to which past treatment has been consistent with evidence-supported guidelines and algorithms, and the discussants make recommendations that take the relevant scientific evidence into consideration.

Their use as teaching materials may be limited by their reliance on Diagnostic and Statistical manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) diagnoses, especially for patients with unclear or complicated diagnosing pictures.

This is important in the context of the free (and growing) movement of the medical workforce across European Union (EU) countries' borders.\nA complete balanced two-way factorial study design was used. Ten training and ten specialist psychiatrists were recruited in each country from reputable, university hospitals. They answered 50 multiple choice questions (MCQs), translated into the appropriate language, consisting of four subcategories of questions: psychology (15 MCQs), psychopharmacology (10 MCQs), neuroscience (five MCQs) and psychopathology (20 MCQs). No memory or other types of aids were allowed at the knowledge test. A two-way analysis of variance was used to analyse the total knowledge score (number of correct answers) and the component subscores. Levene's test of equality of error variances was used to test for variance homogeneity.\nThere were significant differences in total knowledge and psychology knowledge by country and level of training. UK doctors scored 3.10 points higher than Danish doctors, with 95% confidence interval (0.97, 5.23). The knowledge of the specialists was also significantly superior to that of the training psychiatrists, with 2.30 higher score, 95% confidence interval (0.17, 4.43).

Specialists scored 1.20 higher than non-specialists with 95% confidence interval (0.05, 2.35).\nThe results indicate that there is a significant difference in level of knowledge between psychiatrists in these two EU-countries, England and Denmark. This difference seemed to be chiefly the result of different knowledge of psychology. The disparity could be a result of the fundamentally different post-graduate training system in psychiatry in the two countries. Surprisingly, the differences in total knowledge and psychology knowledge between countries were larger than the differences between levels of training. The difference in knowledge is worrying taking into consideration that there is free movement of the workforce, including doctors, across the EU.

In an attempt to resist such impressions, this paper will seek to provide an accessible introduction to Deleuze's work, and to begin to discuss how it can be employed to provide a significant critique and reconceptualization of the theoretical foundations and therapeutic practices of psychiatry, psychotherapy, and mental health nursing. In order to do this, the paper will focus upon Deleuze's masterwork, and the cornerstone to his philosophy as a whole, Difference and Repetition; in particular, it will discuss how his innovative and challenging account of time can be employed to provide a conception of human life as a 'continuity', rather than as a series of distinct 'moments' or 'events'. As well as discussing the manner in which his work can provide us with an understanding of how life is different and significant for each human being, this paper will also highlight the potential importance of Deleuze's work for logotherapy, for the recent 'turn' to 'narrative' as a psychotherapeutic approach and for contemporary mental health care's growing interest in 'social constructionism'.

The change to smaller, professional armed forces has reduced the risk of large-scale acute psychiatric casualties, and should have led to a corresponding decrease in long-term ill health, but this expected reduction seems not to have happened. Likewise, attempts at preventing psychiatric injury, by screening before deployment or debriefing after, have been disappointing. Three reasons for this are proposed: a rethinking of the relationship between trauma and long-term outcome, catalysed by the attempts of US society to come to terms with the Vietnam conflict; a broadening of the scope of psychiatric injury as it moved to the civilian sector; and the increased prominence of unexplained syndromes and contested diagnoses such as Gulf War syndrome. Traditional psychiatric injury is predictable, proportionate and can, in theory, be managed. These newer forms of injury are in contrast unanticipated, paradoxical, ill understood and hard to manage. Traditional approaches to risk management by reducing exposure have not been successful, and may increase risk aversion and reduce resilience. However, the experiences of civilians in wartime or the military show that people are not intrinsically risk-averse, provided they can see purpose in accepting risk."}, {"Title": "Atypical presentations of atypical antipsychotics.", "Abstract": "The atypical antipsychotics have been touted by many as having minimal extrapyramidal symptoms.

This review is motivated by the hypothesis that adherence to treatment is an important determinant of clinical outcomes in a wide range of settings and is particularly important in psychiatry practice where patients require treatment for months or years and premature discontinuation can have serious consequences for patient health and quality of life.\nThe author reviews the relevant literature and highlights several approaches to providing improved access to continuous medication through new and innovative delivery strategies ranging from days to annual intervals.Benefits and Disadvantages: Several solutions to the problem of discontinuous access to pharmacotherapy are being developed in the form of new, long-acting drug-delivery systems, which gradually release medication over a period of several days or weeks with a single application. Long-acting formulations of psychiatric medications offer a number of potential benefits in comparison with conventional immediate-release agents, including improved safety and effectiveness. Potential limitations to using long-acting formulations may include pain and discomfort at the injection site, perceived inconvenience of a new treatment method, preference for oral medications, and length of time to titrate down to the lowest effective dose.\nThe introduction of new, long-acting drug formulations could provide significant improvements in clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction for many patients, including those with affective disorders, schizophrenia, and alcohol dependence. Switching from oral administration to these new agents requires careful monitoring to reach the optimal dose, and patient concerns regarding the use of new delivery methods must be addressed. Long-acting formulations are not intended to be a sole form of treatment, and the use of psychotherapy as an adjunct form of treatment is still required. Controlled clinical trials of these new formulations have only recently been completed, offering clinicians a new option in their treatment regimens; however, as technologies improve, several new formulations are likely to enter clinical trials during the next few years. Psychiatrists will need to become acquainted with these technologies and educate their patients about them so they may work together to determine the most effective treatment option."}, {"Title": "The association between bullying behaviour, arousal levels and behaviour problems.", "Abstract": "Research into bullying behaviour has identified two main categories of bullying behaviour, direct bullying and relational bullying, within which different profiles are evident, namely 'pure' bullies, 'pure' victims, bully/victims and neutral children. The current study examined the relationship between direct and relational bullying profiles, arousal levels, and behaviour problems. 242 (males: 121, females: 121) Secondary school pupils (mean age 13.5 years) completed three questionnaires; the Arousal Predisposition Scale (APS) (Behav.

Results revealed that the bully/victim profile for direct and relational bullying had the highest levels of arousal compared to other bullying profiles. Conversely, direct 'pure' bullies had low levels of arousal. Clinical behaviour problems as measured by the SDQ were associated with high levels of arousal. Clinically low arousal was not related to either bullying profiles, or behaviour problems. These findings were largely consistent with the arousal theory of behaviour (Crime and personality, 1964), which indicates that arousal levels are differentially associated with distinct behaviour patterns.

Our goal was to explore the number, demographics, and qualifications of pain physicians in Ohio. The names of Ohio physicians designating themselves as pain physicians were collected from the State Medical Board of Ohio and the American Medical Association. The directories of the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), the American Board of Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Management, and the American Board of Medical Acupuncture were referenced for certification in pain medicine, pain management, or medical acupuncture. The requirements for these credentials vary widely, yet they have all been used to claim \"board certification.\" Board certification in medicine implies recognition by an ABMS member board as having completed the required training, met the standards, and then passed an examination that validates qualifications, and knowledge in a specific medical field. In 2002, there were 335 Ohio physicians designating themselves as pain physicians. Two-hundred-eighteen (65%) had at least one pain board certification. Ninety-six (29%) of the Ohio pain physicians were certified in pain medicine by the American Board of Anesthesiology, the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, or the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, which are all member boards of the ABMS. One-hundred-seventeen (35%) of the self-declared Ohio pain physicians held no pain-related board certification.

The universities' graduate programs concentrate the vast majority of the scientific production in Brazil. We assessed the annual reports from the graduate programs to the Brazilian Ministry of Education concerning master's and doctoral theses and the articles published in journals indexed by the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI). There are nine Master's and Doctoral graduate programs dedicated to research in psychiatry, neuropsychiatry, psychobiology, and mental health in the country, seven being located in southern states. During the 5-year period, from 1998 to 2002, 186 students received their doctorate degree (37/year). The programs published 637 articles in journals indexed by ISI, the majority of them in journals with an impact factor higher than 2. The research advisors' productivity varied among graduate programs, ranging from 0.6 to 2.0 articles per year in ISI-indexed journals. Despite the substantial barriers faced by the Brazilian scientific community (mainly financial and writing difficulties), Brazil's scientific mental health production is on the rise. The number of articles published in ISI-indexed journals has doubled without a significant increase in the number of graduate theses, suggesting that there was an improvement in both the quality of the scientific production and the productivity of the graduate programs.

Although rating scales provide assessments along dimensions of severity, categorization into a negative symptom subtype is typically conducted. A categorical view of negative symptoms is best reflected in the proposal that enduring, primary negative symptoms, or deficit symptoms, reflect a distinct subtype of schizophrenia . Despite an accumulation of findings that support a categorical conceptualization, the data are also consistent with a dimensional-only model where negative symptom subtypologies simply reflect an extreme on a continuum of severity. Using taxometric statistical methods , the present study examined whether a taxonic, or latent class, model best describes negative symptoms in a sample of 238 schizophrenia patients. In order to obtain more stable estimates of symptoms, ratings on the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms [Andreasen, N.C., 1982. Negative symptoms in schizophrenia: Definition and reliability. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 39, 784-788.] were averaged across two assessments over a 6-month period. Two taxometric methods, maximum covariance analysis (MAXCOV) and mean above minus below a cut (MAMBAC) identified a latent class or taxon with a base rate of approximately 28-36%. Members of the negative symptom taxon differed from the nontaxon class in that taxon members were more likely to be male and demonstrated poorer social functioning. Taxon and nontaxon schizophrenia patients did not differ in psychotic or affective symptoms. The findings converge to provide support for a categorical view of negative symptoms. Further research is required to replicate the present taxonic findings and to examine characteristics (including possible etiological factors) associated with this negative symptom taxon."}, {"Title": "Clinical holistic medicine: holistic treatment of mental disorders.", "Abstract": "We believe that holistic medicine can be used for patients with mental health disorders. With holistic psychiatry, it is possible to help the mentally ill patient to heal existentially. As in holistic medicine, the methods are love or intense care, winning the trust of the patient, getting permission to give support and holding, and daring to be fully at the patient's service. Our clinical experiences have led us to believe that mental health patients can heal if only you can make him or her feel the existential pain at its full depth, understand what the message of the suffering is, and let go of all the negative attitudes and beliefs connected with the disease. Many mentally ill young people would benefit from a few hours of existential holistic processing in order to confront the core existential pains. To help the mentally ill patient, you must understand the level of responsibility and help process the old traumas that made the patient escape responsibility for his or her own life and destiny. To guide the work, we have developed a responsibility scale going from (1) free perception over (2) emotional pain to (3) psychic death (denial of life purpose) further down to (4) escape and (5) denial to (6) destruction of own perception and (7) hallucination further down to (8) coma, suicide, and unconsciousness. This scale seems to be a valuable tool to understand the state of consciousness and the nature of the process of healing that the patient must go through."}, {"Title": "The life mission theory VII. Theory of existential (Antonovsky) coherence: a theory of quality of life, health, and ability for use in holistic medicine.", "Abstract": "A theoretical framework of existential coherence is presented, explaining how health, quality of life (QOL), and the ability to function were originally created and developed to rehabilitate human life from an existential perspective. The theory is inspired by the work of Aaron Antonovsky and explains our surprising recent empirical findings -- that QOL, health, and ability primarily are determined by our consciousness. The theory is a matrix of nine key elements in five layers: (1) coherence; (2) purpose and talent; (3) consciousness, love, and physicality/sexuality; (4) light and joy; and (5) QOL/meaning of life. The layer above causes the layer below, with the layer of QOL again feeding the fundamental layer of coherence. The model holds the person responsible for his or her own degree of reality, happiness, and being present. The model implies that when a person takes responsibility in all nine \"dimensions\" of life, he or she can improve and develop health, the ability to function, all aspects of QOL, and the meaning of life. The theory of existential coherence integrates a wide range of QOL theories from Jung and Maslow to Frankl and Wilber. It is a nine-ray theory in accordance with Gurjieff's enneagram and the old Indian chakra system. It can be used in the holistic medical clinic and in existential coaching. Love is in the center of the model and rehabilitation of love in its broadest sense is, accordingly, the essence of holistic medicine. To know yourself, your purpose of life (life mission) and talents, and taking these into full use and becoming coherent with life inside and reality outside is what human life is essentially about. The new model has been developed to integrate the existing knowledge in the complex field of holistic medicine. Its strength is that it empowers the holistic physician to treat the patient with even severe diseases and can also be used for existential rehabilitation, holistic psychiatry, and sexology. Its major weakness is that it turns holistic medicine more into an art than into a science because the physician must master intent, which is a poorly understood dimension of existence."}, {"Title": "[Finding a meaning for illness: from medical anthropology to cultural epidemiology].", "Abstract": "Every illness raises questions concerning its causes and even more its meaning. Why me? Why him? Why now? These questions call for an interpretation which goes beyond a simple application to the individual body and the medical diagnosis. This search for meaning is by no means an archaic attitude and does not only concern the cryptic fields of medicine as several studies in medical anthropology and transcultural psychiatry have shown. A review of literature in anthropology points out the basic concepts of \"health care system\", \"explanatory models\", \"etiological theories\", and \"causality of illness\".

Atypical antipsychotics are associated with a lower risk for TD than are conventional agents. A long-acting atypical antipsychotic, with more stable blood levels and lower peak blood levels than an oral formulation, may provide differential benefit regarding side effects, including movement disorders. This analysis assessed TD by defined research criteria in patients receiving long-acting, injectable risperidone.\nClinically stable subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder participated in a 50-week, open-label trial of long-acting, injectable risperidone. TD was studied by defined research criteria (Schooler, N.R., Kane, J.M., 1982. Research diagnosis for tardive dyskinesia. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 39, 486-487; Americal Psychiatric Association, 2000. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth ed. American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC). The severity of dyskinesia and other movement disorders were rated by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS).\nESRS dyskinesia data were available for 662 patients. Five of 530 subjects without dyskinesia at baseline (0.94%) met the predefined criteria for emergent persistent TD during therapy. Based on either exposure to study medication or Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 1-year rate was 1.19%. Among the 132 subjects with dyskinesia at baseline, the mean score on the ESRS physician's exam for dyskinesia improved significantly at endpoint (-2.77; P<0.0001), regardless of anticholinergic drug use. (P=0.243 for patients with versus without anticholinergic drug use.)\nIn this open-label study, treatment with long-acting risperidone was associated with a low rate of emergent persistent TD. Significant improvement in existing dyskinesias was noted. The TD rate reported here is consistent with other reports of atypical antipsychotics and substantially lower than with conventional antipsychotics."}, {"Title": "[Psychoeducation and schizophrenia: failure of education].", "Abstract": "Since two decades, psychoeducation knows a great emphasize over up psychiatry because it is economically attractive. But, what about its efficacy? It is a naturalistic study of subjective attitudes and responses towards psychoeducation of 17 schizophrenics' patients currently undergoing treatment in a daily hospital. It shows that psychoeducational tools activate defensive avoidance and interfere with therapeutic alliance. They seem to enhance mistrust, suspicion, pretense and false self. However, the literature review supports that those approaches had no impact on insight, compliance with treatment, decreasing relapse and symptomatology. Our study suggests that psychoeducation is harmful because, over it is inefficacy, it compromise therapeutic alliance and increase patients' isolation."}, {"Title": "Psychotherapy in controlled psychopharmacology trials. Does it matter if we ignore it?", "Abstract": "The controlled trial is now the standard for assessing efficacy of new treatments in Psychiatry, as it is in the rest of medicine. Psychiatric outcomes with treatment are influenced by concurrent psychosocial factors. Psychotherapy, alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy is an effective treatment. Thus, if concomitant receipt of psychotherapy is not controlled for in a psychopharmacology trial, outcome may be biased. In this study, all peer reviewed journal articles describing the results of randomized, controlled psychopharmacology trials in two separate years were carefully reviewed to assess the possible influence of control versus lack of explicit control for effect of concomitant psychotherapy on clinical outcome. One hundred sixteen articles, published in the years 1996 and 2000, were reviewed. Those with categorically positive or non-positive global outcome were assessed for description of concomitant receipt of psychotherapy by subjects randomized to different pharmacotherapy treatments. Description of comparability in potentially confounding demographic and clinical variables was present in all studies. Only 22% of 89 studies meeting inclusion criteria explicitly controlled for concomitant psychotherapy. Seventy five percent of 20 studies that did, and only 46% of 69 studies that did not, found different outcomes in groups randomized to different pharmacotherapy interventions (p=.024). This result was not accounted for by other aspects of study design such as placebo-vs.-active control comparison, trial size, length, geographic location, number of sites or authors, source of funding, or diagnostic composition)-suggesting that uncontrolled receipt of psychotherapy may reduce likelihood of finding a difference between a new treatment and a control pharmacotherapy intervention. If confirmed by further investigation, the results may warrant adoption of relevant recommendations for controlled trial design in psychopharmacology research. The method used in this report may be useful in other areas of controlled trial research to assess influence of confounding variables."}, {"Title": "[Guideline 'Delirium'].", "Abstract": "The Dutch Association of Psychiatry, together with the Dutch Association of Clinical Geriatrics and with methodological support from the Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement (CBO) has developed a guideline for the optimal diagnosis, treatment and prevention of delirium. Delirium is caused by somatic illness or the use of medication, drugs or alcohol. Delirium is common among the somatically ill admitted to a general hospital and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Important predisposing factors for delirium are: age > or =70 years, cognitive disturbances, sensory impairments, problems in daily activities, and the use of alcohol and opiates. Precipitating factors that may provoke delirium are: infection, fever, dehydration, serum electrolyte imbalance, polypharmacy, and the use of psychotropic medication, particularly anticholinergic drugs. Detection, diagnosis, and assessment of the severity of delirium are based on clinical examination, case history, observation, mental status examination including tests of cognitive function, and diagnosis of underlying somatic diseases. For daily practice, measurement tools are not necessary, nor are laboratory or imaging tests, such as electroencephalography. Haloperidol is the treatment of first choice for delirium due to somatic illness, except in patients with delirium due to drug use or medication, Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia. In cases of concurrent alcohol withdrawal syndrome, delirium may be treated with haloperidol and a benzodiazepine and B-vitamins. Medical and environmental interventions have been shown to reduce the incidence and duration of delirium."}, {"Title": "Survey of the practice of electroconvulsive therapy in teaching hospitals in India.", "Abstract": "We sought to obtain an overview of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) practice in teaching hospitals in India.\nFrom September 1, 2001, to August 31, 2002, a 29-item questionnaire enquiring about ECT practice during the past year was sent to 188 teaching institutions and psychiatric hospitals.\nSeventy-four institutions (39.4%) completed the questionnaire.

A total of 67% of the students would not consent to undergoing ECT themselves, not even if they had severe depression with psychotic features. ECT was believed to be used to bring violent patients under control by 35% of the students, was believed to be painful by 54%, and to be even dangerous by 50%. A total of 61% of the participants believed that ECT should only be used as a last resort, 35% found ECT outmoded, 32% thought that ECT causes permanent brain damage, and 14% would ban its use. Among the students refusing to be treated with ECT, the proportion of women was higher, and their attitude toward ECT was significantly more negative (P = 0.031) than that of those who would consent to ECT. The answers that psychiatrists often misuse ECT, that ECT is an outmoded therapy causing brain damage, and that the use of which should be forbidden were given more frequently by those who refused to be treated with ECT. Also, the attitude of those describing themselves as more knowledgeable about psychiatry was found to be significantly (P = 0.005) more negative than the attitude of those with minimal psychiatric knowledge.

Convergent validity, discriminant validity and the associations of the temperament measures with maternal characteristics, i.e. depression, anxiety and educational status were analyzed. The study group consisted of 101 healthy first-born infants and their primary caregivers. At the ages of 4, 8 and 12 months, positive emotionality, negative emotionality and withdrawal/anxiety were assessed by means of a parent questionnaire, naturalistic behavioural observations of the caregiver-infant interaction, and by means of laboratory routines.\nAside from just two exceptions, there were significant convergent correlations between the different measures at each age. Particularly the laboratory routines revealed a good degree of discriminant validity. Questionnaire scores often correlated with the mothers' characteristics.

Furthermore, the prevalence of mental disorder amongst elderly offenders is high. The true extent of 'elderly' crime is unknown because much of it goes undetected and unreported. This leads to a failure to detect mental illness in such offenders. Court diversion schemes may improve recognition of mental illness but these schemes usually tend to deal with the more severe crimes. This may result in an overestimation of the amount of serious crime committed by the elderly and a failure to detect mental illness amongst those who commit less serious crimes. Efforts to service this hidden morbidity call for multi-agency collaboration. Improved detection and reporting of crimes is essential if mental health difficulties in the elderly are not to go unnoticed.

To investigate these assumptions we included two recently developed instruments to measure quality of life (the WHOQoL-Bref and the EuroQoL EQ-5D) in a randomised control trial (RCT) in which two treatment conditions were compared. Aims of the study were to assess the sensitivity and validity of these quality of life (QoL)-instruments, to establish their relationship and to examine the predictors of changes in QoL. Subjective changes in QoL were measured on three assessments waves in a period of 18 months and compared to objective changes in psychopathology and social functioning in a sample of 76 chronic schizophrenic patients who participated in the RCT. Results indicated that both WHOQoL-Bref and EuroQoL EQ-5D are capable of detecting changes in QoL over time in physical and psychological well-being. The instruments partly measure the same aspects of QoL, indicated by 50% common variance on total scores. Reduction of positive psychotic symptoms appeared to be the most important factor in improving QoL. The weighted TTO-score of EuroQoL-5D, which is often used as an index in economic evaluations of health care, did however not correspond with these changes, which indicates that it is less sensitive to changes in social and psychological well-being. It's use as the core measure in (economic) health evaluation in the field of psychiatry therefore seems less appropriate."}, {"Title": "OpenSDE: a strategy for expressive and flexible structured data entry.", "Abstract": "This description focuses on the expressiveness and flexibility of OpenSDE: an application that supports recording of structured narrative data.\nOpenSDE enables data entry with (customizable) forms based on trees of medical concepts.

In 2003, POA services in New Zealand were resurveyed to determine how much progress had been made in the ensuing 5 years.\nAll POA services in New Zealand who had Faculty members were surveyed for information on their service's administrative structure; access to acute, long stay and day hospital places; staffing levels of the different disciplines; the range of services they provided, and what they considered were strengths, gaps and potential improvements.\nThirteen services responded, providing services for 387,000 elderly people. Since 1998, acute bed numbers and day hospital places had proportionately decreased nationwide, with disparity of access across the country. Inpatient nursing staff had decreased by 34%, with community nurse numbers barely increasing. There were modest increases in the number of psychiatrists, junior doctors, clinical psychologists, and social workers.\nThere has been little progress towards achieving 'Mental Health Commission Blueprint' benchmark levels of service of 1998, and nationally there has been a decrease in access to acute beds, without a concomitant increase in staff to support older people in community settings."}, {"Title": "The psychotic spectrum: validity and reliability of the Structured Clinical Interview for the Psychotic Spectrum.", "Abstract": "This study evaluates the validity and the reliability of a new instrument developed to assess the psychotic spectrum: the Structured Clinical Interview for the Psychotic Spectrum (SCI-PSY).

Testing patients' proverb understanding has widely been abandoned, however, due to poor reliability and validity of the assessment procedures. Since the underlying cognitive deficit of impaired proverb interpretation remained obscure, this study sought to determine the relation of proverb understanding with other cognitive domains, particularly 'theory of mind' or 'mindreading', in schizophrenia.\n31 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were assessed using a novel German Proverb Test [Barth, A., K\u00fcfferle, B., 2001.

Patients' task performance was compared to a group of healthy control persons.\n'Theory of mind', executive functioning and intelligence were strongly correlated with patients' ability to interpret proverbs correctly. In a regression analysis 'theory of mind' performance predicted, conservatively estimated, about 39% of the variance of proverb comprehension in the patient group.\nThe ability to interpret such metaphorical speech that is typical of many proverbs crucially depends on schizophrenic patients' ability to infer mental states.

The results obtained are expressed as number of defined daily doses (DDDs) per 100 bed days, as proposed by the WHO. The use of new generation AEDs was represented by 2% in 2001 and 5% in 2002. Majority of AEDs administered was taken by the barbiturates in both years. A wide spectrum of AEDs has been used at the Department of Paediatrics. At the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry use of barbiturates and carbamazepine predominated. The use of new AEDs at UHC has increased during the investigation period but it is still rather low compared with traditional AEDs.

The prescribers found that taking psychiatric medication was associated with sex, age, social and economic category, and social expectations. In the discourses we found consumer profiles emerging that were not found in the epidemiological literature. Discourse analysis showed implicit gender bias in the beliefs of some prescribers. CONCLUSIONS. To minimise the growing offer and demand for psychiatric medication, prescribers thought training in diagnosis and psychotherapy should be improved, case-loads should be reduced, co-ordination between services improved and alternative treatments favoured.

It would be thanks to the stormy progress of research on the neurophysiological, genetic and molecular foundations of mental disorders. The aim of the article is to assess the possibility as well as the supposed consequences of such an evolution of psychiatry. The considerations concern the peculiarity of the object of interest and the methods used in psychiatry in relation to the neurological object and methodology. This way the appraisal of raison d'etre of one common science: neuropsychiatry becomes possible. The question of fundamental importance for the evaluation of similarities and differences between the psychiatric and neurological perspectives is the way the psychophysical issue and especially the problem of the mind-brain relation are approached. The article presents the manners of solving these problems proposed by the contemporary philosophy of the mind. Together with parting with the full of errors and simplifications heritage of Descartes it appears the necessity to regard the presence of subjective mental states both conscious and unconscious in model of mind-brain relation. The example of such a solution is the biological naturalism of John Searle. The psychical life of the man in its subjective dimension remains the peculiar area of interests for psychiatry irrespective of the progress in research on the biological base of mental disorders. The especially valuable cognitive and therapeutic tool in this aspect is psychotherapy constituting the integral part of psychiatry. The present state of knowledge does not indicate that the psychotherapeutic wing of psychiatry can lose its importance and rather somewhat the contrary. The progress of neurobiology does not have to threaten the autonomy of psychiatry by any means and the maintenance of this autonomy depends decisively on the psychiatrists themselves."}, {"Title": "[Transsexualism as an interdisciplinary phenomenon].", "Abstract": "The authors express their criticism on the currently prevailing Polish diagnostic and therapeutic criteria of transsexualism.

Without having direct evidence to link neuroleptic dysphoria to dopamine, it was generally understood that dopamine played a significant role in its genesis. In recent neuroimaging studies and dopamine depletion strategies, the role of dopamine in the genesis of neuroleptic dysphoria has been directly confirmed.\nNeuroleptic dysphoria is a valid construct, which has significant implications for treatment and outcome. It is now clear that it relates to dopamine activities in the nigrostriatal complex. Recent research has also raised the issue of whether neuroleptic dysphoria is a variant of extrapyramidal symptoms. Meanwhile, the role of dopamine in both the genesis of neuroleptic dysphoria and addictive behaviour has raised the issue of both conditions being different facets of the schizophrenic disease process.

Two recent controlled medication trials, one with lamotrigine and one with fluoxetine, failed to show efficacy. There is some evidence for dysregulation of endogenous opioid systems in depersonalization, and a few studies have suggested that opioid antagonists may have efficacy in the treatment of dissociation and depersonalization symptoms. In this prospective open treatment trial, 14 subjects were recruited and treated with naltrexone for 6 weeks to a maximum dose of 100 mg/d (first 7 subjects) or 10 weeks to a maximum dose of 250 mg/d (next 7 subjects). Mean naltrexone dose was 120 mg/d. There was an average 30% reduction of symptoms with treatment, as measured by 3 validated dissociation scales. Three patients were very much improved, and 1 patient was much improved with naltrexone treatment. These findings are potentially promising in a highly treatment-refractory disorder for which no treatment guidelines exist and warrant a randomized controlled trial."}, {"Title": "Characteristics of patients with organic brain syndromes : A cross-sectional 2-year follow-up study in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Organic Brain Syndromes (OBS) are often missed in clinical practice. Determining their varied presentations may help in earlier detection, better management, and, assessing prognosis and outcome. We described the in-patient referrals of patients suffering from the psychiatric effects of organic states and compared the symptomatology and mortality between those with the Acute and Chronic varieties. METHODS: 59 patients referred to our Consultation-Liaison (C-L) Psychiatry services and given a clinical diagnosis of OBS were selected over a 6-month period. Psychiatric and cognitive abnormalities and treatment regimes were recorded and fatality rates determined. Information regarding their condition 24 months after their index hospitalization was recorded. All data were entered into a proforma and analyzed after exclusion. RESULTS: The mean duration of detecting the symptoms by the physician was 3.52 days. The presence of a premorbid psychiatric illness had no influence on the clinical presentation but did on the mortality of patients with OBS (p = 0.029).Patients with the Acute syndrome had significantly more symptom resolution as compared to those with the Chronic syndrome (p = 0.001) but mortalityrates did not differ. Elderly patients and those with symptom resolution upon discharge did not show statistically significant higher mortality rates. The most popular combination of treatment was that of a low-dose neuroleptic and a benzodiazepine (34.7%). The need for maintenance treatment was not significantly different in any group, even in those with a past history of a functional disorder. CONCLUSION: Other than the Acute group having a significantly better outcome in terms of symptom resolution, our findings suggest that there was no significant difference in the clinical presentation between those with Acute or Chronic OBS. Mortality-wise, there was also no difference between the Acute and Chronic syndromes, nor was there any difference between the elderly and the younger group. There was also no significant difference in the need for continued treatment in both groups."}, {"Title": "Whole systems working and acute inpatient psychiatry: an exploratory study.", "Abstract": "The concept of 'whole system' working is fundamental to contemporary policy and consequently to practice and service development within UK mental health services. This paper reports on an exploratory study of the meaning of the 'whole system' to staff working within adult mental health services in North Wales, conducted within a broader practice development project. A focus group was used to collect data from a multiprofessional group drawn from two acute inpatient wards, Community Mental Health Teams (CMHTs) and an assertive outreach team. Thematic analysis generated three themes central to effective whole system working in adult mental health services. Discussion on the efficacy of the whole system gave rise to an understanding that this whole system varies in its effectiveness in responding to people with differing clinical presentations. Furthermore, it appears that under certain circumstances, the whole system may work to shift responsibility in order to manage worker's anxiety more adroitly than, for example, working creatively to respond to people's needs. The paper concludes that whilst by no means exhaustive or complete, these three themes enable critical reflection, discussion and identification of practice development challenges that may facilitate more effective whole system working and better services in North Wales and possibly in other settings."}, {"Title": "[MR-based methods of the functional imaging of the central nervous system].", "Abstract": "This review presents the basic principles of functional imaging of the central nervous system utilizing magnetic resonance imaging.

Of the total sample, 1.6% were gambling at problem levels, and a further 1.2% were gambling at probable pathological levels in the past year. Inspection of gambling patterns by SOGS-R score failed to reveal a clear and consistent distinction between problem gambling and probable pathological gambling. Finally, examination of item distribution revealed consistent trends of both over and under endorsement of certain items.

CRS are a group of primitive reflexes that are present in the neonate but become inhibited as the infant central nervous system (CNS) develops, only to later re-emerge in the context of CNS disease. The clinical elicitation and interpretation of each CRS is described with reference to its neurobiology. The prevalence of CRS in schizophrenia, affective disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia and other neuropsychiatric illness allows for their use in the clinical management of these patients, including diagnostic assessment, treatment monitoring and prognosis.\nA number of issues complicate their interpretation in neuropsychiatric illness, including the apparent high base rate of some CRS in non-clinical populations, their increasing prevalence with age, lack of specificity and uncertainty over what constitutes an 'abnormal' response. In some circumstances, CRS may assist in diagnostic differentiation and illness staging."}, {"Title": "Dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP-2) gene and association to deficit and nondeficit schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "A previous study has shown an association between the *2236T > C allele polymorphism of the dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP-2) gene and schizophrenia in a Japanese sample [Nakata et al. (2003); Biological Psychiatry 53:571-576]. DRP-2 is an important molecule in guiding neuronal development and its gene is located in 8p21, a chromosomal region that was previously shown to have significant linkage to schizophrenia and to several deficit symptoms of schizophrenia. We compared the frequency of the DRP-2 *2236T > C polymorphism between subjects with (n = 117) and without (n = 72) schizophrenia, and then further evaluated whether the association was specific for the deficit (n = 24) and nondeficit (n = 93) forms of schizophrenia. In both Caucasians and African-Americans, the C allele occurred more frequently in schizophrenia cases than controls, with this difference achieving statistical significance in Caucasians (C allele frequency: 42.0% in cases vs. 25.0% in controls, P = 0.014) but not African Americans (52.6% in cases vs. 50.0% in controls, P = 0.93). In Caucasians, the frequency of the C allele was significantly higher in both the deficit (allele frequency 53.3%, P = 0.009) and nondeficit (39.2%, P =0.050) forms of schizophrenia compared to controls (allele frequency 25.0%). We conclude that the DRP-2 *2236 C allele may mark another polymorphism in DRP-2, or in a nearby gene, that may influence susceptibility to schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Can telepsychiatry replace in-person psychiatric assessments? A review and meta-analysis of comparison studies.", "Abstract": "The authors conducted a review and meta-analysis of the literature comparing telepsychiatry with \"in-person\" psychiatric assessments.\nApproximately 380 studies on telepsychiatry published between 1956 and 2002 were identified using MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and cross-referenced bibliographies. Of these, 14 studies with an N > 10 compared telepsychiatry with in-person psychiatry (I-P) using objective assessment instruments or satisfaction instruments. Three of these studies compared high bandwidth (HB) with low bandwidth (LB) telepsychiatry.\nFourteen studies of 500 patients met inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Telepsychiatry was found to be similar to I-P for the studies using objective assessments. Effect sizes were on average quite small, suggesting no difference between telepsychiatry and I-P. Bandwidth was found to be a significant moderator. Three moderators were tested, effect sizes remained largely heterogeneous, and further analyses are needed to determine the direction of effect. There was no difference between I-P and telepsychiatry between the HB and LB groups, although there are anecdotal data suggesting that HB was slightly superior for assessments requiring detailed observation of subjects.\nOut of a large telepsychiatry literature published over the past 40+ years, only a handful of studies have attempted to compare telepsychiatry with I-P directly using standardized assessment instruments that permit meaningful comparisons. However, in those studies, the current meta-analysis concludes there is no difference in accuracy or satisfaction between the two modalities. Over the next few years, we expect telepsychiatry to replace I-P in certain research and clinical situations."}, {"Title": "[Notes on the care of mentally ill residents in nursing homes in the Uelzen county district].", "Abstract": "From 1999 to 2001 the \"Centre of Applied Health Sciences\" (University of Luneburg) carried out a research project in cooperation with the Psychiatric Hospital Hacklingen in Luneburg and the department of social psychiatry and psychotherapy of the Hanover College of Medicine. The project covered the prevalence of mental disorders among the residents of nursing and geriatric homes in the district of Uelzen including different aspects of medical, psychiatric and nursing care. The research was based on a survey including all residents of these institutions. The response rate was 925 of a total of 1,100 residents. Results showed that three-quarters of the residents had considerable and different psychiatric symptoms and that almost half of the residents suffered from symptoms of dementia. The provision of health care as well as nursing care for these residents are considerably deficient. Care facilities are hardly of therapeutical standard and guidelines. This refers in particular to treatment with psychoactive drugs. The (few) comparable studies show that -- with the exception of some pilot projects -- the situation in the district of Uelzen may be similar to that in other regions of Germany."}, {"Title": "Bipolar mixed states and their treatment.", "Abstract": "Bipolar mixed states remain a nosologic dilemma, diagnostic challenge and neglected area of therapeutic research. While the outcome of mixed states is generally poorer than that of pure manic and depressive episodes, little is known about how to treat such a condition. The aim of this report is to investigate the results of clinical trials, including mixed bipolar patients, in order to provide some hints on the efficacy of the different compounds on this specific subpopulation. As a result of this research, it becomes clear that only dysphoric mania has been reasonably addressed in clinical trials, and unfortunately very little is known about the treatment of other mixed states. There is some indirect evidence that mixed mania may be more responsive to anticonvulsants than to lithium. Divalproate, and to a lesser extent carbamazepine, may be used either in monotherapy or as adjuncts to lithium. Use of other anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, topiramate or zonisamide is not yet supported by controlled data. The use of antidepressants is largely discouraged, as they may worsen this condition. On the other hand, atypical antipsychotics may be effective and safe either in monotherapy or in combination with lithium or valproate. Further research is urgently needed in this neglected area of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Pastoral psychology, spiritual counseling in dentistry.

A percentage of 44% of the hospitalised patients indicated a need of pastoral counseling during the treatment time. In the field of psychiatry and psychotherapy the percentage of the need of religious care (pastoral psychology, pastoral counseling) may be even higher.

Key applications in neurology, psychiatry, psychopharmacology, and sports, behavior or rehabilitation medicine make it desirable to improve step detecting devices. Several pedometer or wrist actigraphy monitors exist today, but are insensitive or confounded by movement style, which may vary for different diagnoses and applications. Presented is an algorithm that detects, classifies and counts steps related to walking, running and shuffling motion. Data is recorded using a novel ambulatory monitoring system (LifeShirt, VivoMetrics, Inc., Ventura, CA, USA) which captures breathing information from respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) sensors embedded in a light garment, and acceleration signals from a dual axis accelerometer attached close to the center of body mass. The vertical accelerometer axis measures upward acceleration generated by walking and running, while the other axis measures movement common with shuffling gait. Since these signals often contain noise and artifact due to soft tissue movement or external vibrations they are filtered and autocorrelated using unbiased estimates. The autocorrelation coefficients allow for clearer detection and classification of the cyclic motion during walking, running and shuffling movements. The algorithm is tested during various levels of exercise in healthy individuals and patients suffering from Parkinson disease, which is often characterized by shuffling gait. The results demonstrate an effective locomotor-monitoring algorithm that can produce accurate estimates of frequency and intensity of steps and shuffles and help classify daily locomotor activities."}, {"Title": "An international comparative study on the reliability and validity of the attitudes towards aggression scale.", "Abstract": "One of the factors known to be associated with the management of patient aggression is the attitude of staff members towards the aggressive behaviour of patients. The construct validity of an instrument measuring the attitudes of staff towards inpatient aggression in psychiatry was evaluated in this international multi-centre study. Factor analysis and simultaneous component analysis were performed with data from a convenience sample of 1769 psychiatric nurses working in psychiatric hospitals and student nurses from nursing schools. The samples were recruited by fellow researchers in their home country. The original 32-item version (POAS) was reduced to 18 items comprising five attitude scales with solid psychometric properties. The types of attitudes were labelled offensive, communicative, destructive, protective and intrusive. The format of the correlations between the types of attitudes suggested the existence of two basic underlying divergent domains in the scale. The 'communication' and 'protection' scale components on the one hand, and the 'offence', 'destruction' and 'intrusion' components on the other. The five types of attitude proved to be invariant across samples from five European countries.

Reminiscence groups typically involve group meetings in which participants are encouraged to talk about past events at least once a week. Life review typically involves individual sessions, in which the person is guided chronologically through life experiences, encouraged to evaluate them, and may produce a life story book. Family care-givers are increasingly involved in reminiscence therapy. Reminiscence therapy is one of the most popular psychosocial interventions in dementia care, and is highly rated by staff and participants. There is some evidence to suggest it is effective in improving mood in older people without dementia. Its effects on mood, cognition and well-being in dementia are less well understood.\nThe objective of the review is to assess the effects of reminiscence therapy for older people with dementia and their care-givers.\nThe trials were identified from a search of the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 4 May 2004 using the term \"reminiscence\". The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycLIT, CINAHL) and many ongoing trials databases and is regularly updated. We contacted specialists in the field and also searched relevant Internet sites. We hand-searched Aging and Mental Health, the Gerontologist, Journal of Gerontology, Current Opinion in Psychiatry, Current Research in Britain: Social Sciences, British Psychological Society conference proceedings and Reminiscence database.\nRandomised controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials of reminiscence therapy for dementia.\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.\nFive trials are included in the review, but only four trials with a total of 144 participants had extractable data. The results were statistically significant for cognition (at follow-up), mood (at follow-up) and on a measure of general behavioural function (at the end of the intervention period). The improvement on cognition was evident in comparison with both no treatment and social contact control conditions. Care-giver strain showed a significant decrease for care-givers participating in groups with their relative with dementia, and staff knowledge of group members' backgrounds improved significantly. No harmful effects were identified on the outcome measures reported.\nWhilst four suitable randomized controlled trials looking at reminiscence therapy for dementia were found, several were very small studies, or were of relatively low quality, and each examined different types of reminiscence work. Although there are a number of promising indications, in view of the limited number and quality of studies, the variation in types of reminiscence work reported and the variation in results between studies, the review highlights the urgent need for more and better designed trials so that more robust conclusions may be drawn."}, {"Title": "Electroconvulsive therapy: a selected review.", "Abstract": "Since its introduction in 1938, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has remained an important treatment for selected serious neuropsychiatric illnesses and continues to be one of the most effective treatments in psychiatry.

For this review, the authors relied heavily on the database from the APA Task Force Report on ECT (2001), updated with additional searches of computerized literature databases for the period 1999-2003. The review is necessarily a selective one, given the exponential growth of literature in the field. The authors attempt to summarize key areas of ECT practice, informed by relevant research findings and expert consensus when applicable. The authors also point out areas of controversy and gaps in our present knowledge.

Severity and chronicity of depression and higher levels of thought suppression were associated with higher depressive symptoms six months after treatment. Findings are consistent with research suggesting that severity and chronicity of depression predict poor clinical outcome. In addition, these results provide preliminary evidence that the tendency to cope with unwanted thoughts by deliberate attempts to not experience such thoughts may be an important pre-treatment predictor of outcome among depressed older adults.

A modified focus group methodology was used in this exploratory process. Groups were conducted over a two-day period, with five sessions lasting 1-1.5 hours each. An adapted nominal group method was used to record themes arising from the group discussion, and these themes were used in a grounded theory approach to generate explanations for delayed recognition of and response to dementia. The overarching theme that arose from the focus groups was movement, which had three different expressions. These were: population movement and its consequences for localities, services and professional experience; the journey of the person with dementia along the disease process; and the referral pathway to access services and support. Change is the core issue in dementia care, with multiple pathways of change that need to be understood at clinical and organisational levels. Practitioners and people with dementia are engaged in managing emotional, social and physical risks, making explicit risk management a potentially important component of dementia care. The boundary between generalist and specialist services is a particular problem, with great potential for dysfunctionality.

Participating psychiatrists were representative for Swiss private psychiatry with regards to gender distribution and region of practice.\nOverall, 8425 patients were assessed in our survey. Of these, 905 patients (10.7%) received a diagnosis of schizophrenic psychoses, of whom 733 details on antipsychotic treatment were documented. 73.1% of these patients received second generation antipsychotics. Most private psychiatrists prescribed antipsychotic monotherapy and maintained antipsychotic treatment according to recommendation from international guidelines. Almost half of these patients had a history of medication non-adherence, with non-compliance being the most frequent reason.\nThe findings of this survey suggest that Swiss private psychiatrists prescribe according to international guidelines in terms of drug choice as well as maintenance treatment. Moreover they show low rates of polypharmacy and comedication practice as compared to their colleagues in other European countries.

Active duty service, older age, single marital status, and a primary diagnosis of a psychotic or mood disorder were all significantly associated with longer hospital stays. Primary diagnosis of an adjustment or personality disorder was associated with a shorter stay. Taking into account these variables, lengths of stay for active duty personnel averaged 4.00 +/- 0.39 days longer than for equivalent civilian admissions.

The three core individual manualized therapies (IPSRT, cognitive therapy, and FFT) have all developed specific models for use in BP. Colom et al's group psychoeducation model also has a clearly developed rationale and format, and it allows individuals to share their views of BP with others, to learn adaptive coping strategies from the other 8 to 12 members of the group, and to have regular contact with an expert therapist. Careful review of the four more extended and comprehensive approaches and the brief technique-driven interventions demonstrates that the effective therapies incorporate one or more of the modules show in Box 1. At present,the choice between the four extended models is more likely to be dictated by patient choice or the availability of a trained therapist. The technique-driven interventions are briefer than the specific therapies (about 6-9 sessions compared with about 20-22 sessions) and usually offer a generic, fixed treatment package targeted at a circumscribed issue such as medication adherence or managing early symptoms of relapse. These brief interventions can be delivered by a less-skilled or less-experienced professional than the specific model. They potentially seem to be useful in day-to-day clinical practice in general adult psychiatry settings; additional larger-scale, randomized trials should be encouraged. Given the reduction in relapse rates and hospitalizations associated with the use of psychologic therapy as an adjunct to medication, it is likely that these approaches will prove to be clinically and cost effective. They may provide a significant improvement in the quality of life of individuals with BP (and indirectly to that of their partners and family members). Brief,evidence-based therapies represent an important component of good clinical practice in the management of BP. Studies of a comprehensive, whole-system approach to the collaborative psychobiosocial management of BP are being undertaken in the United States. If these approaches improve the quality and continuity of care for individuals with BP, they will have further implications for the delivery and organization of mental health services. The number and variety of trials of psychosocial interventions is exciting for researchers and clinicians interested in BP. Enthusiasm for advocating these approaches should be tempered by an acknowledgment that the trials undertaken so far largely demonstrate efficacy in selected samples of patients treated at specialist BP clinics or psychologic treatment research centers. Translating efficacy into effectiveness requires evidence that the approaches used in the treatment trials are equally beneficial when used by the wider therapist community treating patients seen routinely in non-specialist or nonresearch centers. These patients often have multiple problems or complex presentations that preclude their involvement in pharmacologic or psychologic treatment studies, but monitoring the outcomes of these representative samples will be important in determining the true place of psychologic approaches in the management of BP. Large-scale studies are now underway on both sides of the Atlantic (the Medical Research Council study in the United Kingdom and the STEP-BD project in the United States). These trials are likely to answer basic questions about the benefits and limitations of psychologic therapies in the acute and maintenance treatment of BP in the clinical realm and will increase understanding of the effectiveness-versus-efficacy question."}, {"Title": "Treatment of bipolar depression.", "Abstract": "This article discusses current practices in the treatment of bipolar depression.

Five psychiatric units are part of the Federal Correctional Services. Nursing practice in forensic psychiatry opens up new horizons in nursing. This complex professional nursing practice involves the coupling of two contradictory socio-professional mandates: to punish and to provide care.\nThe purpose of this article is to present the results of a grounded theory doctoral study realized in a multi-level security psychiatric ward of the Canadian Federal Penitentiary System. The theoretical work of the late French philosopher, Michel Foucault, and those of sociologist, Erving Goffman, are used to illuminate the qualitative data that emerged from the author's fieldwork.\nA Foucauldian perspective allows us to understand the way forensic psychiatric nursing is involved in the governance of mentally ill criminals through a vast array of power techniques (sovereign, disciplinary, and pastoral) which posited nurses as \"subjects of power\". These nurses are also \"objects of power\" in that nursing practice is constrained by formal and informal regulations of the penitentiary context.\nAs an object of \"governmental technologies\", the nursing staff becomes the body onto which a process of conforming to the customs of the correctional milieu is dictated and inscribed.

Means of direct costs (given in Euro and referred to Deutsche Mark prices in 2000) were computed, and t-tests and bootstrap-procedures were used for group comparison. Furthermore, missing and sensitivity analyses were conducted.\nPatients in the acute day hospital caused mean direct health care costs of 12 401 per person within the entire period assessed. Thus, their cost level falls below the mean costs of inpatient care (15,924 euro per person) by 22.1 %. Missing analyses showed no selection effects on cost results caused by patients who could not be assessed at all defined time-points. Costs for inpatient and day care services were the most sensitive parameters for maintaining the statistically significant differences of cost means demonstrated between the two study groups.\nFor German-speaking countries, this study shows for the first time that acute day care -- which has been demonstrated to be clinically at least as effective as inpatient care - is the less expensive option if these two settings are comparatively assessed."}, {"Title": "[Kinematic movement analyses and their application in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "There is a long tradition to develop valid instruments for the exact assessment of psycho-motor dysfunctions in psychiatry. However, progress is hampered by the complexity of emotionally driven movements in psychiatric patients. Methods used up to now either remains unspecific due to only qualitative measurements or focus on the neurophysiological aspects too much. Thus, the results accomplished so far are only very general unspecific concerning different groups of psychiatric patients. In this paper, two own methods are presented which are aimed to avoid the two poles above mentioned. Kinematic analyses of facial expressions as well as handwriting movements provide quantitative and quite specific informations about psycho-motor dysfunctions of psychiatric patients and the effects of psychotropic substances. Thus, these methods are well suitable for relating them to other neurobiological parameters in order to contribute to the pathophysiological understanding of psycho-motor symptoms in psychiatric patients."}, {"Title": "Recidivism in medication-noncompliant serious juvenile offenders with bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "To determine whether the recidivism rate varies for adolescent serious juvenile offenders with bipolar disorder in response to compliance with antimanic medication.\nProbation records were reviewed for all adolescents (N = 31) released during a 1-year period (April 1, 1993-March 31, 1994) from a county juvenile corrections treatment facility who had DSM-III-R bipolar disorder, were stabilized on medication, and had agreed to continue treatment at an adolescent psychiatry clinic. New offenses and probation violations committed during the 12-month period after release were tallied. These recidivism records were then compared with medical records to ascertain whether these acts were committed while subjects were on (taking) or off (not taking) medication.\nThe number of serious offenses (felonies and misdemeanors) was significantly reduced while subjects were on medication (4 offenses in 2992 days) versus off medication (39 offenses in 6108 days) (p < .0001). The off-medication rate of offending was 4.8 times higher than the on-medication rate. Probation violations were also significantly reduced while subjects were on medication (p < .001).\nCompliance with prescribed antimanic medication can markedly decrease recidivism in serious juvenile delinquents with bipolar disorder."}, {"Title": "Survey of chronic pain practice by anesthesiologists in Canada.", "Abstract": "To describe the pattern of chronic pain practice (CPP) among anesthesiologists in Canada.\nFollowing hospital Ethics Committee approval, a detailed postal questionnaire was sent to all active members of the Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society. A second mailing was conducted two months later.\nThe overall response rate was 53%. While 38% of responding anesthesiologists were involved in CPP, in the majority of cases, this accounted for less than 20% of their clinical time. Thirty percent of those involved in CPP had previous training in pain management. The types of CPP included nerve blocks (84%) and pharmacological treatment (60%) in non-cancer pain (85%) and cancer pain (50%) patients. Ten percent and 28% of anesthesiologists were involved in research and teaching respectively while 26% were affiliated with a multidisciplinary clinic. The healthcare professions that anesthesiologists had access to or were directly working with in their practice were as follows: acupuncture (18%), nursing (36%), psychology (28%), psychiatry (35%) and physiotherapy (58%). Epidural steroid injection was the most commonly practiced intervention (82%). This was followed by trigger point injection (70%), stellate ganglion block (61%), occipital nerve block (60%) and lumbar sympathetic block (50%). Practice of interventional procedures was highly diverse. Seventy percent of anesthesiologists prescribed opioids as part of their CPP. However, half of them never incorporated an opioid agreement with patients. Opioids were most commonly used in the sustained release form.\nApproximately one-third of anesthesiologists surveyed incorporate chronic pain in their practice and their pattern of practice is widely diversified."}, {"Title": "[Role of personality in depression of the elderly: difference between early and late life depression].", "Abstract": "Personality disorders have been implicated in the occurrence of depression in the elderly. The main purpose of this study was to assess the role of personality disorders in depression of the elderly and to distinguish between early and late onset depression. The study included 48 subjects over 65 years of age from a department of psychiatry, who suffered from a major depressive episode according to the criteria of the DSM-III-R, without bipolar characteristics. The patients were examined at two different times. At the first interview, depression was assessed by the mini-GDS and the CES-D scales, and a cognitive disorder was ruled out by the Mini-Mental State Examination. The patients were then classified in two groups according to the time of the first occurrence of depression, before (early onset depression) or after (late onset depression) 65 years of age. A second evaluation was performed after the cure of the depression. The patients' personality was then assessed using the International Personality Disorder Examination, in its VKP French-translated version, which evaluates personality disorders as defined by the criteria of the DSM-III-R and the ICD-10. The frequency of personality disorders was higher in patients with early-onset depression rather than in those with late onset depression. The most frequent personality disorder was avoiding personality (Cluster C) according to categorical as well as dimensional assessment. \"Dependant personality\" (Cluster C) was also quite often associated with early-onset depression. However this results should be confirmed by a larger study."}, {"Title": "Substance P receptor antagonists in psychiatry: rationale for development and therapeutic potential.", "Abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that substance P (SP) and its receptor (neurokinin [NK]-1 receptor [NK1R]) might play an important role in the modulation of stress-related, affective and/or anxious behaviour. First, SP and NK1R are expressed in brain regions that are involved in stress, fear and affective response (e.g. amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus and frontal cortex). Second, the SP content in these areas changes upon application of stressful stimuli. Third, the central administration of SP produces a range of fear-related behaviours. In addition, the SP/NK1R system shows significant spatial overlap with neurotransmitters such as serotonin and noradrenaline (norepinephrine), which are known to be involved in the regulation of stress, mood and anxiety. Therefore, it was hypothesised that blockade of the NK1R might have anxiolytic as well as antidepressant effects. Preclinical studies investigating the effects of genetic or pharmacological NK1R inactivation on animal behaviour in assays relevant to depression and anxiety revealed that the behavioural changes resemble those seen with reference antidepressant or anxiolytic drugs. Furthermore, antagonism or genetic inactivation of the NK1R causes alterations in serotonin and norepinephrine neuronal transmission that are likely to contribute to the antidepressant/anxiolytic activity of NK1R antagonists but that are--at least partially--distinct from those produced by established antidepressant drugs. This underlines the conceivable unique mechanism of action of this new class of compounds. In three independent clinical trials with three different compounds (aprepitant [MK-869], L-759274 and CP-122721), an antidepressant effect of NK1R antagonists could be demonstrated. These results, however, have been challenged by recent failed studies with aprepitant. There are numerous indications from preclinical studies that, in addition to SP and NK1R, other neurokinins and/or neurokinin receptors might also be involved in the modulation of stress-related behaviour and that exclusive blockade of the NK1R might not be sufficient to produce consistent anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. One such candidate is the neurokinin-2 receptor (NK2R), and clinical trials to assess the antidepressant effects of NK2R antagonists are currently underway. Of special interest might also be substances that block more than one receptor type such as NK1/2R antagonists or NK1/2/3R antagonists. These compounds may be more efficacious in antagonising the effects of SP than compounds that only block the NK1R."}, {"Title": "[Epilepsy--a review of its development in the world and in Croatia].", "Abstract": "Development of studies in epilepsy is presented, primarily in Croatia and briefly with regard to the world. The first epileptology available to the author were those published in Liecnicki viestnik in 1887 by D. Forenbacher (1896), by J. Tyrman, and in 1900 by F. Gutschy. The names Julius, Lopasi\u0107, Jelasi\u0107 appeared from 1937 to 1943. In 1953, initiated by Lopasi\u0107 in cooperation with Julius and Glaser, the journal Neuropsihijatrija was founded, dealing with neurology, psychiatry and peripheral fields. Thus began a new era in publishing in the field of epilepsy. The first practice for epilepsy was set up in 1952 by Dogan and Hajnsek, assisted by Lopasi\u0107, when the first EEG device (Medcraft) became available through UNRRA. By 1956 it expanded into a Clinic for Epilepsy, led by Hajnsek, soon becoming a meeting place for all those interested in epilepsy in children and adults. After two wars of work, the first locally designed EEG devices, produced by Santi\u0107 and Kolaj, were supplied to six laboratories in 1961 throughout Croatia. In 1962 a section for EEG and Clinical Neurophysiology was founded at the Medical Association of Croatia. That year the Clinic for Epilepsy became the Centre for Epilepsy. In 1964 Croatian Section for EEG and Clinical Neurophysiology was founded in Ohrid, which became very active, organizing a number of meetings and ten symposia throughout former Yugoslavia. In 1972, the Croatian League for providing help to those suffering from epilepsy was founded, functioning independently, and organizing meetings, symposia and participating in the education of what by then had become a significant number of epileptologists treating children and adults, indirectly participating in the organization of more than seventy EEG laboratories throughout Croatia. During the 1990s, the Croatian League against Epilepsy also gained its independence and, with the Croatian Society for Epilepsy, in 1998 became a member of the ILAE and IBE (International Federation League against Epilepsy and International Bureau for Epilepsy). Both organizations are involved in the global campaign against epilepsy, entitled \"Out of the Shadows\", organizing meetings on the classification of epilepsy, diagnosis, and use of new anti-epileptics alongside those already existing. By giving lectures in kindergartens, schools, on radio and television, they are providing assistance to those suffering from the disease, helping them deal with their socioeconomic problems, in schooling, employment, marriage, having children, appearing before courts, handling themselves in road traffic, and in everyday life."}, {"Title": "Effects on processes and costs of care associated with the addition of an internist to an inpatient psychiatry team.", "Abstract": "This study examined the effects of collaboration between an internist and psychiatrists on the processes and cost of care among psychiatric inpatients.\nA randomized controlled study was performed on the psychiatric inpatient units of an academic medical center. All inpatients who were admitted to the units between March 2001 and January 2002 were asked to participate in the study. Patients in the intervention group met with an internist who participated in their care by communicating with the patients' primary care physicians, assessing needs, updating appropriate health maintenance services, managing chronic and acute medical problems, and attending hospital work rounds. Patients in the usual-care group received usual care. The processes of care were measured by examining 17 categories that involved assessment of needs, coordination of care, and completion of health maintenance services. Resource use was measured by examining hospital charges and length of stay.\nA total of 139 adults participated in the study: 55 were in the intervention group and 84 were in the usual-care group. Patients in the intervention group showed significant improvement in 12 of the 17 categories of the processes of care.

The clinically indicated level of care and actual level-of-care decisions were studied independently, by using multivariate logistic regression analyses. The decision-making process was divided into three consecutive steps: evaluation of clinically indicated inpatient or outpatient level of care (step 1), voluntary or involuntary admission (step 2), and actual admission of patients for whom voluntary admission was indicated (step 3).\nEach step was determined by separate factors. Specifically, clinically indicated admission (step 1) was associated with family or friends' desire for admission (odds ratio [OR]=3.7), previous admissions (OR=2.9), symptom severity (OR=2.7), and personality disorder (OR=.4). Involuntary admission (step 2) was associated with lack of motivation (OR=5.7), symptom severity (OR=3.7), time of referral (OR=3.5) and danger to self or others (OR=2.7). Actual voluntary admission (step 3) was associated mainly with bed availability (OR=8.7). The overall percentage of correctly predicted cases was 82 percent for all steps in the decision process.\nThis study showed that each step in the admission decision process is determined by a unique set of variables and provided evidence that contextual factors influence decision making.

This study investigated the reliability of the GAF and analyzed certain factors that affect measurement errors when the scale is used by regular psychiatric staff.\nEighty-one raters from various psychiatric outpatient clinics rated eight case vignettes. Interrater reliability was assessed by using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and factors associated with reliability were analyzed by using raters' unique residual values.\nThe results showed that staff who are responsible for assessing first-time patients at outpatient psychiatric clinics and making diagnoses are using the GAF with satisfactory reliability (ICC(1,1)=.81). The factors associated with reliability were raters' subjective attitude toward the GAF and motivation to use the scale and other measurement instruments in psychiatry.\nGAF ratings made by an individual rater can be used to measure changes and outcomes at the group level. However, the measurement error is too large for assessment of change for an individual patient, in which case it might be necessary to use several raters. If raters are positively inclined to use rating instruments, measurement errors are minimized and reliability is maximized."}, {"Title": "Subspecialization in psychiatry: third-generation programs.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry, unlike internal medicine, was slow to develop subspecialty certification.

Telemedicine has great potential for medical education. The principles of education are in congruence with those of telemedicine and can be closely integrated in the existing medical education system. Our experience of telemedicine as a medical education tool is based on video conferencing with SCB Medical College, Cuttack.

Impairment of memory is one of the most disabling aspects of many neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, strokes, tumors, head trauma, hypoxia (reduced exposure of tissue to oxygen), cardiac surgery, malnutrition, attention deficit disorder, depression, anxiety, medication side-effects, and normal aging. This memory loss often impairs the patient's normal daily activities, profoundly affecting both the patients and their families. Research in memory began with neuropsychological studies of patients with focal brain lesions and now includes new methods such as PET (positron emission tomography, where the decay of an injected radioactive element or drug creates an image) and functional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging, where hydrogen atoms are polarized by a magnet and the summation of their spinning energy creates an image). Event-related methodologies have provided us with more refined and improved classification systems. Rather than conceptualizing memory as \"short-term\" and \"long-term,\" we now think of memory as a collection of mental abilities that use different systems within the brain.

The \"theory of mind\" is a useful construct for bridging \"mind\" and \"brain\" in the treatment of personality disorders.\nSevere personality disorders are best understood and treated without \"either-or\" dichotomies of brain and mind.

Furthermore, neonatal complications in the children with ADHD were associated with worse CBCL total and externalizing scores and with poorer performance on the CPT.\nThese results suggest that neonatal complications are probably a nonshared environmental risk factor that may be pathogenic in children with ADHD."}, {"Title": "[The diagnostic validity of screening tests and laboratory markers in alcohol use disorders].", "Abstract": "To determine the validity of screening tests and markers suggested in the early detection of alcohol use disorders.\nMale patients aged 20-65 were recruited from a psychiatry clinic.

The aim of this article is to report and discuss current scientific knowledge on this topic. The different steps associated with coercion contribute, along with the illness, to the degree of stress experienced by the patient and might compromise his/her level of adherence to the treatment offered. Clinicians need to consider three dimensions: the coercion applied, the legal status and the subjective feeling of coercion. Pressure that is symbolically negative, positive or legal is exerted on the patients, thereby raising questions about the development of alternatives to the use of coerced treatment. The introduction of the advance directives to Swiss cantonal laws could give rise to different forms of collaboration that are more acceptable to patients."}, {"Title": "Discrepancies between self-reported years of education and estimated reading level: potential implications for neuropsychologists.", "Abstract": "Current standard neuropsychology practice is to examine normative sample performance for systematic influences of demographic variables and then to correct for these influences. The most commonly examined demographic variables are age, gender, and years of education, and current normative databases frequently take these into consideration. However, there is a literature to suggest that self-reported years of educational attainment may not be an accurate reflection of some patients' level of performance and may actually overpredict grade estimates based on reading level. Many of these studies have focused on older samples of individuals who were free of neurological or psychiatric symptoms. In this study, a younger sample (average age = 44.5) of African American (N = 62) and Caucasian (N = 133) patients referred to an outpatient psychiatry unit was examined. Results suggest that the prior findings of a significant discrepancy between self-reported years of education and Wide Range Achievement Test-3rd Edition Reading Recognition performance hold for a younger sample with a broad range of clinical diagnoses. How these findings might influence clinical practice are discussed."}, {"Title": "Reasons for admission and their implications for the nature of acute inpatient psychiatric nursing.", "Abstract": "The purpose of acute inpatient psychiatric care, and nurses' role within that, are in need of clarification and restatement in order to provide a framework for practice, education, research and development. Inpatient psychiatry has suffered from a paucity of research in recent years. In addition, being a complex system, involving multiple professions with differing ideologies, means that widely accepted succinct descriptions of its purpose are hard to achieve. Yet such a framework is essential to support positive attitudes to patients and for good staff-management relationships. Using an oblique strategy, this paper defines the function of acute inpatient psychiatry, and the role of psychiatric nurses, via a structured examination of the literature on reasons for admission to acute inpatient psychiatric wards. Seven such reasons were discovered and are described: dangerousness, assessment, medical treatment, severe mental disorder, self-care deficits, respite for carers, and respite for the patient. Acute inpatient psychiatric nurses are therefore: providing safety for the patient and others; collecting and communicating information about patients, giving and monitoring treatment; tolerating and managing disturbed behaviour; providing personal care; and managing an environment where patients can comfortably stay. The implications for psychiatric nursing are discussed."}, {"Title": "Medicine taking decisions: schizophrenia in comparison to asthma and epilepsy.", "Abstract": "This paper outlines a recent PhD study that explored factors underpinning decisions of people with schizophrenia regarding neuroleptic medicine taking. Relevant studies tend to be within the world view of psychiatry, resting on traditional concepts of compliance and insight. These studies examined schizophrenia outwith the context of other illnesses taking a snap shot view of medicine taking decision making, thus de-emphasizing its process. The chosen method of grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss 1967) overcomes these deficiencies. Stage 1 data arose from patient interviews, patients with asthma, epilepsy and schizophrenia contributed (n = 45), carers also sometimes contributed (n = 11), all three conditions being episodic disorders vulnerable to environmental stressors. Stage 2 develops from stage 1, mental health workers involved in the care of people with schizophrenia were interviewed, plus one asthma specialist and one epilepsy specialist (n = 16). Their views were compared to perspectives arising from the patient interviews and were included in the data, out of which an explanatory typology emerged. The three parts of the typology comprise the study's major categories and are labelled as: direct-reactive, deferential-compliant, and active discerning and optimizing. Active discerning and optimizing consists of two stages; experimental-reflective and consolidation. The core category of responsive resolution contains themes which run through all major categories."}, {"Title": "Changes in diagnosis, treatment, and clinical improvement among patients receiving telemedicine consultations.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine whether outpatient telemedicine specialty consultations to primary care clinicians result in changes in a patient's diagnosis, treatment management, and clinical outcomes. Medical records of patients who received two or more clinical telemedicine consultations in dermatology, psychiatry, and endocrinology were evaluated in a nonconcurrent retrospective analysis. Three indicators were used to measure changes in the processes of care and clinical outcomes: change in diagnosis, change in treatment, and patient clinical improvement. A retrospective review of 223 individual telemedicine patient medical records was conducted. Specialty telemedicine consultations were found to result in changes in diagnoses in 48% of the cases, changes in treatment therapy in 81.6% of the cases, and clinical improvement in 60.1%. These results are consistent with previous literature that has assessed changes in processes of care and outcomes from face-to-face specialty consultations in outpatient clinics. Changes in diagnosis and treatment therapy were found to be associated with clinical improvement with odds ratios (ORs) of 2.66 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.47-4.83) and 11.22 (95% CI: 4.49-31.48), respectively.

Development and clinical validation of the Parental-Representation-Screening-Questionnaire (PRSQ)].", "Abstract": "The Parental-Representation-Screening-Questionnaire (PRSQ) is a new instrument designed to asses how children and adolescents evaluate their relationship with their parents. The aim of the questionnaire is to assess those aspects in the child-parent relationship that are crucial for a psychopathological risk. Conceptually, the PRSQ is based on cognitive self theory and systemic family theory. The PRSQ consists of 8 scales (36 items) for each parent: \"freedom of decision\", \"emotional burden by the parents\", \"fears / overprotection\", \"conflict\", \"hostility / indifference\", \"aid for the parents\", \"punishment\", and \"support from the parents''. A clinic-referred consecutive sample of 152 patients of a Berlin child and adolescent psychiatry, aged 10 to 18 years, were surveyed. Adverse educational and psychosocial family factors were assessed by clinicians according to the fifths axis of the multiaxial classification system (MAS, Dilling et al. 2000). The internal reliability for 13 of the 16 scales ranges from .90 to .72. Factor analyses confirmed the factorial independence of six of the eight scales separately for mother and father. Moreover, adolescent girls reported significantly worse relations to both parents on five of the 16 scales than boys. Furthermore we found concordant correlations with the clinician's diagnosis of adverse educational and psychosocial family situations. The present results confirm the PRSQ as an economic and discriminating instrument to assess the representation of parent-child relation for clinical and for scientific purposes."}, {"Title": "[The practice guideline 'Depressive disorder' (first revision) from the Dutch College of General Practitioners; a response from the perspective of psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The first revision of the Dutch guidelines for the treatment of depressive disorders by general practitioners adapted the international psychiatric nomenclature for the diagnosis of depressive disorders. This enhances collaboration between general practitioners and psychiatrists. The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in this guideline is an advantage compared to the earlier version. The distinction between the indication for cognitive therapy and for antidepressant treatment is not very clear in this guideline. Overall the guideline represents a scientific and conservative stance in the treatment of depressed patients, which is commendable. The use of target plasma level concentrations with tricyclic antidepressants, better guidelines for the use of antidepressants or cognitive therapy, and the use of severity rating scales during treatment could further improve the next version of this guideline."}, {"Title": "Behavioral and cardiovascular effects of 7.5% CO2 in human volunteers.", "Abstract": "The study of carbon dioxide (CO2) inhalation in psychiatry has a long and varied history, with recent interest in using inhaled CO2 as an experimental tool to explore the neurobiology and treatment of panic disorder. As a consequence, many studies have examined the panic-like response to the gas either using the single or double breath 35% CO2 inhalation or 5-7% CO2 inhaled for 15-20 min, or rebreathing 5% CO2 for a shorter time. However, this lower dose regime produces little physiological or psychological effects in normal volunteers. For this reason we have studied the effects of a higher concentration of CO2, 7.5%, given over 20 min. Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited to a double blind, placebo-controlled study where air and 7.5% CO2 were inhaled for 20 min. Cardiovascular measures and subjective ratings were obtained. When compared to air, inhaling 7.5% CO2 for 20 min increases systolic blood pressure and heart rate, indicating increased autonomic arousal. It also increases ratings of anxiety and fear and other subjective symptoms associated with an anxiety state. The inhalation of 7.5% CO2 for 20 min is safe for use in healthy volunteers and produces robust subjective and objective effects. It seems promising as an anxiety provocation test that could be beneficial in the study of the effects of anxiety on sustained performance, the discovery of novel anxiolytic agents, and the study of brain circuits and mechanisms of anxiety."}, {"Title": "The relationship of Kraepelian affective temperaments (as measured by TEMPS-I) to the tridimensional personality questionnaire (TPQ).", "Abstract": "There is considerable uncertainty in the current literature about the relationship between personality dimensions and affective temperaments.\nWe compared-in a non-ill 14-26-year-old Italian student population of 1010-the affective temperaments of classic psychiatry conceived as subaffective traits [and measured through the Temperament Assessment of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Interview Version (TEMPS-I) in the Akiskal and Mallya Operationalization] with Cloninger's revised Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) deriving from the experimental psychology tradition.\nThe Depressive Temperament (DT) and Harm Avoidance (HA), loaded positively on the same canonical variate, whereas the hyperthymic (HT) strongly, and Novelty Seeking (NS) moderately, loaded negatively. In contrast, the Cyclothymic Temperament (CT) loaded highly positively on a second variate, on which both Novelty Seeking strongly and Harm Avoidance moderately loaded positively. Reward Dependence (RD), Persistence (P), and Irritable Temperament (IT) did not significantly relate to any temperamental and personality constructs. At a subdimensional level of TPQ 'shyness with strangers', 'stoic rigidity', 'detachment', 'fear of uncertainty', 'reflection', and 'anticipatory worry' correlated best with the DT. 'Gregariousness', 'exploratory excitability', 'uninhibited optimism', 'attachment', 'confidence', 'extravagance', 'independence', 'vigor', and 'impulsiveness' correlated best with HT. Lastly, 'anticipatory worry', 'disorderliness', 'sentimentality', and 'fatigability' correlated best with CT.\nThe data provide concurrent validity to TEMPS-I and, as earlier suggested by Cloninger, indicate that (as expected) high HA and DT are related. High NS is both related to the HT and CT, and (somewhat unexpectedly), the CT is related to high HA. In a more theoretical vein, hyperthymic-novelty seeker can be predicted to be overrepresented among those with high achievement; on the other hand, a moody, restless disposition (a cyclothymic-harm avoidant type) may engage in outrageous behavior and be liable to negative affective arousal. We submit that these considerations could shed some light on the origin of socially adaptive behavior ('sunny' or sanguine types) on the one hand, and borderline conditions, anxious-hostile bipolarity ('dark' types) on the other."}, {"Title": "Effect of psychiatry liaison with general practitioners on depression severity in recently hospitalised cardiac patients: a randomised controlled trial.", "Abstract": "To evaluate the effect on depressive symptoms in cardiac patients of patient-specific advice to general practitioners regarding management of comorbid depression.\nA randomised controlled trial in four general hospitals in Adelaide, South Australia.\nPatients (n = 669) admitted to cardiology units for a range of cardiovascular conditions who were screened and assessed as being depressed according to the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).\nInpatient psychiatric review, followed by telephone case conferencing between specialist hospital staff and GPs to provide patient-specific information about the patient's depression and its management, educational material, and ongoing clinical support.\nLevel of depression severity at 12 months post-hospitalisation.\nOn the basis of intention to treat, intervention patients had lower rates of moderate to severe depression (CES-D > or = 27) after 12 months (25% v 35%, relative risk, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54-0.96, number needed to treat for benefit, 11).

Captive environments may interfere with these behavioral responses, and the resulting stress may alter many physiological parameters. Abnormal behaviors indicate that an animal is unable to adjust behaviorally to the captive environment and, hence, may be expressing abnormal physiology. Therefore, captive environments may affect the following aspects of an experiment: validity, by introducing abnormal animals into experiments; reliability, by increasing interindividual variation through the introduction of such individuals; and replicability, by altering the number and type of such individuals between laboratories. Thus, far from increasing variability, enrichment may actually improve validity, reliability, and replicability by reducing the number of abnormal animals introduced into experiments. In this article, the specific example of abnormal repetitive behaviors (ARBs) is explored. ARBs in captive animals appear to involve the same mechanisms as ARBs in human psychiatry, which reflect underlying abnormalities of brain function. ARBs are also correlated with a wide range of behavioral changes that affect experimental outcomes. Thus, ARBs in laboratory animals may compromise validity, reliability, and replicability, especially in behavioral experiments; and enrichments that prevent ARB may enhance validity, reliability, and replicability. Although many links in this argument have been tested experimentally, key issues still remain in the interpretation of these data. In particular, it is currently unclear (1) whether or not the differences in brain function seen in animals performing ARB are abnormal, (2) which common behavioral paradigms are affected by ARB, and (3) whether enrichment does indeed improve the quality of behavioral data. Ongoing and future work addressing these issues is outlined."}, {"Title": "Doctor-patient relationships in chronic illness: insights from forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Collaborative management of chronic illness is undermined by neglect of emotional and psychological factors in both the patient and doctor"}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The main innovation of the year 2004 was the introduction of a new, second-generation antipsychotic drug with a new mechanism of action (partial dopamine agonist), encouraging first clinical results, and an advantageous clinical tolerance profile.

Moreover, it does not arise out of this that the patient has come to terms with involuntary commitment after its completion. The need, then, to minimize the patient's perception of coercion while committed, becomes a very important matter which should be taken into account during treatment.

By interviewing him again it turned out that he had been swallowing multiple bent pins intending to commit suicide. Abdominal X-ray demonstrated at least 12 bent metallic pins in different segments of the gastrointestinal tract. Subsequently the young man was admitted to the local psychiatry department. All foreign bodies were excreted per vias naturales within a few days. This case shows that the ingestion of \"atypical\" foreign bodies needs very careful anamnesis.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and estimators of polypharmacy in psychiatric patients living in an area with very limited mental health resources.\nAll patients (n = 352) with mental disorders receiving psychotropic medication living in La Gomera were studied through an audit of case records and a second phase confirmation strategy through personal interviews.\nThe mean number of psychoactive drugs prescribed was 2.22 +/- 0.70 (range: 1-6). The rate of polypharmacy was 67 %, with 34.1 % of patients receiving two drugs, 20.5 % receiving three drugs and 12.5 % of the patients receiving four or more psychotropic drugs at the same time. Multiple regression analysis shows that none of the variables considered (age, sex, marital status, educational level, work activity and diagnosis) had predictive value in regards to the number of psychotropic drug used. Benzodiazepines were the most prevalent drugs in single drug therapy, while antidepressants and antipsychotics were the most used in combination with other treatment. A questionably very high degree of same-class polypharmacy was observed, while multiclass, adjunctive and augmentation polypharmacy seems to be more appropriate.\nThe psychiatric clinical practice needs to develop indicators for an appropriate polypharmacy of mental disorders. More research is still needed to identify patients at risk of polypharmacy in order to develop interventions that minimize the risks associated to this treatment alternative."}, {"Title": "Reversal of citalopram-induced junctional bradycardia with intravenous sodium bicarbonate.", "Abstract": "The cardiotoxicity of tricyclic antidepressants is a well-described phenomenon requiring serious consideration in patients who have taken an overdose. In patients who are at high risk for suicide attempts, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were thought to constitute a safe alternative. However, evidence is accumulating that they, too, possess proarrhythmic properties, which must be reconciled in the setting of an overdose. An 82-year-old woman intentionally ingested citalopram 1.6 g. Several hours after presentation, she developed sinus arrest and junctional bradycardia that resolved after infusion of intravenous sodium bicarbonate solution. Thereafter, she demonstrated no further electrocardiographic abnormalities and was safely transferred to the psychiatry service without the need for a temporary transvenous pacemaker. The dramatic effect of the sodium bicarbonate on the arrhythmia represents a probable event according to the Naranjo probability scale. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate may serve as an effective antidote to SSRI-induced bradyarrhythmias."}, {"Title": "EEG microstate duration and syntax in acute, medication-naive, first-episode schizophrenia: a multi-center study.", "Abstract": "In young, first-episode, productive, medication-naive patients with schizophrenia, EEG microstates (building blocks of mentation) tend to be shortened.

Sequence rules (microstate concatenations, syntax) conceivably might also be affected. In 27 patients of the above type and 27 controls, from three centers, multichannel resting EEG was analyzed into microstates using k-means clustering of momentary potential topographies into four microstate classes (A-D). In patients, microstates were shortened in classes B and D (from 80 to 70 ms and from 94 to 82 ms, respectively), occurred more frequently in classes A and C, and covered more time in A and less in B. Topography differed only in class B where LORETA tomography predominantly showed stronger left and anterior activity in patients. Microstate concatenation (syntax) generally were disturbed in patients; specifically, the class sequence A-->C-->D-->A predominated in controls, but was reversed in patients (A-->D-->C-->A). In schizophrenia, information processing in certain classes of mental operations might deviate because of precocious termination. The intermittent occurrence might account for Bleuler's \"double bookkeeping.\" The disturbed microstate syntax opens a novel physiological comparison of mental operations between patients and controls."}, {"Title": "[Perspectives of forensic psychiatry.

The historical perspective will be helpful in creating a solid theoretical framework for the ongoing debate on the objectives and methods of forensic psychiatry as a scientific field and will support arguments against uncritical shortcomings and simplifications, so often met in recent years. Forensic psychiatry can only be understood properly in the context of general psychiatry, including its historical dimension. Significant neurobiological and neurophilosophical approaches to the mind-brain relationship in general and to the etiology of mental disorders in particular are outlined.

We used these data to compare risks and types of hallucinations and associated factors by bivariate and multivariate testing in patients diagnosed with BPD, major depression, or schizophrenia.\nAt admission, the cross-sectional prevalence of current hallucinations among 4972 hospitalized subjects ranked: schizophrenia (61.1%), bipolar mixed (22.9%), bipolar manic (11.2%), bipolar depressed (10.5%), unipolar depressed (5.9%). The most frequent hallucinations across all patients were auditory, followed by somatic and visual hallucinations. There were only minor age or sex differences in risk of hallucinations. Compared with patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, hallucinations among patients with BPD were less severe, more visual and less often auditory. Characteristics of hallucinations were similar among manic and both bipolar- and unipolar-depressed subjects. Among patients with major affective disorders, those with hallucinations were less well-educated, had higher anxiety scores, less insight into the illness, and their hospitalizations averaged 17% longer. Across all diagnoses, hallucinations, particularly olfactory, were significantly associated with delusions. Hallucinations in BPD were most often accompanied by persecutory delusions; delusions of grandeur were least associated with hallucinations.\nThis study provides detailed descriptive data regarding the frequency (cross-sectional) and characteristics of hallucinations in a large sample of patients with BPD, major depression or schizophrenia. Our results suggest a link of lower education and the presence of hallucinations in major affective disorders. The significance of this finding, as well as the role of anxiety in hallucinating patients, requires further study."}, {"Title": "Age at onset in bipolar affective disorders: a review.", "Abstract": "Bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) is a multifactorial disorder with various clinical presentations. Etiologic heterogeneity may partly underlie the phenotypic heterogeneity. Efforts to dissect BPAD have been based on the course of the disorders (BP I versus BP II or rapid cycling), comorbidity pattern (panic attacks, suicide attempts, addiction or hyperactivity), differences between the sexes, and clinical pattern (cycloid and puerperal psychosis). The present article provides a comprehensive review of the existing data, showing that age at onset (AAO) identifies homogeneous sub-groups of patients with BPAD. Recent work has demonstrated the existence of three--early, intermediate and late--onset bipolar sub-groups based on AAO, following Kendell's criteria for validity (The American Journal of Psychiatry 2003; 160: 999). We will also show how these distinctions may be of use in the search for genetic vulnerability factors and other pathogenic influences. Following Kendell's criteria, we show that AAO of bipolar disorders has been tested with most of the available strategies for establishing the validity of clinical syndromes. We also present data from genetic epidemiologic studies in bipolar disorder, showing that AAO sub-groups may reduce the underlying genetic heterogeneity. No accurate AAO thresholds to define valid sub-groups have been identified precisely. Until recently, studies defined early- and late-onset as corresponding to early or mid-adulthood, not taking into account juvenile-onset bipolar disorder. A recently proposed theoretical model with three AAO sub-groups (onset age 17, 27 and 46) is discussed."}, {"Title": "Optimized neuropsychological procedures at different stages of dementia diagnostics.", "Abstract": "To establish a staged procedure in dementia diagnostics and to propose specific, abbreviated test batteries suitable for the three diagnostic stages: Primary medical care, neuro-psychiatry, and memory clinic.\nA total of 159 participants underwent comprehensive clinical, neurological, neuropsychological, and MRI examinations.

The PDC is affiliated with the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences at McMaster University. The program's goals are to provide comprehensive outpatient care and early interventions for persons in the early stages of illness and, consequently, to improve symptom control and functioning and reduce hospitalizations. Key service components include providing low dosages of antipsychotics, offering specialized family education, and supporting return to school and work settings.\nThis study compared outcomes before and after enrolment in the PDC to determine whether first-episode patients achieved improved symptom control and functioning and fewer hospitalizations.\nFor a 12-month period, we followed 40 patients, aged between 16 and 45 years, who experienced their first episode of psychotic illness between 1997 and 2000.

Though omega-3 fatty acids (from fatty fish in the human diet) appear effective in the prevention of stress, their role as regulator of mood and of libido is a matter for discussion pending experimental proof in animal and human models. Dietary omega-3 fatty acids play a role in the prevention of some disorders including depression, as well as in dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Their direct role in major depression, bipolar disorder (manic-depressive disease) and schizophrenia is not yet established. Their deficiency can prevent the renewal of membranes, and thus accelerate cerebral ageing; none the less, the respective roles of the vascular component on one hand (where the omega-3's are active) and the cerebral parenchyma itself on the other, have not yet been clearly resolved. The role of omega-3 in certain diseases such as dyslexia and autism is suggested. In fact, omega-3 fatty acids participated in the first coherent experimental demonstration of the effect of dietary substances (nutrients) on the structure and function of the brain. Experiments were first of all carried out one x-vivo cultured brain cells (1), then on in vivo brain cells(2), finally on physiochemical, biochemical, physiological, neurosensory, and behavioural parameters (3). These findings indicated that the nature of poly unsaturated fatty acids(in particular omega-3) present in formula milks for infants (both premature and term) determines the visual, cerebral,and intellectual abilities, as described in a recent review (4). Indeed,the insufficient dietary supply of omega-3 fatty acids in today's French and occidental diet raises the problem of how to correct dietary habits so that the consumer will select foods that are genuinely rich in omega-3/ the omega-3 family ; mainly rapeseed, (canola) and walnut oils on one hand and fatty fish on the other."}, {"Title": "An economic evaluation of inpatient residential treatment programs in the Department of Veterans Affairs.", "Abstract": "The Veterans Health Administration (VA) established psychosocial residential rehabilitation treatment programs (RTPs) to treat eligible veterans who have psychiatric and substance use disorders in a less intensive and more self-reliant inpatient setting.

Panel regression models using data from 1993 through 1999 indicated that RTPs were associated with 8.6 and 24.4 percent decreases in the average cost per day for inpatient psychiatry and substance use care, respectively. During this time, VA transitioned much of the inpatient mental health care to ambulatory services.

Then there follows a discussion of the currently most popular mind-brain theories in philosophy. In comparison to the more marginal dualist variants (interactionism, epiphenomenalism, parallelism), it is mainly the monistic positions of non-reductive, reductive and eliminative materialism and the materialist functionalism underlying it, which determines analytical philosophy of mind and its influence on psychopathology and psychiatry. Under the additional influence of modern brain research methods, particularly neuroimaging, it is progressively developing into a subdiscipline of neuroscience, a complex and increasingly more firmly established scientific discipline which comprises the totality of all sciences dealing with neuronal functions, including the close epistemic associations of APM and neuroimaging. This is the effective epistemic central idea determining the theory of the neuronal network which, in the form of a connectionist psychopathology, is intended to make possible a fundamentally new access to the comprehension of psychiatric forms of illness. In this respect it is evident, however, that the perception of the naturality of the mind as the fundamental thesis of APM and thus of connectionism cannot be followed through, since, up to now, neither from the phenomenality of the mind (especially the quality of senses, \"Qualia\") nor from intentionality of the mind (i. e. the ability to act intentionally, free from the constraint of the causality of nature and thus in self-responsible fashion) has proved it possible to reconstruct a generally accepted naturalist theory. Furthermore, it has not been possible to reformulate it in an exclusively physical, i. e. non-phenomenological concept and terminology which is, above all, free from the intentionality idiom. The consequence of this, however, is that a connectionist psychopathology can only represent a subpersonal, i. e., subhuman area and that in order to establish a personal psychopathology, naturalistic unreduced theories of experience-qualities and intentional acts of completeness are absolutely essential. The neuroscientific-connectionist paradigm of psychopathology must therefore - at least for the present - be supplement by the paradigm of a non-natural (e. g. phenomenological-hermeneutic) psychopathology. This result can only encourage the relinquishing of epistemically one-sided materialist and other monistic mind-brain theories of APM in favour of an epistemically open pragmatic interactionist dualism as the scientific position which best represents the current state of knowledge."}, {"Title": "[Perceptions of quality of life in schizophrenic patients].", "Abstract": "Subjective quality of life in schizophrenic persons is a commonly applied indicator in outcomes research.

A qualitative content-analysis resulted in a comprehensive hierarchy of categories. The proportion of persons who mentioned a respective QoL-aspect was compared.

They had fewer assertions on work aspects as well as in social domains (family, social relationships, partnership). The proportion of statements in social domains was negatively associated with the degree of chronicity. Among other things the schizophrenic persons showed a higher proportion of statements regarding \"oral needs\" (food, drinking-related statements, smoking) and (problems with) daily activities; both domains were associated with the degree of chronicity.\nDifferences between schizophrenic and mentally healthy persons in their perceptions of QoL were more pronounced with increasing chronicity.

This study evaluates the validity and reliability of 4 15-18-station OSCEs for 128 students over 1 year. Face and content validity were assessed by a panel of clinicians and from feedback from OSCE participants. Correlations with consultant clinical 'firm grades' were performed. Interrater reliability and internal consistency (interstation reliability) were assessed using generalisability theory.\nThe OSCE was feasible to conduct and had a high level of high perceived face and content validity. Consultant firm grades correlated moderately with scores on interactive stations and poorly with written and video stations. Overall reliability was moderate to good, with G-coefficients in the range 0.55-0.68 for the 4 OSCEs.\nIntegrating a range of modalities into an OSCE in psychiatry appears to represent a feasible, generally valid and reliable method of examination on a restricted budget. Different types of stations appear to have different advantages and disadvantages, supporting the integration of both interactive and written components into the OSCE format."}, {"Title": "A case of psychosis with temporal lobe epilepsy: SPECT changes with treatment.", "Abstract": "An 8-year-old male was referred to the child psychiatry department because of vivid visual and auditory hallucinations, including multiple voices talking to each other, and loss of consciousness. Magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed cortical dysgenesis in the left inferior frontal cortex and adjacent subcortical structures. Single-photon emission computed tomography imaging revealed left temporal hypoperfusion. Risperidone therapy was initiated because there was no remission after carbamazepine and sodium valproate treatment. After risperidone treatment, symptoms remitted. A control single-photon emission computed tomography study indicated that the left temporal hypoperfusion was normalized.

Whilst de-institutionalisation has not seen its expected level of success overseas, the provision of community-based psychiatric care has been shown to be more cost-effective than hospital-based inpatient care. As such, there is a need for increased emphasis on community psychiatric services, both to provide and to effectively utilise available resources to assist patients with severe mental illnesses in living and functioning within the community. In line with several other efforts, a pilot Assertive Community Treatment or ACT Programme was launched by IMH in November 2003.

With the services provided by the ACT team including psychosocial rehabilitation, it is hoped that patients will continue to receive adequate psychiatric care as well as maintain sufficient skills for self-care and independent living within the community despite the well-documented deteriorating course of psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Do daughters with eating disorders agree with their parents' perception of family functioning?", "Abstract": "The current study compared the perceptions of family functioning between daughters with eating disorders (EDs) and their parents. This investigation was an expansion of the Fornari et al (Compr Psychiatry 1999;40:434-441) study, which investigated the relationship between the perceived family functioning and depressive symptoms in individuals with ED patients receiving outpatient services.\nOne hundred twenty-six female subjects, ranging in age from 13 to 34 years (mean 18.3 years) completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (Arch Gen Psychiatry 1961;4:561-571) and the Family Assessment Device (FAD) (J Marital Fam Ther 1983;9:171-180) on admission to an outpatient ED program. The patient's parent(s) (118 mothers and 96 fathers) also completed the FAD. Eating disorder subgroup diagnosis and major depressive disorder diagnosis were established according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition , criteria, using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Lifetime (Arch Gen Psychiatry 1987;35:837-844). Repeated measures analysis of covariance was performed comparing family members on each of the 7 subscales of the FAD with BDI entered as the covariate.\nStatistically significant differences were found between patient and parental perceptions of overall family functioning. Mothers rated family functioning as significantly healthier and less chaotic than their daughters did. There were fewer significant differences between maternal and paternal perceptions of family functioning, and no significant differences between fathers' and daughters' perceptions of the family. Eating disorder diagnosis did not contribute to these differences in perception of family functioning. In addition, high self-reported depressive symptoms of the daughters were related to the perception of high family dysfunction for all 3 informants; depressive symptoms did not, however, alter the differences in perception between family members.\nDifferences in viewpoints between parents and daughters regarding the family environment may contribute to the continuation of a dysfunctional family pattern and maintenance of the ED and/or impact negatively on the course of treatment. Possible implications for treatment are discussed, particularly because of the differences of the mothers' views. The results of this study strongly support the importance of including the patient's family in the initial evaluation, regardless of the patient's age."}, {"Title": "Predictors of aggression on the psychiatric inpatient service.", "Abstract": "Patients with severe mental illness are at increased risk to commit acts of aggression in the inpatient hospital setting. Aggressive behaviors have severe negative consequences for the patient, victims, clinical staff, and the therapeutic community as a whole. While risk factors of community and inpatient aggression overlap, many predictive factors diverge between the two settings. For example, while medication noncompliance has been a robust predictor of community aggression, this factor has little predictive value for inpatient settings where patients' pharmacotherapy is closely monitored. Relatively fewer investigators have examined a wide range of predictive factors associated with aggressive acts committed on the psychiatry inpatient service, often with conflicting results. The present study examined demographic, clinical, and neurocognitive performance predictors of self, other, object, and verbal aggressiveness in 118 acute inpatients. Results revealed that the arrival status at the hospital (voluntary vs involuntary), female gender, and substance abuse diagnosis were predictors of verbal aggression and aggression against others. Impaired memory functioning also predicted object aggression. Fewer symptoms, combined with higher cognition functioning, however, were significant predictors of self-aggressive acts committed on the inpatient service. The need for relating predictors of specific types of aggressiveness in schizophrenia is discussed."}, {"Title": "Radiotracer development in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Over the last 20 years a number of radiotracers that target various neurotransmitter systems have been developed for use in imaging studies in psychiatry, but there are many more targets still to be investigated. The development of a radiotracer for clinical positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) neuroimaging studies can be a complex and lengthy process with few imaging agents successfully progressing into clinical human studies. One of the most challenging aspects in the procedure is the development of a rapid and simple radiosynthesis protocol to obtain the potential radiotracer with adequate specific activity, isolated radiochemical yield and radiochemical purity for human imaging. Once a candidate has been radiolabelled, full characterization of the radiotracer is required before it can be used in clinical human studies. Pre-clinical studies include investigation into the binding distribution, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, toxicology and dosimetry of a radiotracer. There are many points during the development procedure where a potential radiotracer can be rejected. Due to interspecies differences the development of a radiotracer can either go too far with an unsuccessful candidate or can potentially lead to rejection of a candidate too soon. It is only when the radiotracer has been used in humans can we be certain that a radiotracer is a useful imaging agent for clinical research studies. The development of new technologies, such as micro-PET or SPECT can only improve our ability to predict the success of a radiotracer."}, {"Title": "Voxel-based morphometry versus region of interest: a comparison of two methods for analyzing gray matter differences in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Many previous studies exploring cortical gray matter (GM) differences in schizophrenia have used \"region of interest\" (ROI) measurements to manually delineate GM volumes. Recently, some investigators have instead employed voxel-based morphometry (VBM), an automated whole-brain magnetic resonance image measurement technique. The purpose of the current study was to compare the above methods in calculating GM distributions in schizophrenia patients relative to matched controls. Using ROIs, Buchanan et al. (Buchanan, R.W., Francis, A., Arango, C., Miller, K., Lefkowitz, D.M., McMahon, R.P., Barta, P.E. and Pearlson, G.D., 2004.

Am J Psychiatry. 161 (2), 322-331.) found decreased dorsolateral prefrontal GM volume and altered symmetry of inferior parietal GM in schizophrenia patients. We hypothesized that VBM analyses of the same data would complement the ROI findings. As predicted, VBM analyses replicated results of less left inferior and right superior frontal cortical GM in schizophrenia. Additionally, VBM uncovered a significantly lower concentration of GM in the middle and superior temporal gyri, sought but not detected using ROIs, but did not replicate the parietal changes. The principal explanation for these differences may be the methodological differences between voxel-averaged, landmark-based ROI analyses and the single, voxel-by-voxel whole brain VBM measurements. Although VBM is rapid and fully automated, it is not a replacement for manual ROI-based analyses. Both methods provide different types of information and should thus be used in tandem."}, {"Title": "Releasing the therapeutic potential of the psychiatric nurse: a human relations perspective of the nurse-patient relationship.", "Abstract": "In psychiatry mental health nurses form the largest professional discipline providing care on an everyday basis for sustained periods. Mental health nurses therefore are in a pivotal position to establish valued therapeutic alliances. In practice, however, a disproportionate amount of nursing time is taken up by administration, time spent talking to patients is minimal and when interactions do occur they remain notionally therapeutic and often are not theoretically informed. This noted paucity of therapeutic contact is antithetical to the aspirations of service users who increasingly are asking for a more skilled approach to the talking-listening that occurs in the therapeutic encounter. It is hypothesized by the present authors that an object-relations perspective of the nurse-patient relationship could release the largely untapped therapeutic potential of the psychiatric nurse by (1) bridging the gap between theory and practice and (2) providing a professional identity from within which nurses can begin to 'get to know' and understand the predicament of the patient with severe mental illness."}, {"Title": "[Eugen Rehfish--pioneer of modern urodynamics].", "Abstract": "Eugen Rehfisch published two important articles on vesical sphincter function and innervation of the bladder in the Archives of Pathologic Anatomy, Physiology and Clinical Medicine edited by R.

Eugen Rehfisch was born in Kempen/Posen on March 6 1862. He studied at the Friedrich Wilhelms University in Berlin and at the Bavarian Julius Maximilian University in Wurzburg. From approximately 1889, he worked as a physician in Berlin and was a co-worker of Leopold Casper (1859-1959) for some time. He performed his important urodynamic studies at the Institute of Physiology of the Friedrich Wilhelms University between 1896 and 1900. After this, he turned to cardiology. Besides articles on urology, he published papers on psychiatry and cardiology. He was an active member of medical societies in Berlin and was awarded the title of a professor.

The objective of this review is to answer questions many neurologists have about disorders characterised by unexplained symptoms (functional disorders) by conducting a multidisciplinary review based on published reports and clinical experience. Current concepts explain functional symptoms as resulting from auto-suggestion, innate coping styles, disorders of volition or attention. Predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating aetiological factors can be identified and contribute to a therapeutic formulation. The sympathetic communication of the diagnosis by the neurologist is important and all patients should be screened for psychiatric or psychological symptoms because up to two thirds have symptomatic psychiatric comorbidity. Treatment programmes are likely to be most successful if there is close collaboration between neurologists, (liaison) psychiatrists, psychologists, and general practitioners. Long term, symptoms persist in over 50% of patients and many patients remain dependent on financial help from the government. Neurologists can acquire the skills needed to engage patients in psychological treatment but would benefit from closer working relationships with liaison psychiatry or psychology."}, {"Title": "An overview of the assessment tools available to mental health professionals to help determine patients at risk of suicide.", "Abstract": "Tools are frequently used in psychiatry in an attempt to assess the patient's mental state and this in turn should partly determine his management. A given example is suicide evaluation, where tools are regularly used but seldom questioned as to their effectiveness or appropriateness. At the outset, this paper highlights the relative paucity of research into suicide assessment scales and rationales are offered explaining this. Furthermore, attention is drawn to the concept that relatively low base rates of suicide can provide false and misleading data. Additionally, analyses are made of a number of suicide assessment scales and this is achieved through a comprehensive literature review on the subject area. The five pieces of research examined come from different parts of the world, however they all share a commonality in that they are Western in culture. Nevertheless, no obvious leader arises from the combined results, with all the scales offering different conclusions as to the most effective scale for evaluating those at risk of suicide. These contradictions may be due to the fact that the research design and methodology used in the studies has been ill thought out and omissions such as the use of qualitative data is discernible in studies that deal with human behaviour. The suggested recommendations provided include further research in this area and that it should include the use of qualitative methods. A further recommendation is that suicide assessment should encompass both the physical environment as well as the patient's mental health and this would help ensure a more encompassing and in-depth assessment of the patient. Nevertheless, assessment scales, no matter how thorough they appear, should not be seen as a panacea for determining the overall management of a patient."}, {"Title": "[Validation of the German version of the Australian Scale of Asperger's Syndrome (ASAS)].", "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to validate the German version of the Australian Scale for Asperger's Syndrome (ASAS).

The diagnoses of the M-CIDI and the psychiatric-psychosomatic examination often did not match. MCS was ruled out in seven patients.\nAccording to the criteria defined by Cullen (5), emotional disturbances must be ruled out before MCS is diagnosed.

In this study, the effects of lithium within one day after its administration (5 mmol/kg BW) on the relative expression of thyroid hormone receptor isoforms and on the cytoplasmic and synaptosomal thyroid hormone availability in adult rat cerebral hemispheres were examined. Although short-term LiCl-treatment did not affect the levels of triiodothyronine either in the synaptosomal or in the cytoplasmic fraction 24 h after LiCl administration, the cytoplasmic availability of thyroxin was lower. In addition, 24 h after the administration of lithium the mRNA levels of the TRalpha1 isoform (T3 binding) increased while the relative expression of the TRalpha2 variant (non-T3 binding) was decreased. Notably, the decrease of the TRalpha2 mRNA levels was also observed 4h after LiCl administration. The expression levels of the TRbeta1 isoform were unaffected in any interval examined.

Administration of elaborate measures of temperament are cumbersome in routine practice. Accordingly, the aim of the present analyses was to test if a practical measure of mood lability was unique to BPII, in comparison with major depressive disorder (MDD).\nUsing the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, Clinician Version as modified by us [J. Affect. Disord. 73 (2003) 33; Curr. Opin. Psychiatry 16 (2003) S71], we interviewed 62 consecutive BPII outpatients, as well as their 59 MDD counterparts during a major depressive episode (MDE). Hypomanic symptoms during MDE were systematically assessed: three or more such symptoms defined depressive mixed state (DMX3) on the basis of previous work by us [J. Affect. Disord. 73 (2003) 113]. A downscaled definition of trait mood lability was adapted from Akiskal et al. [Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 52 (1995) 114] and Angst et al. [J. Affect. Disord. 73 (2003) 133], requiring a positive response to one of two queries on whether one is a person with frequent \"ups and downs\" in mood, and whether such mood swings occur for no reason. The patients selected for inclusion had not received neuroleptics and antidepressants for at least 2 weeks prior to the index episode, they were free of substance and alcohol abuse, and did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD). Associations between mood swings and clinical variables were tested by logistic regression (STATA 7).\nMood swings were endorsed by 50.4% of the entire sample: 62.9% of BPII and 37.2% of MDD (p = 0.0047). This practical measure of mood lability was significantly associated with BPII, lower age at onset, high depressive recurrences, atypical features, and DMX3. When controlled for number of major affective episodes, mood swings were still significantly associated with BP-II. Sensitivity and specificity of mood swings for predicting BPII were 62.9% and 62.7%, respectively.\nThe low specificity of trait mood lability for BPII diagnosis is probably due to the fact that we used a downscaled simplified measure of this trait.\nOn the other hand, the relatively high sensitivity of our downscaled measure of mood lability for predicting BPII supports its usefulness as a screening tool for this diagnosis. The lack of association between self-reported mood lability and number of major mood episodes indicates that such lability does not reflect the perception of history of frequent episodes, and that it has some validity as a trait indicator. Given that our sample excluded patients meeting the DSM-IV criteria for BPD, contradicts the opinion of the latter manual that such mood lability represents its pathognomonic characteristic that distinguishes it from BPII. The bipolar nature of mood lability is further supported by significant associations with external validating criteria for bipolarity. Overall, these data indicate that in the differential diagnosis between MDD and BPII, trait mood lability favors the latter at a significant statistical level."}, {"Title": "The high prevalence of bipolar spectrum disorders in young adults with recurrent depression: toward an innovative diagnostic framework.", "Abstract": "Young adults with early-onset major depressive disorder (MDD) may be at high risk of progression to bipolar disorder. Although hypomanic symptoms are common in young people with depression, many do not reach the strict DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria for hypomania. We used an emerging innovative framework for bipolar spectrum to evaluate this question.\nConsecutive referrals to a psychiatric outpatient clinic at a university health service were assessed for recurrent episodes of depression. DSM-IV diagnoses were based on a SCID-1 interview. We used two approaches to delineate bipolar spectrum. The first focused on bipolar spectrum disorder (BSD, as defined by Ghaemi et al. [Can. J. Psychiatry 47 (2002) 125]), and the second on a symptoms perspective based on MDD with a history of hypomanic symptoms, using a 15-point hypomanic symptoms checklist with a cut-off > or =8 or more symptoms (modified from J. Affect. Disord. 73 (2003) 39 and J. Affect. Disord. 73 (2003) 73). Data were also obtained on family history of affective disorder, course and number of episodes of depression, symptom severity, psychosocial functioning, suicidality and deliberate self-harm, and drug and alcohol use.\nHigh rates of bipolar and bipolar spectrum disorder were identified. Under DSM-IV, 14 subjects (16.1%) had bipolar affective disorder and 73 subjects (83.9%) had recurrent MDD. Depending on the method used to diagnose bipolar spectrum, between 47.1% and 77.0% of the total cohort could be so diagnosed. Hypomanic symptom counts, irrespective of duration, yielded the highest estimates for bipolar spectrum. High rates of pharmacological hypomania were also identified: 12 subjects (16.4%) with recurrent MDD group reported this, and all could be diagnosed with bipolar spectrum.\nThe reliability of using the 15-point hypomanic scale for the diagnostic assignments was not tested. All subjects were recruited from a university health service and, given the affluence of their parents, findings may not generalise to other populations. Most importantly, because bipolar family history and pharmacological hypomania were part of the diagnostic criteria of the BSD group, they could not be used as external validators for Ghaemi's BSD construct.\nBipolar disorders emerge as extremely common in this cohort of young adults with recurrent depression. Antidepressant-induced hypomania and high scores on a hypomanic symptoms checklist help to identify patients who are likely to have a bipolar spectrum illness, but who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder. This is a preliminary study, and further evidence from external validating strategies are needed to verify the bipolar status of these patients in a larger and unselected cohort representing a broader socio-economic demographic profile."}, {"Title": "Profiles of \"manic\" symptoms in bipolar I, bipolar II and major depressive disorders.", "Abstract": "Classical authors such as Kraepelin, as well as the emerging literature during the past decade, indicate that manic-like signs and symptoms are present to a variable degree in all mood disorders. Current nosography does not differentiate between them and only the number of symptoms or severity is used for classification. This is particularly true for mania and hypomania. This paper will analyze the patterns of manic symptoms in bipolar I (BP-I), bipolar II (BP-II) and major depressive disorders (MDD), to test the hypothesis that mania and hypomania have different profiles, and ascertain which excitatory manic phenomena do occur in unipolar MDD.\nSix hundred and fifty-two inpatients (158 BP-I, 122 BP-II and 372 MDD) were assessed using the operational criteria for psychotic illness checklist (OPCRIT) [Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 48 (1991) 764] with a lifetime perspective. Manic or hypomanic symptoms were investigated and compared between BP-I, BP-II and MDD.\nWhen compared with BP-II, BP-I disorder had a higher prevalence of reckless activity, distractibility, psychomotor agitation, irritable mood and increased self-esteem. These five symptoms correctly classified 82.8% of BP-I and 80.1% of BP-II patients. One or two manic symptoms were observed in more than 30% of major depressive patients; psychomotor agitation was the most frequent manifestations present in 18% of the MDD group.\nWe did not control for severity of symptoms, nor for neuroleptic use that could produce akathisia.\nThis study suggests that mania and hypomania can be differentiated in their symptom profiles, and highlights the presence of few manic symptoms, particularly psychomotor agitation, in MDD. From the standpoint of number of manic signs and symptoms, controlling for psychomotor agitation did not substantially change the predictive power of the remaining manic symptoms. Given that excitatory manic signs and symptoms are present to a decreasing degree in BP-I, BP-II and MDD, these disorders can be proposed to lie along a dimensional model. Overall, these data are compatible with the concept of a bipolar spectrum, whereby each of the affective subtypes requires specific genetic factors."}, {"Title": "Hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal system regulation and suicidal behavior in depression.", "Abstract": "One of the most demanding tasks in psychiatry is to protect patients from suicidal attempts.

So far data on the involvement of the HPA axis in the pathophysiology of suicidal behavior in depressed patients are controversial.\nIn this retrospective study, we administered the combined dexamethasone-suppression/CRH stimulation (Dex/CRH) test to 310 patients with a depressive syndrome characterized at admission for acute and past suicidal behavior within the first 10 days after hospitalization.\nSuicidal behavior in depressed patients, including past and recent suicide attempts as well as suicidal ideation, was associated with a lower adrenocorticotropin and cortisol response in the combined Dex/CRH test, with lowest hormone levels observed in patients with a recent suicide attempt.\nThe findings suggest that suicidal behavior may alter HPA axis regulation in depressed patients. Large-scale prospective studies assessing neuroendocrine changes may help to develop predictors for an early identification of patients at risk for committing suicide."}, {"Title": "[A crucial moment of psychopathology: Heidegger's review of Jaspers' Psychology of the conceptions of the world].", "Abstract": "From the current status of psychopathology abolition, in behalf of a reductionist and non-satisfactory empiricism that has overwhelmed psychiatry in a sterile paralysis, we question its origin, discovering in Jaspers the methodological problems that made him unable to assume obstacles and led us to the present situation. Matching Heidegger's review on Psychology of the conceptions of the world, we are tracing the criticism to that methodology, in an attempt to approach the model of a new empiricism for psychopathology that solves the current situation. We use this occasion to pursue the tracks followed by one of the confronted attitudes or another that we consider a psychopathology crossroad. We are investigating the consequences and alternatives derived for that new task in present time, once these methodological positions have been assumed."}, {"Title": "[Drug use in pregnancy].", "Abstract": "Drug use in pregnancy is associated with a number of serious complications for mother and fetus. There are safe data on destructive effects of alcohol, cocain, marijuana and tobacco on pregnancy and neonatal outcome. Of importance is the fact that for many drugs similar effects on pregnancy could be observed: vasoconstriction of the placental vessels resulting in placental abruption, preterm labour (mother), spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth retardation, low birth weight, preterm delivery and stillbirth (fetus). Symptoms of withdrawal and neurodevelopmental disorders are the most important problems of the neonate. However, only small data exist about the effects of recently popular party drugs like ecstasy or LSD. In addition, from most drugs, with exception of alcohol, safe information about the risk of congenital malformations doesn't exist. Nevertheless they may be a useful guide in the diagnostic of potential malformations by ultrasound. Most of pregnant women using drugs are poly-drug users and are often in reduced general condition. They need therefore the intensive care of the obstetrician in cooperation with other specialists (internal medicine, psychiatry)."}, {"Title": "[Antidepressants and pregnancy].", "Abstract": "Depressive disorders in women are not uncommon during the reproductive period. Identifying women at risk for the development of depression, early detection of depressive symptoms and an adequate treatment are important issues in preventing severe chronic depressive disorders. Do psychotherapeutic interventions not show any sufficient benefits, the use of antidepressants is indicated. In the meantime sufficient data are available concerning the use of anti-depressants during pregnancy to exclude any serious damage to the fetus or newborn. As a basic principle, a monotherapy should be favoured and the drug applicated in the lowest efficient dose. Due to the SSRI's side effect profile the choice of the antidepressant should be done in favour of serotonin reuptake inhibitors rather than tri- and tetracyclic antidepressants. For both substance groups there is no hint for any teratogenic potential. Benzodiazepine should be prescribed with caution. Negative long term effects to the newborn cannot be excluded. Based on few available data, indeed, there exists no reservation against the use of St. John's wort during pregnancy and breastfeeding. A profound ultrasound screening of the organs should be performed in case of lithium exposition, whereas newer studies showed no increase in risk for Ebstein anomaly. A multidisciplinary approach, including psychiatry, obstetrics and neonatology should be always aimed at in case of depressive disorders during pregnancy."}, {"Title": "[Status, possibilities and limitations of therapies in psychosomatic day clinics].", "Abstract": "During the past few years, several psychosomatic day clinics have been established. The goal of this paper was to research the programs these day hospitals offer, their general set-up, as well as their indication criteria. We surveyed 18 day clinics, which we had identified via internet. Most of the day clinics have the capability to treat between ten and twenty patients and work mainly with group concepts. Mean treatment duration ranges from 7 to 12 weeks. Although having patients with different diagnoses, most day clinics treat them together, while some day clinics concentrate on special diagnoses (eating disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders). Overall, the day clinics' main diagnoses, therapeutic programs, and treatment durations are comparable with those of in-patient hospitals in Germany. It appears that day clinic treatment is especially appropriate for patients who have difficulties in incorporating their experiences from an (in-house) therapy into the real world, as well as patients who have to care for family members (e. g. children) while in treatment. An enquiry to the federal states of Germany showed that, in the area of psychotherapeutic medicine, there are 324 day clinic places as well as 2,639 beds for acute inpatient treatment available. Six federal states, however, do not allocate beds for psychotherapeutic medicine in particular, but assign them to the area of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The changing relationship between mental health nurses and psychiatrists in the United Kingdom.", "Abstract": "This paper illustrates key developments in the changing relationship between the two professions over the last 200 years.\nTo understand the current relationship between mental health nurses and psychiatrists within the UK, it is necessary to understand the historical development of that relationship.\nInformation was sought from a range of primary documentary sources, including contemporary journals, asylum documents and official governmental and health service reports. Secondary sources, such as histories of medicine, nursing and individual asylums provided further supportive information.\nPsychiatry emerged as a profession at the end of the 18th century and found a power base within county asylums from the middle of the 19th century. Medical superintendents, the doctors in charge of asylums, had strict control over the activities of attendants, the justification for which was the need to protect patients from cruelty and neglect. Superintendents' desire for their own enhanced professional status led to formalized training for attendants at the end of the 19th Century, in which training materials again reinforced the importance of obedience by nurses (as attendants had become known). During the 1920s, trade unions struggled for improved pay and conditions, whilst professionalizing mental health nursing was a secondary priority. Reorganization following creation of the National Health Service in 1948 lessened superintendents' authority, and ultimately the management of mental health nursing shifted from them. The move towards community care allowed mental health nurses to develop greater independence, which was supported by changes in nurse education.\nPsychiatrists in the UK remain highly influential, despite the move from their traditional power base in hospitals. Changes in mental health care, such as new nurse prescribing powers and the loss of psychiatrists' control over admission of patients to hospital, will continue to change the relationship between mental health nursing and psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Serotonergic and dopaminergic systems in anorexia nervosa: a role for atypical antipsychotics?", "Abstract": "To review serotonergic and dopaminergic system function in anorexia nervosa in terms of potential modulation by atypical antipsychotic medications.\nA systematic review of clinical, neurobiological and functional neuroimaging findings of serotonergic and dopaminergic system activity in anorexia nervosa was conducted via MEDLINE, PsycINFO and EMBASE psychiatry databases, with a critical review of dysregulation of these systems as therapeutic targets for atypical antipsychotics, in context of evidence regarding the utility and efficacy of these medications in this syndrome.\nThere is evidence of persistently altered serotonergic and dopaminergic function in anorexia nervosa independent to weight-recovery.

Clinical symptoms were evaluated using the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS) before and after 8 weeks of treatment with 300-600 mg/day of chlorpromazine. Our results show that genotyping -141C Ins/Del may help to predict the efficacy of chlorpromazine treatment (P=0.01) due to the fact that patients with no Del allele showed greater improvement than those with Del allele on the overall BPRS (P=0.03), and that, therefore, the potential for therapy in patients with schizophrenia is related to the -141C Ins/Del polymorphism in the DRD2 gene.

Brain lipids, formed of fatty acids, participate in the structure of membranes, for instance 50 % fatty acids are polyunsaturated in the gray matter, 1/3 are of the omega-3 family, and are thus of dietary origin. The omega-3 fatty acids (mainly alpha-linolenic acid, ALA) participated in one of the first experimental demonstration of the effect of dietary substances (nutrients) on the structure and function of the brain. Experiments were first of all carried out on ex vivo cultured brain cells, then on in vivo brain cells (neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) from animals fed ALA deficient diet, finally on physicochemical (membrane fluidity), biochemical, physiological, neurosensory (vision an auditory responses), and behavioural or learning parameters. These findings indicated that the nature of polyunsaturated fatty acids (in particular omega-3) present in formula milks for human infants determines to a certain extend the visual, neurological, and intellectual abilities. Thus, in view of these results and of the high polyunsaturated fatty acid content of the brain, it is normal to consider that they could be involved in psychiatric diseases and in the cognitive decline of ageing. Omega-3 fatty acids appear effective in the prevention of stress, however their role as regulator of mood is a matter for discussion. Indeed, they play a role in the prevention of some disorders including depression (especially post partum), as well as in dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Their role in major depression and bipolar disorder (manic-depressive disease), only poorly documented, is not clearly demonstrated. The intervention of omega-3 in dyslexia, autism, and schizophrenia has been suggested, but it does not necessarily infer a nutritional problems. The respective importance of the vascular system (where the omega-3 are actually active) and the cerebral parenchyma itself, remain to be resolved. However, the insufficient supply of omega-3 fatty acids in today diet in occidental (less than 50 % of the recommended dietary intakes values for ALA) raises the problem of how to correct inadequate dietary habits, by prescribing mainly rapeseed (canola) and walnut oils on the one hand, fatty fish (wild, or farmed, but the nature of fatty acids present in fish flesh is the direct consequence of the nature of fats with which they have been fed), and eggs from laying hens fed omega-3 fatty acids."}, {"Title": "Utility of a depression score to predict candidacy for hepatitis C virus therapy in veterans: a prospective longitudinal study.", "Abstract": "The frequency and determinants of receipt of antiviral therapy once a diagnosis of a mood disorder is established in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients remains unknown.\nTo examine the incidence and determinants of receiving antiviral therapy in HCV-infected veterans with abnormal scores of Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS).\nWe systematically evaluated the presence of psychiatric disorders among HCV-infected patients with initial referral between September 2000 and May 2002.

[2000: Mol Psychiatry 5:633-637; Lakatos et al. [2002: Mol Psychiatry 7:27-31]) by analyses based on parental genetic data confirmed the link between infant attachment and the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) gene. Extended transmission disequilibrium tests (ETDT) were performed to determine whether biased transmission of exon III 48 basepair repeat alleles occurred to infants displaying disorganized and secure attachment behavior with their mothers. The overall allele-wise TDTs were significant for both groups (P = 0.038 and 0.020, respectively): a trend for preferential transmission of the seven-repeat allele to disorganized infants was observed (TDT(chi)(2) = 3.27, df = 1, P = 0.071), and there was a significant non-transmission of the same allele to securely attached infants (TDT(chi)(2) = 6.00, df = 1, P = 0.014). Analysis of haplotypes of the exon III repeat and the -521 C/T promoter polymorphisms in family trios showed that the transmission bias in the larger secure group was due to the low-rate transmission of the T.7 haplotype containing both the seven-repeat and the -521 T alleles (TDT(chi)(2) = 4.46, df = 1, P = 0.035). This suggests that not carrying the T.7 haplotype of the DRD4 gene may act as a resilience factor in the optimal development of early attachment."}, {"Title": "[Psychogenic Disorders in German soldiers during World War I and II].", "Abstract": "In the First and Second World War German soldiers frequently suffered from psychogenic disorders. By comparison a change in the prevalences can be noted: in the First World War dissociative disorders dominated the clinical impression (\"shell shock\"), in the Second World War they could rarely be seen but were replaced by somatoform and psychosomatic diseases. The discussion about numerous reasons for this development has not been completed yet and is still not free from political attitudes. To achieve a more scientific point of view, the perspective of psychotraumatology might be helpful. According to psychotraumatic research, dissociative and somatoform disorders can emerge in a close relation to a Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. The choice of symptoms depends on personality traits of the victim, but also on specific factors that characterise the situation in which the trauma appears. The mixture of pathogenetic and protective influences includes e. g. the possibility of flight- or fight reactions, feelings of trauma-associated guilt and group cohesion in the military unit. These factors can be useful to help explain the change of symptoms between both wars. In addition the analysis of situational conditions in former wars can give hints to actual planning and prophylaxis strategies in modern military psychiatry, that has to adjust to very different military operation fields."}, {"Title": "The relevance of medical sociology to psychiatry: a historical view.", "Abstract": "Collaboration between sociology and psychiatry is traced to the 1920s when, stimulated by Harry Stack Sullivan and Adolph Meyer, the relationship was activated by common theoretical and research interests. Immediately after World War II, this became a true partnership, stimulated by the National Institute of Mental Health, the Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry, and the growing influence of psychoanalytic theory. The effects of a sociology that focused on issues of health and illness proceeded to grow in medical education, research, and the treatment of mental illness until 1980, when a distinct shift of emphasis in psychiatry occurred. In its role as educator of future physicians, postwar psychiatry developed a paradigm of biopsychosocial behavior but, after 3 decades, changed to a biopharmacological model. The definition of mental illness as a deviant extreme in developmental and interpersonal characteristics lost favor to nosological diagnoses of discrete or dichotomous models. Under a variety of intellectual, socioeconomic, and political pressures, psychiatry reduced its interest in and relationship with sociology, replacing it in part with bioethics and economics.

Over 60% of private psychiatrists identified problems with access to the public system as a barrier to successful shared care arrangements. It also emerged, as hypothesized, that the public and private systems tend to manage different patient populations and that public clinicians in particular are not fully aware of the private psychiatrists' range of expertise. This would result in fewer referrals for shared care across the sectors.\nA number of barriers to public sector clinicians and private psychiatrists collaborating in shared care arrangements were identified. The two groups surveyed identified similar barriers. Some of these can potentially be addressed by changes to service systems. Others require cultural shifts in both sectors. Improved communications including more opportunities for formal and informal meetings between people working in the two sectors would be likely to improve the understanding of the complementary sector's perspective and practice. Further changes would be expected to require careful work between the sectors on training, employment and practice protocols and initiatives, to allow better use of the existing services and resources."}, {"Title": "Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders.", "Abstract": "The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists is co-ordinating the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in psychiatry, funded under the National Mental Health Strategy (Australia) and the New Zealand Health Funding Authority. This paper presents CPGs for schizophrenia and related disorders. Over the past decade schizophrenia has become more treatable than ever before. A new generation of drug therapies, a renaissance of psychological and psychosocial interventions and a first generation of reform within the specialist mental health system have combined to create an evidence-based climate of realistic optimism. Progressive neuroscientific advances hold out the strong possibility of more definitive biological treatments in the near future. However, this improved potential for better outcomes and quality of life for people with schizophrenia has not been translated into reality in Australia. The efficacy-effectiveness gap is wider for schizophrenia than any other serious medical disorder. Therapeutic nihilism, under-resourcing of services and a stalling of the service reform process, poor morale within specialist mental health services, a lack of broad-based recovery and life support programs, and a climate of tenacious stigma and consequent lack of concern for people with schizophrenia are the contributory causes for this failure to effectively treat. These guidelines therefore tackle only one element in the endeavour to reduce the impact of schizophrenia. They distil the current evidence-base and make recommendations based on the best available knowledge.\nA comprehensive literature review (1990-2003) was conducted, including all Cochrane schizophrenia reviews and all relevant meta-analyses, and a number of recent international clinical practice guidelines were consulted. A series of drafts were refined by the expert committee and enhanced through a bi-national consultation process.\nThis guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of schizophrenia by treatment type and by phase of illness. The essential features of the guidelines are: (i) Early detection and comprehensive treatment of first episode cases is a priority since the psychosocial and possibly the biological impact of illness can be minimized and outcome improved. An optimistic attitude on the part of health professionals is an essential ingredient from the outset and across all phases of illness. (ii) Comprehensive and sustained intervention should be assured during the initial 3-5 years following diagnosis since course of illness is strongly influenced by what occurs in this 'critical period'. Patients should not have to 'prove chronicity' before they gain consistent access and tenure to specialist mental health services. (iii) Antipsychotic medication is the cornerstone of treatment. These medicines have improved in quality and tolerability, yet should be used cautiously and in a more targeted manner than in the past. The treatment of choice for most patients is now the novel antipsychotic medications because of their superior tolerability and, in particular, the reduced risk of tardive dyskinesia. This is particularly so for the first episode patient where, due to superior tolerability, novel agents are the first, second and third line choice. These novel agents are nevertheless associated with potentially serious medium to long-term side-effects of their own for which patients must be carefully monitored. Conventional antipsychotic medications in low dosage may still have a role in a small proportion of patients, where there has been full remission and good tolerability; however, the indications are shrinking progressively. These principles are now accepted in most developed countries. (vi) Clozapine should be used early in the course, as soon as treatment resistance to at least two antipsychotics has been demonstrated. This usually means incomplete remission of positive symptomatology, but clozapine may also be considered where there are pervasive negative symptoms or significant or persistent suicidal risk is present. (v) Comprehensive psychosocial interventions should be routinely available to all patients and their families, and provided by appropriately trained mental health professionals with time to devote to the task. This includes family interventions, cognitive-behaviour therapy, vocational rehabilitation and other forms of therapy, especially for comorbid conditions, such as substance abuse, depression and anxiety. (vi) The social and cultural environment of people with schizophrenia is an essential arena for intervention. Adequate shelter, financial security, access to meaningful social roles and availability of social support are essential components of recovery and quality of life. (vii) Interventions should be carefully tailored to phase and stage of illness, and to gender and cultural background. (viii) Genuine involvement of consumers and relatives in service development and provision should be standard. (ix) Maintenance of good physical health and prevention and early treatment of serious medical illness has been seriously neglected in the management of schizophrenia, and results in premature death and widespread morbidity. Quality of medical care for people with schizophrenia should be equivalent to the general community standard. (x) General practitioners (GPs)s should always be closely involved in the care of people with schizophrenia. However, this should be truly shared care, and sole care by a GP with minimal or no specialist involvement, while very common, is not regarded as an acceptable standard of care. Optimal treatment of schizophrenia requires a multidisciplinary team approach with a consultant psychiatrist centrally involved."}, {"Title": "Respite care for caregivers and people with severe mental illness: literature review.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to review research literature over the past 10 years on respite care for people affected by severe mental illness; and identify key implications for nursing practice in provision of respite care for family caregivers of people with severe mental illness.\nFamily caregivers play an important role in health care, but need regular breaks to maintain their own health and well-being. Respite care is one of the few services available with a primary focus on supporting family caregivers. In most developed countries the notion of respite care as an extension of the health care service has been embraced, evidenced by a growing body of literature in health and health-related disciplines.\nAn initial literature search was undertaken using the key words \"respite\", \"short-term care\", \"shared care\" and \"day care\" in major electronic databases for nursing, psychiatry, psychology and sociology literature between 1967 and 2002, identifying 704 articles. Closer examination of the literature from 1993 to 2002 on gaps and trends in respite care for people affected by severe mental illness was conducted. This is discussed in the context of the broader literature, particularly on dementia, where the mainstream research on respite care is found.\nThe majority of family caregiving studies identified a need for greater quality, quantity, variety and flexibility in respite provision, and the literature has remained largely silent in relation to those affected by severe mental illness. There are contradictory findings on outcomes of respite care services and a lack of controlled empirical studies and evaluative research on effectiveness.\nRespite care is beneficial for caregivers, there is significant unmet need in provision of services for the mentally ill, and greater flexibility and the needs of caregivers should be recognised and addressed."}, {"Title": "The production of the psychiatric subject: power, knowledge and Michel Foucault.", "Abstract": "The issue of power has become increasingly important within psychiatry, psychotherapy and mental health nursing generally. This paper will suggest that the work of Michel Foucault, the French philosopher and historian, has much to contribute to the discussion about the nature, existence and exercise of power within contemporary mental health care. As well as examining his original and challenging account of power, Foucault's emphasis on the intimate relationship between power and knowledge will be explored within the context of psychiatry and mental health nursing. This is to say that the paper will investigate Foucault's account of how power and knowledge are central to the process by which human beings are 'made subjects' and therefore how 'psychiatric identities' are produced. In doing so, it will be suggested that Foucault's work can not only make a valuable contribution to contemporary discussions about power and knowledge, but can also provide a significant critique and reconceptualization of the theoretical foundations and associated diagnostic and therapeutic practices of psychiatry and mental health nursing."}, {"Title": "Pharmacoepidemiologic study of potential drug interactions in outpatients of a university hospital in Thailand.", "Abstract": "Drug-drug interaction is a potential cause of adverse drug reactions. The incidence of such drug interactions in university hospitals in Thailand is unknown.\nTo estimate the rate of potential drug-drug interactions in outpatients of a typical Thai university hospital, and to identify risk factors for such interactions in Thai patients.\nOne-year outpatients' prescription data were retrieved from the hospital computer records. Potential drug interactions were identified using the existing drug-interaction database system. Potential interactions within a specific prescription and involving drugs prescribed 1-, 3- and 7-day earlier were searched for. Possible associations between occurrence of an interaction and a patient's age and gender and the number of items on the prescription were explored.\nThe overall rate of potential drug interactions was 27.9% with a maximal value of 57.8% at the Department of Psychiatry. The rate of the most potentially significant interactions was 2.6%, being the highest in the Department of Medicine (6.0%), with isoniazid vs. rifampin as the most common interacting combination. The rate increased with the patient's age and prescription size (P=0.000). The odd's ratio of having at least one potential drug interaction was 1.8 (64.2%) when age increased by 20 years (P=0.000) and 2.8 (165.7%) when another drug was added (P=0.000). The rate of potential drug interactions was the same for both genders.

One hypothesis is that these disorders are secondary to a malfunction of neurotrophic factors. Inappropriate neurotrophic support during brain development could lead to structural disorganisation in which neuronal networks are established in a nonoptimal manner. Inadequate neurotrophic support in adult individuals could ultimately be an underlying mechanism leading to decreased capacity of brain to adaptive changes and increased vulnerability to neurotoxic damage. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a mediator involved in neuronal survival and plasticity of dopaminergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). In this review, we summarize findings regarding altered BDNF in schizophrenia and depression and animal models, as well as the effects of antipsychotic and antidepressive treatments on the expression of BDNF."}, {"Title": "Case-control association study of the close homologue of L1 (CHL1) gene and schizophrenia in the Chinese population.", "Abstract": "The close homolog of L1 (CHL1), located on human chromosome 3p26.1, is a newly identified member of the L1 family of cell adhesion molecules which play important roles in cell migration, axonal growth, and synaptic remodeling.

In behavioral ecology, the term alternative strategies refers to the presence of two or more discrete behavioral variants among adults of one sex and one population when those variants serve the same functional end. Often discrete behavioral variants are associated with specific morphological, physiological, and life-history characters. The concept of alternative strategies has been applied to human behavior to explain the origin of some behavioral syndromes that are currently classified as mental disorders or emotional dysfunctions. Antisocial personality could represent a high-risk strategy of social defection associated with resource acquisition and reproduction. Insecure attachment could represent an evolved psychological mechanism that used the quality of parental care received during childhood as a cue for optimizing adult reproductive strategies. Since a major contribution of evolutionary theory is the insight that individual differences are core biological features of any animal species, including Homo sapiens, the application of the concept of alternative strategies to psychiatry and clinical psychology can be a powerful antidote to the growing tendency to medicalize human diversity."}, {"Title": "Suicidal behavior: relationship between phenotype and serotonergic genotype.", "Abstract": "The basis of suicidal behavior (SB) is complex and multifactorial. Numerous risk factors have been identified. Epidemiological genetics studies (family studies, twin studies, adoption studies) suggest that there is a genetic basis to SB and that this genetic basis is specific and independent from the genetic factors implicated in predisposition to psychiatric disorders associated with SB (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, alcoholism). Recently, new molecular genetics tools have been designed to identify the genetic factors that predispose certain individuals to disorders of complex etiology. Biological psychiatry studies have suggested that the physiopathology of SB involves dysfunctioning of the serotonin system. The first genetic association studies tested candidate genes encoding proteins involved in serotonin metabolism. The results of these studies suggest that the gene coding for the limiting enzyme in the synthesis of serotonin, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), and the gene encoding the serotonin transporter are involved in predisposition to SB. Furthermore, it is likely that these genes interact with each other and with environmental factors (early) and that they have different phenotypic consequences. One of the main aims of studies currently underway is to identify the precise phenotypes associated with genes that predispose to SB or intermediate phenotypes (impulsivity, inability to control anger, etc.)."}, {"Title": "Computer-aided DSM-IV-diagnostics - acceptance, use and perceived usefulness in relation to users' learning styles.", "Abstract": "CDSS (computerized decision support system) for medical diagnostics have been studied for long. This study was undertaken to investigate how different preferences of Learning Styles (LS) of psychiatrists might affect acceptance, use and perceived usefulness of a CDSS for diagnostics in psychiatry.\n49 psychiatrists (specialists and non-specialists) from 3 different clinics volunteered to participate in this study and to use the CDSS to diagnose a paper-based case (based on a real patient). LS, attitudes to CDSS and complementary data were obtained via questionnaires and interviews. To facilitate the study, a special version of the CDSS was created, which automatically could log interaction details.\nThe LS preferences (according to Kolb) of the 49 physicians turned out as follows: 37% were Assimilating, 31% Converging, 27% Accommodating and 6% Diverging. The CDSS under study seemed to favor psychiatrists with abstract conceptualization information perceiving mode (Assimilating and Converging learning styles).A correlation between learning styles preferences and computer skill was found. Positive attitude to computer-aided diagnostics and learning styles preferences was also found to correlate. Using the CDSS, the specialists produced only 1 correct diagnosis and the non-specialists 2 correct diagnoses (median values) as compared to the three predetermined correct diagnoses of the actual case. Only 10% had all three diagnoses correct, 41 % two correct, 47 % one correct and 2 % had no correct diagnose at all.\nOur results indicate that the use of CDSS does not guarantee correct diagnosis and that LS might influence the results.

However, professionals active in the mental health care of people with intellectual disability (ID) have not shown the same degree of interest. The author of this article, who has had a liberal amount of rewarding experiences with the developmental approach in the field of ID, considers the developmental perspective to be innovative and very useful in psychiatric assessment, diagnosis and treatment of this population. The aim of the article is to stimulate a wider application of the developmental perspective as well as to challenge a professional discussion on this issue.\nBasic assumptions of the developmental perspective are discussed and assessment tools and methods are described.\nIn a case vignette, the advantages of developmentally based assessment are emphasized. Emotional development and personality development are viewed as the developmental components that play an important role in adaptive and maladaptive behaviour as well as in the onset and presentation of psychopathology. It is clear that interpretative insight into the totality of the psychosocial aspects of these individuals cannot only be obtained by measuring the level of cognitive development. A wider frame of mind is needed for unambiguous psychiatric diagnostics. Therefore, a replacement of the three dimensional paradigm (bio-psycho-social) by a four dimensional one (bio-psycho-socio-developmental) for the assessment and diagnosis of persons with ID is proposed."}, {"Title": "[Inpatient treatment of mother and child in psychiatry: relevant data of mother and child].", "Abstract": "A mentally ill mother may directly increase the probability for the child to develop clinically relevant psychiatric disorders during lifetime.

Results Of the 520 patients who were included in the study, 272 were female and 248 were male. Ninety-two patients were asked to have psychiatric consultation and when consultation results of these patients were examined it was seen that 67 of them (61.7%) were given a psychiatric diagnosis. Of the 67 patients who were given a psychiatric diagnosis, 34 (50.7%) were female and 33 (49.3%) were male. Mean age of the patients was 39.4 (the youngest being 24 and the oldest 63). It was established that 35.9% of patients (24 individuals) were diagnosed as depressive disorder, 29.8% (20 individuals) as anxiety disorder, 13.4% (nine individuals) as mixed depressive anxiety disorder, 13.4% (nine individuals) as borderline personality disorder and 7.5% (five individuals) as obsessive-compulsive disorder, and that psychiatric treatment was started in 91% of patients.

Paradigms 1 and 2 study aggregate genetic risk factors inferred from patterns of resemblance in relatives. Paradigms 3 and 4 study individual susceptibility genes localized on the human genome. Paradigms 1, 2, and 3 are statistical in nature, while paradigm 4 is biological. Genetic risk factors reflect the statistical signals from susceptibility genes. Whether it will be possible to identify all the susceptibility genes that underlie genetic risk factors is uncertain. Furthermore, given current research methods, the inability to detect susceptibility genes cannot disconfirm evidence for genetic risk factors. While paradigms 3 and 4 can provide great explanatory power by tracing etiologic pathways back to basic biological mechanisms, genetic epidemiology can also provide important etiologic insights, albeit of a less basic nature. While paradigms 3 and 4 may eventually replace paradigms 1 and 2, this shift is unlikely to occur quickly.

In vitro studies indicate that lithium can induce renal medullary interstitial cell cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) protein expression via inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). Both COX1 and COX2 are expressed in the kidney. Renal prostaglandins have been suggested to play an important role in lithium-induced polyuria. The present studies examined whether induction of the COX2 isoform contributes to LiCl-induced polyuria. Four days after initiation of lithium treatment in C57 BL/6J mice, urine volume increased in LiCl-treated mice by fourfold compared with controls (P < 0.0001) and was accompanied by decreased urine osmolality. This was temporally associated with increased renal COX2 protein expression and increased urinary PGE(2) excretion, whereas COX1 levels remained unchanged. COX2 inhibition significantly blunted lithium-induced polyuria (P < 0.0001) and reduced urinary PGE(2) levels. Lithium-associated polyuria was also seen in COX1-/- mice and was associated with increased urinary PGE(2). COX2 inhibition completely prevented polyuria and PGE(2) excretion in COX1-/- mice, suggesting that COX2, but not COX1, plays a critical role in lithium-induced polyuria. Lithium also induced renal medullary COX2 protein expression in congenitally polyuric antidiuretic hormone (AHD)-deficient rats, demonstrating that lithium-induced COX2 protein expression is not secondary to altered ADH levels or polyuria. Lithium also decreased renal medullary GSK-3beta activity, and this was temporally related to increased COX2 expression in the kidney from lithium-treated mice, consistent with a tonic in vivo suppression of COX2 expression by GSK-3 activity.

All published articles (n=3270) were classified under formal aspects and were assigned to one of 30 categories by content. Inter-rater reliability was determined in 3 years from different eras (1957, 1977, 1997). With kappa values between 0.65 and 0.81 the inter-rater reliability was moderate to good. The mean number of authors and the mean number of references in the articles has been increasing continuously, particularly within the last decade. The mean number of words per article has been relatively constant. In nearly all 5-year periods, most of the articles came from Heidelberg, Munich and Berlin. In addition to original articles, review articles were introduced in 1971 and medical education articles in 1978. Since 1955 the \"Nervenarzt\" has been publishing the communications of the German Psychiatric and Neurological Society. Original articles with data reports and articles using statistics have been increasing continuously since the 1960s, reflecting an increasing evidence-based orientation of psychiatry. The currently accepted scientific standard was introduced in the early 1990s. The last decade, the \"decade of the brain\", not only yielded a high proportion of articles on biological issues but also indicated an increasing interest in institutions of psychiatric care and psychotherapy. On the other hand, links to related disciplines such as philosophy, sociology and psychology seem to have got lost. The percentage of articles from abroad has been decreasing within the last 2 decades. In comparison, the American Journal of Psychiatry, the Archives of General Psychiatry and the British Journal of Psychiatry have been publishing a higher percentage of original articles, particularly randomised controlled trials."}, {"Title": "[Care requirements for severe mental disorders. Scientific evidence for integration of clinical psychiatry and community psychiatry].", "Abstract": "In Germany it is not clear which forms of community mental health care should be encouraged to meet the needs particularly of the severely mentally ill. We performed a literature review of systematic meta-analyses and controlled trials and show that a set of well-evaluated and effective psychiatric care systems is available, of which only a few are being implemented in Germany. It becomes obvious that in Germany organizational requirements for an integration of psychiatric services are not being adequately met, particularly in the case of schizophrenia. Team-based assertive community treatment, crisis intervention teams, community mental health teams, and modern job rehabilitation programs, which have been established primarily in English-speaking countries, could not be effectively adapted for German psychiatric care. At the same time many psychiatric care models have been poorly evaluated. Given the available scientific evidence we comment on future requisites and further developments in German psychiatry to meet the growing need of care for people with severe mental illnesses."}, {"Title": "Is there a case for a specialist forensic psychiatry service for the elderly?", "Abstract": "The number of elderly offenders in England and Wales is increasing. There is, therefore, a concern that their needs may not be met by existing forensic services. However, there is a paucity of information on elderly patients referred to existing forensic psychiatric units.\nData on patients over the age of 65 years referred to a large medium secure forensic psychiatric unit in London were collected for a 13-year period using a retrospective design. The sample was divided into those who had first offended before the age of 65 and those who had offended after the age of 65. Data was also collected on victims of the offences.\n5477 referrals were made during the study period. Those aged over 65 years accounted for 78 (1.4%) of all referrals. These 78 referrals were for 55 patients. Forty-five of these had offended. Case notes of 42 patients from this group were screened. Sexual and violent offences accounted respectively for 20 (47%) and 15 (36%) of offences. 31% had no psychiatric disorder but organic disorders accounted for 21% of cases. Only eight (19%) required admission to the medium secure unit. Fourteen (33%) had first offended after the age of 65 while others were known to either the forensic services or criminal justice system before the age of 65. The two groups did not differ from each other.\nThe elderly accounted for very few referrals to the medium secure forensic service, yet there is a high prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in both remand and sentenced elderly prisoners. Therefore, elderly offenders with psychiatric morbidity may benefit from specialist old age psychiatric forensic services, perhaps at a supraregional level."}, {"Title": "Molecular and cytogenetic characterization of a non-mosaic isodicentric Y chromosome in a patient with Klinefelter syndrome.", "Abstract": "We report on an adult male with Klinefelter phenotype and an isodicentric Y chromosome (47,XX,+idic(Y)(q12)), a combination which has to the best of our knowledge not been reported before. The patient was hospitalized in forensic psychiatry because of repeated delinquency, aggressive, aberrant and inappropriate behavior, and borderline intelligence. Molecular cytogenetic studies (FISH) showed that the SRY gene was present on both ends of the idicY, while there was only one signal for the Yq subtelomere probe. Molecular investigations by multiplex PCR, using STS markers covering the short and long arm of the Y chromosome did not indicate a deletion of Y chromosomal material. Molecular investigations of STR markers located on Xp22.3 and Xq28 indicated paternal origin of the additional X chromosome and an error in paternal meiosis I. Results of FISH analysis and molecular investigations are compatible with a phenotype as described for individuals with a 48,XXYY karyotype and support the findings that isodicentric Y chromosomes are frequently accompanied by other sex chromosomal abnormalities."}, {"Title": "Adjusting for partially missing baseline measurements in randomized trials.", "Abstract": "Adjustment for baseline variables in a randomized trial can increase power to detect a treatment effect. However, when baseline data are partly missing, analysis of complete cases is inefficient. We consider various possible improvements in the case of normally distributed baseline and outcome variables. Joint modelling of baseline and outcome is the most efficient method. Mean imputation is an excellent alternative, subject to three conditions. Firstly, if baseline and outcome are correlated more than about 0.6 then weighting should be used to allow for the greater information from complete cases. Secondly, imputation should be carried out in a deterministic way, using other baseline variables if possible, but not using randomized arm or outcome. Thirdly, if baselines are not missing completely at random, then a dummy variable for missingness should be included as a covariate (the missing indicator method). The methods are illustrated in a randomized trial in community psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Vagus nerve stimulation: current use and potential applications in child and adolescent psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Chronic and recurrent major depressive episodes are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and available treatments often are ineffective or only partially effective. This issue is of particular concern in children and adolescents, because major affective disorders often begin early in life and follow a chronic, progressive course. Because the current treatment armamentarium for depressive episodes in this age group is limited, the investigation for safe and effective treatment interventions is warranted. Vagus nerve stimulation therapy has proven safety, tolerability, and efficacy in the treatment of epilepsy, and early findings suggest safety and efficacy in the treatments of adults with chronic and recurrent treatment-resistant mood disorders. This intervention also holds promise as a potential treatment in children and adolescents, although research is currently lacking."}, {"Title": "Emerging brain-based interventions for children and adolescents: overview and clinical perspective.", "Abstract": "Electroencephalogram biofeedback (EBF), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) are emerging interventions that attempt to directly impact brain function through neurostimulation and neurofeedback mechanisms. This article provides a brief overview of each of these techniques, summarizes the relevant research findings, and examines the implications of this research for practice standards based on the guidelines for recommending evidence based treatments as developed by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). EBF meets the \"Clinical Guidelines\" standard for ADHD, seizure disorders, anxiety, depression, and traumatic brain injury. VNS meets this same standard for treatment of refractory epilepsy and meets the lower \"Options\" standard for several other disorders. rTMS meets the standard for \"Clinical Guidelines\" for bipolar disorder, unipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Several conditions are discussed regarding the use of evidence based thinking related to these emerging interventions and future directions."}, {"Title": "How representative of everyday clinical populations are schizophrenia patients enrolled in clinical trials?", "Abstract": "There has been considerable discussion whether clinical trials accurately depict everyday practice. Restrictive inclusion/exclusion criteria, ethical considerations, differences in the severity of psychopathology between clinical and trial patients, or safety issues may bias results, which in turn may rather represent outcome for the \"ideal\" than for the \"average\"patient. Therefore, translation into psychiatric practice may be difficult.\nA retrospective case-control study was performed. Schizophrenia inpatients at the LMU Department of Psychiatry, Munich, Germany, who had participated in clinical trials were compared to regular patients serving as controls. Probands and controls were matched by DSM-IV diagnosis, gender and age. The AMDP module, CGI and GAF were used to compare psychopathology. In addition, charts were reviewed for medication dosages, concurrent medical and neurological illness, and clinical history such as age of onset or family history.\nA total of 200 probands (100/100) were enrolled in the study. With respect to psychopathology, formally thought disordered or suicidal patients were significantly less likely to be study participants (n = 3) than controls (n = 22; p < or = 0.05). Similarly, negative schizophrenia symptoms were significantly less often present in study participants (n = 17) than in controls (n = 38; p < or = 0.05). Study participants were also medically and neurologically healthier than controls. (p = 0.05 respectively). No differences in overall illness severity as depicted by CGI and GAF were observed.\nWe found the patients included in our clinical trials representative of the patient encountered in routine clinical practice. Adherence to inclusion and exclusion criteria prevents inclusion of severely ill (e. g. suicidal) patients requiring a more intensive treatment setting. Illness severity was found to be similar in trial participants and controls, and indicates an overall comparably severe psychopathology. The more chronic, rather treatment refractory patients were also not reflected in the trial participant pool; this population may arguably not represent the average clinical patient either. A more careful administration of antipsychotic medication was found in trial participants and may effectively be considered \"good clinical practice\"."}, {"Title": "Burden of relatives and predictors of burden. Baseline results from the Munich 5-year-follow-up study on relatives of first hospitalized patients with schizophrenia or depression.", "Abstract": "In the present study, part of the Munich 5-year follow-up study on key relatives of first-hospitalized schizophrenic and depressive patients, baseline results with respect to relatives' burden and predictors of burden are presented. Basing on a transactional stress model the following hypothesis was tested: the impact of the patients' illness on their relatives' stress outcome is moderated by the psychosocial resources of the relatives. Stress outcome was measured in terms of objective and subjective burden, well-being, self-rated symptoms and global satisfaction with life. Potential moderating variables included age and gender, generalized stress response and illness-related coping strategies, beliefs of control,perceived social support,personality factors, expressed emotion and life stressors. A total of 83 relatives, whose ill family members had been hospitalized in the Department of Psychiatry of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich for the first time, participated in the study. Findings did not entirely support the hypothesis. On the one hand, relatives' stress outcome was independent of the objective stressors (severity of the illness, kind of symptoms, level of psychosocial functioning at admission). On the other hand, burden was significantly associated with several psychosocial resources and dispositions of the relatives. Multivariate linear regression analyses indicated that expressed emotion, emotion-focused coping strategies and generalized negative stress response are the most relevant predictors of burden. It is argued that a multidimensional approach in burden assessment is necessary and has relevant implications for improving family intervention strategies."}, {"Title": "[The syndrome of genital retraction from a transcultural psychiatric point of view. Chinese suo yang, Indonesian koro and non-Asian forms (koro-like symptoms)].", "Abstract": "The present article reviews the syndrome of genital retraction (SGR) from the perspective of transcultural psychiatry. It is best known as a culture-bound syndrome in Asia, e. g. koro in Indonesia or suo yang in Southern China, where it can be also observed in so-called epidemics. The syndrome is characterised by the sensation that the genitals are shrinking and being pulled back into the abdomen; this perception is associated with fear of death, because the subjects expect to die as soon as the genital has disappeared completely. Particularly in the case of suo yang, the involvement of local traditional concepts of illness can be established. In the Western world, however, SGR is observed only in single cases. The symptoms are less dramatic and do not show a particular cultural context. This form of SGR is called \"koro-like\" (koro-like symptoms, KLS). In contrast to the Asian form, KLS are not observed in healthy subjects, but as an unspecific syndrome related to other neuropsychiatric illnesses. In this review, we compare both forms of the SGR in terms of symptoms, cultural aspects and therapeutic strategies."}, {"Title": "Affective dysregulation and dissociative experience in female patients with borderline personality disorder: a startle response study.", "Abstract": "Affective dysregulation and dissociation are currently discussed as core features of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Affective dysregulation is hypothesized to be correlated with increased amygdala functioning and dissociation is linked to inhibited processing on the amygdala and dampened autonomic output, according to the corticolimbic disconnection model of dissociation from Sierra and Berrios [Biological Psychiatry 44 (1998) 898]. We assessed startle response, which is mainly mediated by the amygdala, to investigate the relationship between affective dysregulation and dissociation. We hypothesized that patients with BPD would reveal enhanced responses to startling tones, but that these would be lessened by the presence of state dissociative experiences. 21 unmedicated female patients with BPD and 21 healthy female controls listened to 15 startling tones (95-dB, 500-ms, 1000-Hz) while heart rate, skin conductance and orbicularis oculi electromyogram responses were measured. Covariance analysis showed that the BPD group had a significantly higher startle response in the electromyogram as compared to controls. Furthermore, present-state dissociative experiences significantly influenced the startle response. Patients with low dissociative experiences revealed enhanced startle responses whereas patients with high dissociative experiences showed reduced responses. Our data support affective dysregulation in BPD as well as the corticolimbic disconnection model of dissociation, at least for EMG. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of assessing present-state dissociation in basic research as well as psychotherapy."}, {"Title": "Inhibition of return in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "The present study is aimed at replicating and extending previous results by Nelson et al. [Psychiatry Res. 49 (1993) 183], who found decreased inhibition of return (IOR) in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Thirty OCD patients, 14 psychiatric, and 14 healthy controls participated in a visual cueing experiment. The task required detection of a target stimulus at one of two possible locations. Prior to the target, an uninformative cue appeared at one of these two locations. The Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA) between the cue and the target was systematically varied. We were especially interested in whether severity of OCD symptoms would be negatively correlated with inhibition for previously occupied locations. In accordance with prior research on healthy participants all groups displayed a comparable response pattern: facilitation at the short SOA condition and increasing IOR for the longer SOA conditions. Medication, comorbid depression, and OCD severity did not consistently moderate these effects."}, {"Title": "[Ecology of the brain. A systemic view for psychiatry and psychotherapy].", "Abstract": "Present neurobiological concepts of the mind-brain relationship often tend towards a reductionist view of subjectivity. In contrast to this, an ecological or systemic view of the brain is outlined which regards cognition and consciousness as components in a circular causality of organism and environment. In these cyclic processes, the brain functions as an organ of transformation which mutually translates elementary and complex system states into each other, thus allowing the organism to develop integral options of perception and action in its environment. Since these interactions, on their part, continuously change the microstructure of the brain, it has to be regarded as an organ that is formed biologically, socially as well as historically. The consequences of this ecological conception for our view of mental illness, for therapeutic approaches and for the role of subjectivity in psychiatry are pointed out."}, {"Title": "The complexities of individual financial conflicts of interest.", "Abstract": "Academic health centers (AHCs) are unique resources that are critical for the advancement of science and the training of health care providers, scientists, and educators. AHCs depend on public trust. Certain financial relationships between medical school faculty and industry create situations that have the potential to be deleterious to AHCs. Yet, the translation of clinically relevant, scientific advances to products that directly impact patients' lives benefits from entrepreneurial activities, and such activities necessitate interactions between academia and industry. Society has a vested interest in protecting human research participants, maintaining objectivity in scientific research, and encouraging creative research with clinical applications. Conflicts of interest (COI) committees have been created by AHCs to evaluate faculty financial COI and to develop strategies to eliminate, reduce, or manage such conflicts. Issues involving financial COI are relevant to psychiatry. These issues are reviewed from the perspective of regulatory oversight provided by a medical school's COI committee."}, {"Title": "[Electroconvulsive therapy at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Munich. Development during the years 1995-2002].", "Abstract": "So far, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been proven to be a reliable and the most effective somatic treatment of depression or schizophrenia. This holds especially true for disturbances, which are refractory to pharmacological treatments.\nWe evaluated 4803 treatments in 445 patients. Main outcome criteria were efficacy and tolerability of treatment. Moreover, prospectively recorded neurophysiological parameters that might influence treatment outcome and treatment modalities and were assessed in a retrospective study design.\nDuring the last 7 years developmental changes show an increasing call for ECT treatment. Despite not being able to satisfy all demands the number of treatments more than doubled during the time period investigated. According to the latest scientific knowledge, especially in unipolar ECT, higher stimulation energy has been used to provide better treatment efficacy. Nevertheless, this was accompanied by a lower incidence of cognitive side effects. Due to the better tolerability of the treatment and the prospective neurophysiological indices, it appears that treatment quality has improved in recent years. Overall treatment efficacy was not improved, but could be maintained on a stable high level. This is presumably due to a stronger negative selection of patients with more pharmacotherapy-refractory disturbances.\nECT still represents an important option in the treatment of therapy-resistant depression and schizophrenia despite recent progress in neuropsychopharmacology."}, {"Title": "[Differential indications for atypical neuroleptics: Amisulprid, Clozapin, Olanzapin, Quetiapin und Risperidon. Results of a pilot study of prescription habits in psychiatric clinical usage in the BRD].", "Abstract": "With the introduction of atypical neuroleptics, the therapy of schizophrenia has been improved by a group of antipsychotic substances characterized by better tolerability concerning extrapyramidal side effects and higher efficiency against negative symptoms. However, these atypical antipsychotics are not a homogeneous class of drugs but rather represent a group of substances with very different neurobiologic, pharmacologic, and clinical features. This fact and the growing variety of available atypical neuroleptics illustrate the difficulty in choosing the \"right\" antipsychotic drug for each patient. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate preliminary empirical data for possible differential indication of atypical neuroleptics by a questionnaire-based survey of 192 physicians in ten psychiatric hospitals active in the biological psychiatry work group of the German Federal Directors' Conference."}, {"Title": "[Neurogenesis. Relevance for pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of psychiatric diseases].", "Abstract": "Research into neurogenesis, i.e., the growth of new neurons in the adult brain, is leaving the area of pure basic science and gaining relevance for clinical disciplines such as psychopharmacology and molecular psychiatry. Neurogenesis is proposed to play a crucial role in psychiatric disorders which exhibit degenerative alterations, neural maldevelopment, and changes in neural plasticity as potentially important pathophysiological factors. Especially in dementia, drug addiction, and schizophrenic and affective psychoses, disruption of adult neurogenesis could thus represent a considerable pathogenetic element. Interestingly, several psychotropic drugs (e.g., antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics) are able to modify neurogenesis significantly. Further elucidation of the importance and implications of neurogenesis may concomitantly result in better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of mental disorders and increased knowledge of the mechanisms of action of psychotropic substances. Furthermore, this may support the development of promising innovative therapeutic approaches in clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Does the level of LDL cholesterol moderate a relationship between DRD4 and novelty seeking?", "Abstract": "This study examined the role of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level in the association between Dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) polymorphism and temperament dimension novelty seeking. From the on-going population based study of \"Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns\", 78 men and women responded to the novelty seeking scale of the temperament and character inventory [Archives of General Psychiatry 44 (1987) 573] and were apolipoprotein E (apoE) and DRD4 genotyped. DRD4 polymorphism was related to disorderliness, a component of novelty seeking, in subjects with high LDL cholesterol level but not in subjects with low LDL cholesterol level. This finding did not change after adjustment for apoE polymorphism. Our findings suggest that the genetic determination of temperament may be dependent on biological factors, such as LDL cholesterol."}]
